Chapter 1: The Brewing of the Reform and Opening Up in the New Era and the Restoration and Reestablishment of the Correct Line
I. The Generation of Political Reconciliation in the Process of Wavering Progress
During the transition period from 1976 to 1978, the generation of political reconciliation mainly occurred through the restoration of Deng Xiaoping's leadership position, the restoration of the college entrance examination system, and the redressment of the Tiananmen Incident.
1. The Restoration of Deng Xiaoping's Leadership Position and the Redressment of the Tiananmen Incident
After the defeat of the "Gang of Four," although the political forces that supported the "Cultural Revolution" were toppled from the highest level of the central government, the top leadership of the party and the country, which was crucial to the future and fate of China after the "Cultural Revolution," had not yet made decisive progress.
Mao Zedong, who received the order from Mao Zedong before his death, later served as the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and premier of the State Council. With the support of the Central Political Bureau and executing the will of the people, Hua Guofeng took decisive measures to overthrow the "Gang of Four" and put an end to the Cultural Revolution. In the process of overthrowing the "Gang of Four," Hua Guofeng, in his position as the core of the central leadership, played an important role. The vast majority of the people celebrated and raised their glasses in joy.
At the beginning of the overthrow of the "Gang of Four," Hua Guofeng seized the opportunity to criticize and denounce them, stabilize the situation, and gained support from within and outside the party. In various parts of the country, the gang factions of the "Gang of Four" were gradually investigated and normal production and work orders were restored. Efforts were also made to restore the national economy, with obvious results. However, a contradictory problem did not receive a satisfactory solution: on one hand, the criticism and denunciation of the "Gang of Four" was carried out, but on the other hand, there were great efforts to limit the accountability for the harm caused by the extreme leftist policies of the "Gang of Four," especially the prohibition of touching the mistakes made by Mao Zedong in his later years. As a result, the work of rectifying the wrongful cases of the "Cultural Revolution" proceeded slowly, and the rectification of major problems was obstructed.
As early as October 26, 1976, Hua Guofeng told the person in charge of the Central Propaganda Department: "Do not criticize anything that Chairman Mao has said or agreed to." On November 18, Wang Dongxing said at the Central Committee's propaganda work meeting: "Chairman Mao has already issued a document on Deng Xiaoping. We must uphold everything that Chairman Mao has said or instructed. We will not go wrong." On February 7, 1977, the "Two Newspapers and One Magazine" published an editorial titled "Study the Documents and Grasp the Main Points," which clearly put forward the principle of "two whatevers": "We resolutely uphold all the decisions made by Chairman Mao, and we always adhere to Chairman Mao's instructions without wavering." The "two whatevers" aimed to uphold Mao Zedong's "banner," including the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution," but it contradicted the development of the situation. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, in view of the increasing calls from within and outside the party to rehabilitate the Tiananmen Incident and allow Deng Xiaoping to emerge, Chen Yun, in his written speech at the Central Work Conference in March, proposed four points affirming the Tiananmen Incident and fully supported Deng Xiaoping's return to the leadership of the Party Central Committee. Wang Zhen also made a similar statement and received support from many people. Vice Chairmen Ye Jianying and Li Xiannian also clearly agreed. In this situation, Hua Guofeng stated that "at the appropriate time, allow Comrade Deng Xiaoping to come out and work." In July 1977, the Third Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee formally decided to restore Deng Xiaoping's work and position.
Restoring Deng Xiaoping's leadership position meant that the 1976 Tiananmen Incident, which was suppressed by the "Gang of Four," should be redressed. However, the political identities and situations of those who participated in the Tiananmen Square "April Fifth" Movement, who had experienced their hardships with Deng Xiaoping, remained vague. As a result, a spontaneous movement arose among the public to vindicate the Tiananmen Incident: 16 teachers from the Chinese Language Teaching Research Group of Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute (signed as "Tong Huaizhou") spontaneously collected and spread the "Tiananmen Poetry Extract" through mimeograph printing. People rushed to buy and copy it, creating a great social impact. Shanghai worker Zong Fuxian wrote a four-act play called "In Silence," praising the "April Fifth" Movement in Tiananmen Square and exposing the ugly face of the "Gang of Four" and their followers. The play was successively performed in Shanghai and Beijing, causing a sensation. The first issue of the magazine "Chinese Youth" published the deeds of Beijing young worker Han Zhixiong in the "April Fifth" Movement (later severely criticized by Wang Dongxing and the magazine was confiscated). It can be said that the vindication of the Tiananmen Incident was not achieved overnight, but rather the result of the unremitting efforts and persistence of the forces of social justice from the bottom up.
Until November 14, 1978, after approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China officially made a decision to rectify the Tiananmen Square incident, and it was announced in the Beijing Daily on the 15th: "On Qingming Festival in 1976, the masses gathered at Tiananmen Square to mourn our beloved Premier Zhou, purely out of infinite love, infinite nostalgia, and deep mourning for Premier Zhou, purely out of deep hatred for the heinous crimes of the 'Gang of Four' that harmed the country and the people. It reflects the wishes of the hundreds of millions of people nationwide, it is a revolutionary action, and all comrades who were persecuted because of this should be rectified, and their reputations restored." However, it was evident that it was not enough for such a nationally influential event to be announced for rectification only in local newspapers.
Xinhua News Agency President Zeng Tao, People's Daily Editor-in-Chief Hu Jiwei, and Guangming Daily Editor-in-Chief Yang Xiguang keenly noticed this report and extracted the specific paragraph to publish it as a separate news article, with the title "Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China announces that the 'Tiananmen Square incident' was a complete revolutionary action", thus greatly elevating the significance of this news. It is worth mentioning that Xinhua News Agency did not seek approval from the Central Politburo or report to any member of the Standing Committee when releasing this news. Afterwards, even Hu Yaobang said to Hu Jiwei, "Didn't you inform me about such an important matter?" The consideration of Zeng Tao and others at the time was: it is better not to seek consultation on this matter and let Xinhua News Agency take responsibility for it. Everyone appreciated Zeng Tao's courage and decisiveness.
After discussion and approval by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, Hua Guofeng, representing the Central Committee, announced at the Central Work Conference being held at that time: "The Tiananmen Square incident was a completely revolutionary mass movement, and the Tiananmen Square incident should be publicly and thoroughly rectified." Thus, the "Tiananmen Square incident" finally received rectification.
2. Starting the rectification of certain unjust, false, and erroneous cases
During the "Cultural Revolution," a large number of unjust, false, and erroneous cases were created, affecting a considerable number of social groups both inside and outside the party throughout the country. The grievances of these groups were not redressed, and their basic political rights, job rights, and basic living conditions were not ensured. Therefore, after the collapse of the "Gang of Four," the most immediate and urgent demand of the entire society was to rectify the unjust, false, and erroneous cases as soon as possible. This became the eager anticipation and strong desire of a wide range of social classes, including leading cadres at all levels who had suffered severe persecution.
In July 1977, the Third Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee decided to restore Deng Xiaoping's leadership position, revealing obvious political rationality and value. In the political report of the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in August, it was pointed out: "Regarding the problems left among cadres after the past political examination, they should be seriously and quickly addressed. For those who can work but have not been assigned work, they should be assigned work as soon as possible. For the elderly and frail who cannot work, proper arrangements should be made. For the few who need to make review conclusions, they should do so as soon as possible. All the slanderous words imposed by the 'Gang of Four' should be refuted." These important pieces of information opened up a gap for further clarifying historical rights and wrongs. In the hearts of those who had not been liberated, the light of hope began to ignite, concerning themselves, their families, relatives' fate, and future, and it burned brighter and brighter.
At that time, Hu Yaobang served as the Executive Vice President of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, and he had always been pondering the issue of accelerating the rectification of unjust, false, and erroneous cases and implementing cadre policies. On October 7, 1977, the People's Daily published a full-page article titled "Correcting the Cadre Line that the 'Gang of Four' has Reversed," written with the support of Hu Yaobang. The article pointed out with specificity: Some comrades, especially those involved in cadre work, have not been effective in their work because of the influence of the "Gang of Four." This has led to some capable cadres with a correct understanding of the line not being assigned work, many cadres undergoing review having not reached correct conclusions, and bad elements infiltrating the cadre ranks not being dealt with. All of these indicate that implementing the cadre policies of the Party is still a serious battle task.
The article emphasizes the need to break through resistance and overturn the false accusations and erroneous conclusions imposed by the gang of four on many cadres. This article has provoked widespread social resonance, and relevant departments of the central government have received more than 10,000 letters from cadres and the masses within a month, all expressing agreement with the views expressed in the article and the proposed measures. The People's Daily continues to publish commentary articles on the implementation of cadre policies and publishes excerpts from letters from the masses, reporting on the implementation of cadre policies in some local areas. This further spurred people's emotions of rectifying unjust grievances and they have been striving for early solutions to their problems through means such as petitions and appeals.
However, the implementation of cadre policies and the rectification of unjust cases still face significant obstacles. On the one hand, in the organizational departments of the central government, some regions, and units, as well as among individuals influenced by the gang of four's factional system, there are always excuses to delay and a lack of serious implementation of the Party's cadre policies. On the other hand, many people still have lingering fear and concerns, worrying that dealing with the inherited problems in reviewing and handling cadres, especially correcting those erroneous cases, will negate the achievements of the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." A typical example is the former First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Shu Tong, who went to the Central Organization Department to request policy implementation and job assignments, but was blocked by the then head of the Central Organization Department and was not even allowed to stay in the department's guesthouse. There are over 6,000 such cadres "suspended" or "side-lined" in central and national organs alone, and these people continue to petition, but find no help.
This incident had a great impact on Hu Yaobang and further strengthened his determination to promote the implementation of cadre policies. "If we don't go to hell, who will?" Hu Yaobang said, borrowing a line from Dante's Divine Comedy, "Our position is: If we don't jump into the oil pan, who will?" Now we are also at a critical moment of contending with a new level 12 typhoon. Since we have firmly and confidently taken the first step, we will never retreat and strive to expand the breakthrough that has already been made. Hu Yaobang also analyzed: It seems that resolving cadre issues will still be an arduous task, which requires our determination to overcome each obstacle one by one. He organized comrades from the Central Party School to write a second call-to-action article entitled "Chairman Mao's Cadre Policy Must be Seriously Implemented", criticizing behaviors similar to persistently clinging to the wrong organizational line.
At this time, veteran comrades like Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun also believed that it was necessary to strengthen the leadership of the organizational departments. Some organizational departments needed to adjust and strengthen their capacities and vigorously recommended Hu Yaobang to be the Minister of the Central Organization Department.
Hu Yaobang took office in the Central Organization Department on December 15, 1977. That morning at 8 o'clock, the front courtyard of the Central Organization Department was filled with excitement, firecrackers were booming, and all cadre staff welcomed the arrival of the new minister with sincere trust and joy. This enthusiastic scene reflects the strong desire of the majority of cadres and masses to completely rectify unjust cases. After that, the number of petitions received by the Central Organization Department increased day by day. In January 1978, the number of people petitioning every day reached several hundred, and the number of appeal letters reached six bags. Some letters even had Hu Yaobang's name directly mentioned.
With the support of Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and other veteran comrades, Hu Yaobang, who joined the Chinese Red Army at the age of 14 as a "little red devil," with selflessness and fearlessness, broke through the various restrictions and taboos set by the "two whatevers," and boldly organized and led a series of urgent work in the Central Organization Department to implement cadre policies and rectify unjust cases.
At the first working meeting after assuming the position of the Central Organization Department, Hu Yaobang proposed that it is the department's responsibility to rectify wrongful cases and implement cadre policies. He said: During the "Cultural Revolution" alone, there were major cases such as the Tiananmen Incident, the "61 People" problem, the Peng Dehuai case, the Tao Zhu case, the Wang Renzhong case, the Inner Mongolia "Neiren Party" problem, the so-called "traitor group" problem in the Northeast, the "traitor group" problem of Xinjiang's Ma Mingfang and others, the case of speaking out for Liu Shaoqi's grievances and "viciously attacking the great leader", the case of "viciously attacking Vice Commander Lin", and the "current counter-revolutionaries" who were executed. No one can say exactly how many victims were involved in these cases. In the previous political movements before the "Cultural Revolution", as well as some wrongful cases before the establishment of New China, including the wrongful cases in the Central Soviet Area in the 1930s, it can be said that there are "mountains of unresolved cases", while the current situation of the Central Organization Department is "difficult to move forward".
Hu Yaobang explicitly stated that the clearing and implementation of wrongful cases since the establishment of New China and during the "Cultural Revolution" is the primary task of the organization department. As for the historical legacy issues before the establishment of New China, whether it was due to historical conditions or the impact of war that prevented them from being resolved or not thoroughly resolved, we should also strive to thoroughly resolve them. No matter how difficult it is, we must have the determination to overcome all obstacles. He also greeted the people present and said: If any old comrades who have been wronged come to find me in the future, I will meet and talk with them. I ask that no one obstruct them. Any letter with the three characters "Hu Yaobang" written on the envelope should be promptly delivered to me. If there is no indication from me, I hope that no comrade will take the initiative to handle it or withhold it.
According to statistics, the Central Organization Department received 391,363 cases consisting of 1,730 volumes at that time, and 669 senior cadres were reviewed. Among them, 320 people were identified as having serious problems or contradictions with the enemy, accounting for 47.8% of the total number of cases reviewed. Among these people, there were 213 cadres at the deputy ministerial level, 71 members of the Central Committee and alternate members, 10 members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, 10 members of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and 7 deputy prime ministers.
From March to April 1978, Hu Yaobang organized and guided the Central Organization Department to hold seminars on researching difficult and unresolved cases in the central and state organs, as well as in some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. He personally attended the discussions or gave speeches, provided handling suggestions for hundreds of long-standing difficult cases, defined policy boundaries, and proposed four standards for implementing cadre policies: (1) Cases without conclusions should reach conclusions as soon as possible, and if the conclusions are incorrect, they should be corrected pragmatically; (2) Those who have not been assigned work should be appropriately allocated work, and those who are elderly and weak should be properly arranged; (3) The deceased should have a pragmatic conclusion, and the aftermath work should be done well; (4) The families and children of those who have been implicated should be resolved properly. The general policy is pragmatism and the method is the mass line.
Under the leadership of Hu Yaobang, the Central Organization Department issued more than forty guiding documents to liberate cadres and rectify wrongful cases. Over ten articles were published in newspapers, and policy commentaries totaling nearly one hundred thousand words were published in the "Organizational Work Communication". During his time in the Central Organization Department, Hu Yaobang was almost busy every day handling various types of letters. On average, he would handle 33 appeal letters from deputy bureau chiefs and party committee secretaries or positions above per day, and on the busiest day, he handled 200 letters. According to a member of the Central Organization Department recalling, in that year alone, Hu Yaobang approved 902 letters for the review bureau to handle. Through Hu Yaobang and the comrades of the Central Organization Department's relentless efforts and meticulous work, a considerable number of problems of middle and senior cadres were resolved, and their work and livelihood arrangements were properly handled.
As Hu Yaobang said, "When a wrongful case is rectified, people are greatly pleased." By July 1978, a total of 5,344 cadres were allocated and arranged according to policies in central and state organs, accounting for 87.2% of the originally unallocated cadres in 53 units of central and state organs, playing a leading role in freeing minds and rectifying chaos. Until August, among the main leaders in 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, 9 people were found to be implicated in the overthrow of the party by the "Gang of Four" and were dismissed from their posts, accounting for about one-third of the total number of main leaders in these areas. The central government also made significant adjustments to the leadership teams of 14 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and 23 ministries and commissions. This played an organizational guarantee role in stabilizing the situation, restoring and developing the national economy, and promoting the struggle of exposing and criticizing.
3. Restoring the college entrance examination system to give young students equal opportunities for development
On October 21, 1977, the People's Daily published the news of the restoration of the college entrance examination with an unusually eye-catching headline "Doing a good job in college admissions is the hope of the whole nation." The restoration of the college entrance examination marked the beginning of China's education reform and development in a new historical period, and it was also the prelude to the magnificent reform and opening up in China in the 1980s. At the end of that year, thousands of young intellectuals participated in the college entrance examination. With the knowledge accumulation from years of grassroots labor, most of them only had a short and hurried review, and with anxious and excited hearts, they rushed to the hastily established examination centers all over the country with various identities such as rural youth sent to the countryside, factory apprentices, demobilized soldiers, and unemployed at home. They participated in and witnessed the first college entrance examination after the "Cultural Revolution" that changed the era and the fate of a generation of young people. In that year, a total of 5.7 million people nationwide registered to take the college entrance examination, with an unprecedented age span of examinees, with the oldest being 37 years old and the youngest being 13 years old. However, the number of admissions that year was only slightly over 270,000. It was the most competitive year for the college entrance examination in New China.
At the end of the year, there were many people who, due to various reasons of their own, their families, and the society, missed the opportunity of the first restoration of the college entrance examination. Fortunately, the restoration of the college entrance examination in 1977 was only partial. Starting from 1978, college admissions were fully restored through a nationwide unified examination organized by the Ministry of Education. Each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government organized the examination, marking, and admission work locally. According to Deng Xiaoping's instructions, "At the same time as announcing the list of candidates for physical examination, announce the test scores of all candidates. The method of announcement shall be notified by the county (district) admissions committee to inform the candidates' respective units to relay to the candidates themselves." The publication of the examination scores was an important measure to improve the transparency of the admission examination process and played a key role in changing the social atmosphere, preventing nepotism and cheating, and promoting fair practices.
Due to the interruption of regular college admissions for ten years, more than 30 million young people and students in the country were eligible to register. However, the colleges and universities had just started to recover from the destruction of the "Cultural Revolution", and the conditions of school buildings and teaching staff were limited, unable to accommodate the large number of students. In 1978, the Ministry of Education decided to restore and establish 60 key universities and 55 ordinary universities and requested that each university expand enrollment by all means. As a result, in 1978, there were 6.1 million candidates for the national college entrance examination, with 402,000 admissions. The unprecedented scale of the examination still evokes nostalgia in many people's memories.
With doors wide open, talent surged forward. The backlog of talent for 11 years erupted at once. More than 670,000 people were fortunate enough to enter the hall of higher education, and more than 11 million young people successively registered to participate in the college entrance examination. This involved the considerations and concerns of countless families, units, and all sectors of society, and brought about a very extensive social impact.
Due to the abolition of the enrollment model for college students from workers, peasants, and soldiers based on power and background during the Cultural Revolution, the new enrollment system based on unified examinations and selective admission expanded the scope of enrollment to include high school graduates and young people from various professions. Many people who had never dared to imagine having any opportunity before were able to "stand up through their own efforts" and change their destinies. The phenomenon of "blank paper heroes" during the Cultural Revolution disappeared. The restoration of the college entrance examination stimulated the enthusiasm for learning among a generation of young people and began to form a mechanism of fair competition.
In 1977, since the comprehensive rectification had not yet been carried out, many candidates were not admitted due to family problems. However, candidates and their parents no longer remained silent and give up, but instead appealed and fought for their rights, resulting in the resolution of some issues. In this regard, People's Daily published a commentator article titled "Political Reviews in the College Entrance Examination Must Firmly Implement the Party's Policies," criticizing the tendency to assess candidates primarily based on their family and relatives' political history rather than their political performance. It pointed out that this one-sided and irresponsible practice was extremely harmful and seriously interfered with the implementation of the Party's policies. With the deepening of ideological rectification, the one-sided emphasis on the so-called "class line" in college entrance examination and enrollment work was resolved.
After the fall of the "Gang of Four," from a societal perspective, a significant change was the emergence of an atmosphere of social reconciliation. This change was largely due to the gradual resolution of the highly tense political relations in Chinese society. Not only did the college entrance examination resume comprehensively, but in March 1978, during the National Scientific Conference, Deng Xiaoping emphasized the important view that "science and technology are productive forces and also a great revolutionary force that propels history forward," reaffirming that the vast majority of intellectuals were already part of the working class. This reversed the "leftist" policies towards intellectuals that had been in place for many years. A "spring" that respected knowledge and talent emerged, greatly inspiring intellectuals in various fields such as science, education, and literature. People universally felt the long-lost atmosphere of social cohesion and reconciliation, which accelerated the restoration and reconstruction of normal social and living order, and the whole society began to show vitality.
II. Resolution of Theoretical Understanding and Ideological Obstacles
During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, not only did it cause severe damage to the national economy, but it also led to great confusion in ideological and theoretical aspects. With the restoration and development of the national economy starting in 1977, the theoretical field gradually clarified various erroneous ideas propagated during the Cultural Revolution by exposing and criticizing the fallacies of the "Gang of Four" in economic theory. It gradually restored the correct Marxist economic theory, the Party's pragmatism, and the correct criteria for testing truth, and correctly applied them in socialist construction.
1. The Great Debate in the Economic Theory Field on the Issues of Commodities, Circulation, and Distribution
The Stalinist model of planned economy is a highly centralized economic model. Therefore, commodity economy has always been in an awkward position in China. For many years, the commodity economy has been treated as something capitalist, to the point that even the simplest exchange of goods in rural markets was considered capitalist. Under this ideological guidance, the development of our country's commodity economy was greatly constrained, with a low degree of commercialization of agricultural products. Industrial products were far from meeting the daily needs of the people, and they could not provide sufficient machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides for agricultural development. The circulation of commodities was single-channel, and the goods people needed were often acquired through a "supply" system, while scarce goods had to be obtained through "vouchers." This is a characteristic of a shortage economy underdeveloped in terms of commodity economy. After the fall of the "Gang of Four," in order to get rid of the dilemma of a shortage economy, the first issue raised was the development of the commodity economy. In fact, to boost economic development, it is necessary to develop the commodity economy. This requires stripping away the "capitalist" shell attached to commodity production and circulation.
On December 5, 1977, the State Council issued a notice titled "Regarding the Convening of the National Urban and Rural Commerce and Learning from Daqing and Dazhai Conference," which pointed out that socialist commodity production and circulation are fundamentally different from capitalist commodity circulation. Currently, our country's commodity production is not excessive, but rather insufficient. Under the conditions where both public ownership and collective ownership coexist, socialist commodity production needs to be greatly developed. Only in this way can the economic power of socialism be strengthened, urban and rural capitalist activities be eliminated, and the material basis of proletarian dictatorship be strengthened. We must confidently promote socialist production and develop socialist commodity circulation. Although this notice carries the linguistic characteristics of that era, such as discussing the importance of commodity production and circulation from the perspective of "eliminating urban and rural capitalist activities," it nevertheless points out the essential differences between socialist and capitalist commodity economies, and proposes the confident development of the commodity economy, which was significant at that time.
On July 7, 1978, Hua Guofeng delivered a speech at the National Finance and Trade Learning from Daqing and Dazhai Conference. This speech draft was written by several comrades in the field of theory, and was modified multiple times by Hu Qiaomu. The speech analyzed the relationship between economic development and supply guarantee, essentially focusing on the interrelationships among the four components of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption, as all these components are indispensable. Production is the determining factor in the overall process of production, but exchange, distribution, and consumption also play significant roles in production, emphasizing that the development of commerce is a "strong promoter" of industrial and agricultural production development. This speech had a great impact after it was delivered.
In order to promote the confident development of commodity production and circulation, the theoretical group of the State Council Finance and Trade Team drafted the article titled "Refuting the Reactionary Fallacy of the 'Gang of Four' that Defames Socialist Commodity Production," expounding on the correct understanding of socialist commodity production. The article pointed out that commodity production must be allowed to exist in socialist society and be used to facilitate close connections between urban and rural areas. Only by vigorously developing commodity production and circulation can various needs of national construction and people's lives be met. The vigorous development of the socialist commodity economy is necessary to promote mutual reinforcement between industry and agriculture. Although these arguments still have shortcomings, they represent significant progress compared to the previous notion of viewing the commodity economy as a breeding ground for capitalism, where, for example, raising three ducks by rural members is considered socialist while raising five ducks is considered capitalist.
After progress was made in reevaluating the issues of commodity production and exchange, there were significant obstacles in clarifying the influence of the "left" on the issue of distribution according to work. This was because it involved Mao Zedong. As early as 1958, Mao Zedong regarded wage systems, bonuses, and the like as "bourgeois rights" and believed that these things were a regression from the communal life of military communism during the war. He had attempted to restore the system of supply. In 1974, Mao Zedong made the following statement during a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Poul Hartling: "In summary, China belongs to the socialist countries. Before liberation, it was similar to capitalism. Even now, we still implement the eight-grade wage system, distribution according to work, and monetary exchange. These have not changed much compared to the old society, what is different is the ownership has changed... "In this regard, it can only be restricted under the dictatorship of the proletariat."
The Gang of Four exaggerated the similarities between "distribution according to work" and the old society, and took it to extremes. In 1975, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan respectively published two articles titled "On the Comprehensive Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie" and "On the Social Basis of the Lin Biao Anti-Party Group". They claimed that distribution according to work was a bourgeois privilege, an important economic basis for the emergence of new bourgeoisie, and that it could only be restricted under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Due to their use of Mao Zedong's speeches, "abolishing bourgeois privileges" seemed to become the classic Marxist interpretation of the socialist distribution problem. At that time, various newspapers and magazines extensively propagated these ideas, leading to not only great theoretical confusion but also many practical difficulties, as distribution according to work and the principle of material interest were completely denied.
In January 1977, some people specifically criticized Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. However, Wang Dongxing, who was in charge of propaganda work at the time, disagreed. His reasoning was that Chairman Mao had read these two articles, so they could not be completely denied. Instead, the incorrect views within the articles were criticized without mentioning the authors by name. In practice, this actually set a taboo on rethinking the issue of distribution according to work. However, this did not prevent further and deeper discussions on the issue from taking place. In February 1977, with the participation of the National Economic Commission's Economic Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Economic Research Institute, the State Labor General Bureau, Peking University, and other units, a national economic theory discussion conference was decided to be held. It started with criticizing the fallacies of the Gang of Four regarding distribution according to work. In April, the first discussion conference was attended by over 100 theoretical workers from more than 30 units in Beijing. In June, the second discussion conference was attended by over 400 theoretical workers from nearly 100 units in Beijing.
Soon after Deng Xiaoping's comeback in July, he reacted to the economic circle's discussions. He said that the articles on distribution according to work were generally good, but he felt that they were not satisfying enough, lacking boldness in expression. On August 3rd, Deng Xiaoping and Yu Guangyuan talked about the articles on distribution according to work, saying they were basically well-written and stood firm, but were a bit hesitant in their message and needed to be revised after discussion. He pointed out that there should be appropriate material incentives; clearly stating that those who work less should receive less, and those who work more should receive more. On August 8th, during a symposium on scientific education work, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that when talking about distribution according to work, it essentially meant "more work, more gain; less work, less gain; no work, no gain." This issue, from theory to practice, requires research and resolution of many specific problems. It is not only a problem for the scientific community and the education sector but also a problem for the whole country.
"With more work, more gain; less work, less gain; no work, no gain" - Deng Xiaoping, in his unique way of expression, promoted the liberation of thought in the economic circle. On August 9th, the People's Daily published an article titled "Refuting Yao Wenyuan's Fallacy of Distribution According to Work Leading to the Emergence of the Bourgeoisie," directly criticizing the fallacies in Yao Wenyuan's article. From late October to early November, the economics circle held the third discussion conference on the issue of distribution according to work. In addition to the participation of over 500 theoretical workers from units in Beijing, over 300 theoretical workers from 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also attended the conference. More than 100 people gave speeches, indicating that the scale of the conference was growing. The number of articles published in newspapers such as People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and Economic Research has been increasing, and discussions in the field of economics have gradually extended to society.
From February 6th to March 5th, in 1978, the First Session of the Fifth National People's Congress was held. The government work report explicitly affirmed the principle of "those who do not work shall not eat, each according to their abilities and remuneration according to their work" throughout the entire socialist historical stage. It pointed out that in terms of distribution, we should avoid excessive disparities and also oppose egalitarianism, implement the principle of "more work, more pay; less work, less pay". All communes and brigades must earnestly implement quota management and the piece-rate system, implement equal pay for equal work between men and women. State-owned enterprise employees' wages are mainly determined by working hours, supplemented by piece-rate wages and incentives. A job allowance is provided for occupations with high labor intensity and poor working conditions. The principle of remuneration according to work was also included in the constitutional amendment passed at the conference.
According to Deng Xiaoping's opinion, the State Council Research Office organized the writing of articles on remuneration according to work. On March 28th, Deng Xiaoping met with the heads of the Research Office, Hu Qiaomu, Deng Liqun, Yu Guangyuan, etc., and said about the draft of the article, "I have read this article and it is well written. It explains that the nature of remuneration according to work is socialist, not capitalist. Some parts still need to be revised to address the practical problems that exist in the current system."
How to connect with practical problems? Deng Xiaoping outlined some of the ideas he formed through contemplation:
According to the principle of distributing based on the quantity and quality of labor, when determining the level of employee wages, the main factors to consider are the quality of their work, their level of skills, and the size of their contributions. Dealing with distribution issues should only be based on work, not politics or qualifications. We are implementing a policy of low wages, which will last for a considerable period of time. Currently, the highest wage for an eighth rank worker is just over 100 yuan, and in the future, as production develops, wages will gradually increase, and the amount of wages at all levels should increase. Currently, the wages of primary school teachers are too low. The labor that a good primary school teacher puts in is quite heavy, so their wages should be increased. In the future, some primary school teachers who teach very well can be evaluated as "special grade". Special grades should be established in all professions to encourage people to engage in their chosen careers for life.
An evaluation system should be implemented. The evaluation must be strict, comprehensive, and frequent. This should be done in all industries. There should be rewards and punishments, with clear distinctions between them. Different rewards should be given based on performance, whether it is good or poor, through the evaluation process. The bonus system should also be reinstated. Incentives should be given to inventors and those who have made special contributions. Those who have made significant achievements in scientific research can have their salary levels increased in addition to rewards for their inventions. The system of remuneration for contributions should also be restored and revised based on the new situation. There are many things to be done in implementing the principle of distribution according to work. Some issues need to be investigated and gradually resolved. Some systems need to be reinstated and established. The overall aim is to encourage everyone to strive for progress.
On May 5th, after being personally reviewed by Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, and others, an article entitled "Implementing the Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Work" was published in the name of a special commentator in the People's Daily. The article comprehensively argued for the socialist nature of distribution according to work, expounded on various forms of labor compensation according to work, and systematically clarified theoretical errors and confusion regarding distribution according to work. The article received wide social response after its publication. At the same time, it was criticized by leaders who adhered to the "Two Whatevers" principle. Wang Dongxing publicly criticized the article during a small meeting, stating that it "actually targeted the Chairman's ideology." Deng Xiaoping, on the other hand, believed that the article was Marxist. He also told the leaders of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, "We cannot make concessions in theory, compromising will lead to losing principles."
In August, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Institute of Economic Research, and other institutions held a special discussion on implementing the principle of distribution according to work in rural areas. Comrades from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and relevant central departments participated in the meeting. The participating comrades generally believed that the main tendency in agricultural distribution at the current stage is egalitarianism. Some comrades called for the need to improve management, stating that the principle of material interests must be implemented in order to make people care about the results of their labor from a material perspective. This principle could not be discussed in the past, but now it must be emphasized and applied in practical work. We must start from reality and not confine our thinking to certain concepts. Some economists also pointed out that despite the significant amount of investment by the state in agriculture over the past twenty years of collective ownership, agricultural production has not correspondingly developed. The reasons for this must be found in the relations of production. In order to elevate agriculture, it is necessary to strengthen the material foundation of agricultural production, but more importantly, the policies of equivalent exchange and distribution according to work must be earnestly implemented.
From October 25th to November 2nd, during the fourth meeting on distribution according to work, a key topic of discussion was whether the combination of distribution according to work, commodity production, and currency exchange could give rise to a new bourgeoisie. The majority of participants believed that socialist distribution according to work, commodity production, and currency exchange would not generate capitalism, nor could they form a new bourgeoisie. Moreover, some participants presented evidence from systematic social surveys to demonstrate that no new bourgeoisie member has emerged as a result of distribution according to work.
The discussion on the issue of distribution according to work in this stage was large in scale and long in duration, mainly clarifying the following issues: (1) Distribution according to work is the distribution principle of socialism, and it is by no means a factor of capitalism. (2) The right of equal exchange of equal labor in distribution according to work is both an equal right and an unequal right, and there is no system of hierarchy in distribution according to work. Distribution according to work will not produce capitalism and bourgeois elements. (3) Bonuses and piece-rate wages are not things of revisionism and should be restored and implemented. In the situation of correcting chaos, the large-scale discussion on the issue of distribution according to work has played a positive role in clarifying people's vague understanding.
At the same time, the theoretical circles also criticized the "Gang of Four" for slandering the development of production as "advocating the theory of productive forces". After discussion, several points of consensus were reached: (1) True socialism should be a more advanced mode of production than capitalism, and should create a higher level of productivity than capitalism. Socialism and poverty are incompatible, and poverty is not the essential requirement of the socialist system. (2) Our country is carrying out socialist construction in a country with relatively backward productivity, and we must take the road from poverty to prosperity, so that our country can quickly become prosperous and strong, and become a modern socialist country. To achieve this goal, we can only rely on the development of productive forces to solve it. (3) The real contradiction faced by China at present is still the contradiction between productive forces and production relations. This contradiction is mainly manifested in the many factors that hinder the development of productive forces in terms of production relations and superstructure, which are contradictory and conflicting with the requirements of productive forces development. The solution to this contradiction must first rely on the development of social productive forces. (4) Production relations must be in line with the nature of productive forces. According to this law, on the one hand, it is necessary to change backward production relations and open up the road for the development of productive forces, while also preventing the excessive counter-effects of production relations. If the production relations change too quickly and exceed the level of development of productive forces, it will hinder the development of productive forces and even destroy them.
On this issue, Deng Xiaoping also expressed his views. In October 1977, he said during a meeting with Canadian guests: "The Gang of Four" denies the importance of productive forces. Whoever proposes to develop productive forces will be accused of advocating the theory of productive forces. This is one of the major debates between us and the "Gang of Four". If the productive forces are not developed to a material abundance, how can we achieve distribution according to needs and how can we enter communism? There is no such term as "the theory of productive forces" in Marxism-Leninism, and this term is unscientific. In December, he said during a meeting with Australian guests: How can we reflect the superiority of socialism that Lenin talked about? What does superiority mean? Is not working, not studying considered superiority? Is it considered superiority for the people's living standards to not improve but regress? If this is considered the superiority of socialism, we can also do without such socialism.
In addition, the theoretical circles also conducted theoretical analysis on the prevalence of "leftist" errors during that era, when acting in accordance with economic laws was regarded as something in direct opposition to emphasizing politics. At that time, a representative article was the one drafted by Hu Qiaomu, Yu Guangyuan, and Ma Hong, titled "Acting in Accordance with Economic Laws and Accelerating the Realization of the Four Modernizations". This article was first delivered by Hu Qiaomu at a virtual meeting of the State Council, and was published in the People's Daily on October 6, 1977. The article discusses the following issues: economic laws are objective and not subject to people's will; although economic laws are objective, they do not automatically ensure that people act according to them, so it is necessary to study them and consciously abide by them; in order to act according to economic laws, it is necessary to first improve scientific management and expand the role of economic organizations and means. Specifically, this includes promoting contract systems, developing professional companies, strengthening the role of banks, and developing economic legislation and economic justice. These discussions hit the nail on the head and provide directional guidance for solving problems in real economic life. Some effective economic management methods have begun to be implemented, such as performance-based rewards and piece rate wages.
2. Reflection on the History of Literature and Art
After the defeat of the "Gang of Four" and the complete overthrow of the so-called "black line governance theory in literature and art," a large number of films, dramas, and other excellent works of literature and art that had been suppressed for a long time were liberated. Mass organizations such as the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers' Association resumed their work, and various forms of literary and artistic creation gradually became active. Soon, there emerged literary and artistic works that began to reflect and reexamine the trauma of the "Cultural Revolution". In the context of a decade of "cultural desert," it was far from enough to only restore the works that existed before the "Cultural Revolution" to meet the needs of society. Without new works that reflect the fate of ordinary people from a new perspective, it would still be difficult to change the situation of withered literary and artistic forms. In this period of transition, reportage literature, with its strong documentary nature, emerged first.
Reportage literature is a form that is closest to people's real lives. It can show readers the true state of existence and relevant events of protagonists that they are unfamiliar with but eager to understand. After the defeat of the "Gang of Four," signs of a "spring" were first released in the field of scientific education. Sensitive writers sensed the aroma of spring. In particular, the stories of Chinese scientists who, despite the decade-long catastrophe, remained steadfast in their commitment to scientific research at the cost of their lives, are very vivid and touching. Even without deliberate polishing, they are enough to deeply move people.
The first to pick up the pen was the older generation writer, Xu Chi, who recorded the life experiences of scientists who were buried by the fanatical and ignorant political atmosphere but were determined to revitalize China's technology industry in his works. He enthusiastically celebrated the scientists who willingly endured loneliness and made selfless contributions in difficult times. He wrote works such as "The Light of Geology," "The Goldbach Conjecture," and "The Evergreen Tree of Life". The emergence of these works injected vitality into the literary and artistic forms that had been devastated and distorted during the ten years of chaos, and they flourished.
The reportage article "The Goldbach Conjecture," published in the first issue of "People's Literature" in 1978, vividly portrayed the mathematician Chen Jingrun's persistent efforts and unwavering perseverance in tackling world-class mathematical problems, his sincere dedication to the country's scientific cause, and his valuable qualities of not succumbing to evil forces and being unaffected by temptations. It truly reproduced the feelings of the new generation of intellectuals in China, who were infatuated with scientific exploration. "People's Daily" unusually published this reportage literature in its entirety, occupying two whole pages, which is rare in the history of the newspaper.
Afterward, a batch of documentary works praising Chinese scientists emerged one after another. Through the profound historical perspective of the authors, readers got to know the names of leading figures in China's scientific and technological community as well as young and middle-aged research elites. They included geologist Li Siguang, biologist Tong Dizhou, quantum chemist Tang Aoqing, physicist Xie Xide, mathematician Chen Jingrun, botanist Cai Xitao, engineering physicist Wu Zhonghua, hydraulic engineer Zhang Guangdou, mathematician Hua Luogeng, science and technology icon Chen Zhen, and revolutionary model for cotton production Wu Jichang, etc. People marvel at this group of scientists, each with their own personality and common ideals. Despite the extremely weak material conditions and the impact and interference of the "left" political tendencies in the past decades, they have still achieved scientific accomplishments that are world-leading and have earned the respect of society. These works of reportage literature bring a strong impact and shock in terms of rationality, emotions, and values, igniting and fueling the fire of social rational thinking, and forming an unstoppable trend.
During this period, works in the form of literature began to emerge, revealing the trauma of the "Cultural Revolution" and were called "scar literature". In the 11th issue of "People's Literature" in 1977, a short story called "Class Teacher" by Beijing writer Liu Xinwu was published, which is considered the foundation of "scar literature". The author deliberately portrayed two typical middle school student figures in the story - small thug Song Baoqi and Youth League Committee secretary Xie Huimin. The mark of the "Cultural Revolution" seems to be completely different on the two students, but deep in their souls are indelible scars caused by extreme left-wing thinking. Among them, Xie Huimin's character is referred to as "the first artistic representative character in literature of the new era". Author Liu Xinwu said that writing this story was due to "deep-seated resentment accumulated during the 'Cultural Revolution', which concentrated on the strong dissatisfaction with the cultural authoritarianism of the 'Gang of Four'."
After the publication of the novel, it caused a strong response among readers. Works reflecting on the pain of the "Cultural Revolution" appeared in succession in newspapers and magazines. Among them, the representative one is the novel "Scar" published in "Wen Hui Bao" on August 1, 1978. This novel reveals the hardships and inner "injuries" caused by the ultra-left line and "bloodline theory" to Chinese society, especially to young people, through a tragic story. This highly stimulating theme directly touches upon the hidden pains of social reality, igniting people's thoughts on reflecting on the past and projecting into the future, and has a considerable influence nationwide.
The reason why the novel "Scar" caused a great response in society and resonated with a significant portion of people is mainly because it reveals the inexplicable pain in people's hearts at that time. Of course, there were diverse opinions on the themes and ideas reflected in this work, and the comments were divided. There were debates at symposiums held in Shanghai and Beijing. However, whether for or against it, this kind of literary work quickly formed a trend and was later collectively referred to as "scar literature". In fact, this phenomenon is the inevitable result of historical reflection that people went through after a major social upheaval in China. Although this reflection is still preliminary and superficial, it has prompted more people to engage in deep rational thinking about the mistakes of the prevailing "left-wing" ideology in the past.
This kind of historical reflection triggered by "scar literature" will become a lasting proposition for rational thinking in the transition from tradition to modernity: in the decades of China's development, the overall cultural situation has experienced a rupture. The distant cause was the May Fourth Movement, which fundamentally negated the grand unifying principles of pre-Qin thinkers. The recent cause was the "Cultural Revolution", which overturned the tradition of science and democracy since the May Fourth Movement. The consequence is that the humanistic spirit gradually nurtured in modern China has been sacrificed as a cost during this tumultuous era, and the core values passed down by the Chinese nation have been interrupted. After the interruption, it can be restored, but the wounds leave scars and cannot return to their original state. The problems of individuals, society, and ideological forms that emerged during the "Cultural Revolution" and unfolded in the following two to three decades slowly manifested themselves in various groups and classes, showing up everywhere due to various new reasons and old roots - this is the truly severe problem. With the return of the rationality of the entire social values and the development of the economy, society, and national strength to a certain extent after the reform and opening up, the focus will shift back to the "people" issue. The humanistic conditions of a civilized society are always unavoidable.
Literature played a leading role in promoting rational thinking in the ideological and cultural sphere at that time, while drama played a more unique role in stirring people's thoughts and emotions. In March 1978, the Beijing People's Art Theater staged the play "Heart Score" written by Su Shuyang. This was the first political-themed play performed by the theater after its restoration. The play depicted a thrilling struggle between medical workers represented by the old intellectual Fang Lingxuan and the minions of the "Gang of Four" as they developed a new drug to treat coronary heart disease, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai. It deeply exposed the great "internal injuries" caused by the Gang of Four's various retrogressive actions deep in people's hearts and fervently praised Fang Lingxuan's steadfast pursuit of scientific endeavors. It also strongly condemned the despicable actions of Feng Jisheng, a member of the "Gang of Four" who had sided with them. The performance of this play, as well as the performance of the four-act play "In the Silence" written by Zong Fuxian, a Shanghai worker, received rave reviews and tickets were in high demand.
As stated in a comment in the People's Daily at the time, these works "use the form of art to reverse the distorted history imposed by the 'Gang of Four', convey the words that billions of people want to say and express the strong emotions deep in the hearts of billions of people." The Chinese literary and artistic community's criticism and repudiation of the "Gang of Four" used various artistic forms and imagery, opening the door to historical reflection on the Cultural Revolution and effectively driving the wave of ideological liberation at the time.
3. The Great Debate on the Criteria of Truth
The discussion in the economic theory field and the historical reflection in the literature and art field played a leading role in breaking through the "forbidden area" and played a role in "piercing through the wall to let light in." However, it is still difficult to thoroughly clarify the right from wrong of the Cultural Revolution and its preceding period under the rigid shells of the "two whatever" stance. As Hu Yaobang said, since we have firmly and resolutely taken the first step forward, we must never retreat and strive to expand the breakthrough that has already been made. Therefore, criticism must be raised against the "two whatever" stance.
The older generation of Communist Party revolutionaries in China not only have noble political prestige but also have rich experience from long-term struggles. They first brought out their ideological weapon - seeking truth from facts.
On September 5, 1977, Nie Rongzhen published an article titled "Restoring and Carrying Forward the Fine Tradition of the Party's Style" in Issue 9 of the Red Flag magazine. Nie Rongzhen put forward that seeking truth from facts is the most precious theoretical legacy left to us by Mao Zedong. "To uphold the style of seeking truth from facts, we must adopt the correct attitude towards Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In our study and application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we must grasp their spiritual essence, learn their positions, views, and methods, take their basic principles as our guide for action, and resolutely oppose taking certain words and phrases of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as dogmas detached from time, place, and conditions." "All correct ideology is relative to time, place, and conditions; otherwise, it becomes metaphysics." "We must never forget to seek truth from facts, hold a dialectical perspective, and recognize that everything is determined by time, place, and conditions, otherwise, we would deviate from the most fundamental essence of Mao Zedong Thought."
On September 19th, Xu Xiangqian emphasized the importance of adhering to the principle of the Party's leadership in the article "Always Adhere to the Principle of the Party Commanding the Gun" by discussing the struggle between the Party and Zhang Guozhen and the "Gang of Four" on military issues. He pointed out: "We must not be like some people, regardless of whether the line is right or wrong, just follow whoever has the most power, which is very dangerous. Of course, identifying the correct line and the wrong line is not so easy." Therefore, it is necessary to "comprehensively and accurately understand and grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."
On September 28th, Chen Yun criticized the rampant idealism and metaphysical behavior of the "Gang of Four" during their reign in the article "Adhering to the Revolution Style of Seeking Truth from Facts". He pointed out that the "Gang of Four" and their followers told lies, fabricated false cases, played the role of counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals, which became a common occurrence. They severely distorted, fragmented, tampered with, and forged Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They used bits and pieces of words from classic Marxist authors as magic weapons to suppress and harm people, the Party, and the country. They severely undermined the fine traditions and style of our party that Chairman Mao had nurtured for a long time. They not only greatly undermined the party's style of seeking truth from facts but also openly created "theoretical" justifications for their subjective idealism. They advocated such slogans as "oppose empiricism", which actually negated the practical experience as the basis of knowledge, negated the correct principles based on practice, and negated Mao Zedong's thought of "On Practice", namely the thought of seeking truth from facts.
Chen Yun pointed out profoundly: "Seeking truth from facts is not an ordinary style issue; it is a fundamental ideological and theoretical issue of Marxist materialism. If we want to adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we must adhere to seeking truth from facts. If we depart from the revolutionary style of seeking truth from facts, we will depart from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and become idealists who are divorced from reality. Then our revolutionary work will be doomed to failure. Therefore, whether to adhere to the revolutionary style of seeking truth from facts is, in reality, one of the fundamental signs distinguishing true from false Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."
The older generation of revolutionaries emphasized the need to adhere to the fundamental ideological and theoretical line of seeking truth from facts and opposed the use of certain words or phrases from Mao Zedong Thought to fragment Mao Zedong Thought. In this regard, the "Two Whatevers" exactly aimed to uphold everything of Mao Zedong, including his erroneous theories and practices in his later years. In response to this difficult problem, in July 1977, after Deng Xiaoping returned to work at the Third Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee, he immediately proposed to accurately and comprehensively understand Mao Zedong Thought and to adhere to the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. He actively advocated the basic principle of seeking truth from facts, which is a fundamental viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, in order to guide people to treat Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong with the correct attitude.
However, at a time when personal worship of Mao Zedong still had a deep influence within the party just after Mao Zedong's passing, it was extremely difficult to achieve "completeness and accuracy". This requires an objective standard that puts everything and everyone under its purview. Otherwise, it would be impossible to break free from the shackles of the "Two Whatevers" and reestablish the guiding principles of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This would definitely affect the deepening of the rectification and hinder the reversal of the various works. Therefore, the issue of testing the standards of truth was raised.
At the end of 1977, more than eight hundred senior cadres studying at the Central Party School gathered to discuss the history of the Communist Party since the "Cultural Revolution". During the discussion, they encountered a prominent issue, which was what should be used as the standard to understand and determine the right and wrong of history. In response, Hu Yaobang, who was then the Vice President of the Central Party School and in charge of its executive work, instructed the school's theoretical researchers to make several revisions and wrote a document guiding the study of Party history. This document explicitly put forward two guiding principles: first, it should fully and accurately apply the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; second, it should use practice as the standard to test truth and discern right and wrong in line with the party's guiding principles. Under the guidance of these two principles, some theoretical researchers at the Party School began to prepare articles discussing the influence of the "Two Whatevers" and the issue of standards of truth.
In March 1978, in response to the confusion about the standard of truth, the editorial department of the People's Daily published a thought commentary titled "There is Only One Standard", explicitly stating that "the standard of truth is one, and that is social practice." After the article was published, it received opposition from some people who believed that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought were the standards for testing truth. In response, the editorial department decided to organize further articles to clarify this issue.
In early April, the Guangming Daily was preparing to publish a submission by Hu Fuming, a teacher in the Philosophy Department of Nanjing University, titled "Practice is the Only Standard for Testing Truth", as part of the "Philosophy Supplement" of the newspaper. Yang Xiguang, who had just returned from studying at the Central Party School, keenly felt the significance of the issue discussed in this article in the intellectual and political circles of China at that time. He decided to withdraw the article from the "Philosophy Supplement" and add some practical relevance before publishing it prominently on the front page. At this time, the author Hu Fuming came to Beijing to participate in a theoretical discussion meeting, so the newspaper invited him to discuss and revise the article together with the theoretical research office of the Central Party School. After the revision, the manuscript was further processed by the newspaper's editors twice before being sent back to the theoretical research office of the Central Party School for final modification and polishing.
After being personally reviewed and approved by Hu Yaobang, the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" was first published in the "Theory Trends" of the Central Party School on May 10, 1978. The next day, it was published as a special commentary article in the Guangming Daily. On the 12th, the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily reprinted the full text, and Xinhua News Agency also issued a press release. Many provincial and municipal party newspapers subsequently reprinted the article.
This article, which condensed the collective wisdom of the theoretical world at that time, explained with a large number of facts that practice is not only the criterion for testing truth but also the sole criterion. Any theory must undergo continuous tests of practice. The reason Marxism is recognized as the truth lies in the results confirmed by the practice of millions of people. The dialectical materialist epistemology's view of the absolute and relative dialectical unity of the criterion of practice holds that any thought or theory must unconditionally, forever, and continuously accept the test of practice. This is also the view of the development of truth. The revolutionary mentors have already set an example for us in the practice of testing truth.
In connection with the situation in the ideological and political field at that time, the article emphasized that although the Gang of Four and their network had been destroyed, the spiritual shackles imposed by the Gang of Four on people were far from completely shattered. The tendency that Mao Zedong criticized that "only what is included in the Bible is correct" still existed. Whether in theory or practical work, the Gang of Four set up many "forbidden zones" that imprisoned people's thinking. We must dare to touch these "forbidden zones" and dare to clarify right and wrong. There are no forbidden zones in science. Wherever there are "forbidden zones" that go beyond practice and regard themselves as absolute, there is no science, no real Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, only obscurantism, idealism, and cultural authoritarianism.
The article concludes: Socialism is still a kingdom that has many areas that are unknown to us. In order to accomplish this great task, we face many new problems that need us to understand and study. Lying on the ready-made provisions of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, and even using ready-made formulas to restrict, truncate, and cut the rapidly developing revolutionary practice is a mistaken attitude. We should have the responsibility and courage of Communists, daring to study dynamic real-life, study the exact facts of reality, and study new problems raised in new practices. Only in this way can we have the correct attitude towards Marxism and gradually move forward from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom, smoothly embarking on a new and great Long March.
In fact, the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" repeatedly argues for a commonsensical philosophical proposition of Marxism, and does not have any particularly innovative theoretical ideas. However, in the specific historical conditions where the "Cultural Revolution" has just ended and the "Two Whatevers" still restrict people's thoughts, its distinct tendency and strong directionality have infinite power. After the article was published, it immediately elicited different reactions from all sectors of society, causing a stir within and outside the party. The nationwide debate on the issue of the standard for truth thus begins.
On May 12th, the same day when the People's Daily reprinted the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth", a person in charge of the newspaper received a phone call accusing the article of "making directional mistakes".
On May 17th, Wang Dongxing, who was then Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, specifically criticized the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" and the article published by the People's Daily on May 5th titled "Implementing the Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Work" in a small meeting. He said that they had not read these two articles, causing discussions inside and outside the party. In fact, the criticism was aimed at Chairman Mao's thoughts. Our party's newspaper shouldn't do this. He questioned, "Whose opinion is this from the central government?" and expressed that "it should be investigated, lessons should be learned, a unified understanding should be reached, and it should not happen again." He also demanded that the Central Propaganda Department "censor carefully".
On May 18th, during the National Education Work Conference held by the Central Propaganda Department and the symposium with provincial and municipal education secretaries and propaganda department ministers, Zhang Pinghua, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, asked everyone to "discuss and express different opinions" about the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth". He said, "Don't think that once the People's Daily publishes it and Xinhua News Agency releases it, it becomes a settled matter." Chairman Mao said to responsible comrades of provinces and municipalities before his death that no matter where things come from, including those from the central government, they should be sniffed with a nose to see if they are fragrant or foul, and not follow the wind.
On June 15th, Wang Dongxing convened a meeting with the leaders of the Central Propaganda Department, central authorities, and relevant news units. At the meeting, he criticized the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" and several other articles again, and mentioned Hu Yaobang, reminding him to pay attention when writing articles in the newspaper. He particularly emphasized that special commentator articles should be noted, as some of them are not so appropriate. Don't seek momentary popularity. He believed that deficiencies in propaganda would be exploited by domestic and foreign enemies, both the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as reactionaries. They would incite relations between members of the Political Bureau, incite relations between Central Committee members, incite relations between Chairman Mao and Chairman Hua, and incite relations between workers and farmers. If the grip on propaganda is loose, it would be a serious matter to be exploited by the enemy.
In July, leading comrades in charge of propaganda work from the central government visited Shandong for inspection. They spoke to comrades in charge of the Shandong Provincial Committee in Jinan and mentioned the issue of the standard for truth. In summary, there are three main points: firstly, do not cut the flag; secondly, do not throw knives; thirdly, do not make a 180-degree turn.
In this political situation, many newspapers have actively participated, but the magazine "Red Flag" has remained silent for a long time. Of course, silence is also a form of expression. When the head of the magazine reflected on the criticism of "Red Flag" by the party members and the masses, Wang Dongxing said, "Don't be afraid of isolation, what are you afraid of! Don't be afraid. "Red Flag" will not participate in this discussion."
At a time when the discussion on the standard of truth was suppressed and faced a heavy burden, veteran revolutionaries like Deng Xiaoping stood up clearly to provide strong support. On May 30th, during a conversation with several officials, Deng Xiaoping pointedly said, "If what you say is different from what Chairman Mao said, then it's not acceptable. If Chairman Mao didn't say it, and Chairman Hua didn't say it, then it's not acceptable for you to say it. You have to copy everything Chairman Mao said, everything Chairman Hua said, word for word. This is not an isolated phenomenon, it is a reflection of a current trend of thought." He emphasized, "The most fundamental and important thing about Mao Zedong Thought is seeking truth from facts. Now, even the criterion of practice being the test of truth has become a problem, it's simply absurd."
On June 2nd, during the Political Work Conference of the entire army, Deng Xiaoping once again spoke on this issue and criticized, "We also have comrades who talk about Mao Zedong Thought every day, but often forget, abandon, or even oppose Mao Zedong's insistence on seeking truth from facts, starting from reality, and combining theory with practice, which are basic Marxist viewpoints and methods. Not only that, some people think that whoever insists on seeking truth from facts, starting from reality, and combining theory with practice is committing a heinous crime. In essence, their point of view is that as long as you copy the original words of Marx, Lenin, and Comrade Mao Zedong, it's enough. Otherwise, they will say that you are violating Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the spirit of the central party. This problem they raise is not a minor one, but involves how to view Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought."
On July 21st, Deng Xiaoping specifically spoke with the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Zhang Pinghua, requesting him, "Do not issue bans or set forbidden zones anymore, do not push the lively political atmosphere we just started backward."
On August 19th, during a conversation with the head of the Ministry of Culture, Deng Xiaoping said again, "I have said that the article 'Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth' is Marxist, and it cannot be refuted. I agree with the viewpoint in this article."
On September 16th, when listening to the work report from the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, Deng Xiaoping directly said, "Now, many people inside and outside the party, at home and abroad, support holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. What does it mean to hold high? How to hold high? As we all know, there is a kind of discussion called 'the Two Entirely Different Standpoints.' Isn't it well-known? It means that no document read by Comrade Mao Zedong can be altered, and nothing done or said by Comrade Mao Zedong can be changed. Is this what it means to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought? No! If we continue in this way, it will harm Mao Zedong Thought. " The basic point of Mao Zedong Thought is seeking truth from facts, that is, combining the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution."
On September 9th, in his speech at the State Council's virtual meeting, Li Xiannian also expressed support for the discussion on the criterion of truth. He said that the destruction caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" has confused many theoretical issues, including the relationship between theory and practice, causing ideological confusion that must be clarified. He emphasized that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, pointing out that anything that has been proven in long-term social practice to conform to objective laws and to benefit the majority of people must be resolutely pursued and carried through. All of our policies, plans, and measures should be tested against the standard of whether they can benefit the people.
To commemorate the 85th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth, the Red Flag magazine invited Tan Zhenlin to write an article reminiscing about Mao Zedong's leadership in the struggle at Jinggangshan. After the article was written, the editors found that besides recalling history, the article also discussed the criterion of truth being tested through practice. This obviously contradicted the "non-involvement" attitude of the Red Flag magazine, and the author was unwilling to make any changes. Therefore, it had to be submitted to the Central Committee for a decision. Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, and others agreed to publish this article in the Red Flag magazine.
Deng Xiaoping and Li Xiannian also criticized the Red Flag magazine in their annotations. Deng Xiaoping wrote, "I think this article is good, at least there are no mistakes." "If the Red Flag magazine is unwilling to publish it, it can be published in the People's Daily. Why doesn't the Red Flag magazine involve itself? It should involve itself. Articles with different viewpoints can be published. It seems that not involving oneself may actually be involving oneself." Li Xiannian commented, "I have read this article. Comrade Tan Zhenlin talked about historical facts, so it should be published. It's too passive for the Red Flag magazine to not publish it. The Red Flag magazine is already quite passive."
When the discussion among the top leaders of the central government further intensified the struggle against the "whatever-ism" camp concerning the criterion of truth, the academic, scholarly, and journalistic communities also took action. Encouraged by the support and concern of the older generation of revolutionaries, they resisted various pressures from the "whatever-ism" camp and continued to write articles and hold discussions in order to further deepen the ongoing debate.
Regarding the criterion that practice is the test of truth, the majority of people expressed support, but some questioned whether practice is the "sole criterion." They believed that while practice is indeed the criterion of truth, Marxism should also serve as the criterion of truth. This was a problem of ideological understanding that had some universality at the time. In response to this situation, Xing Bensi from the Philosophy Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published an article titled "On the Criterion of Truth," in which he specifically addressed the aforementioned question. The article argued that advocating both practice and Marxism as the criteria of truth violated the unity of dialectical materialism and would lead to theoretical confusion. In terms of understanding, this confuses the concept of truth with the criterion of truth. Marxism is a truth, but just like any truth cannot prove itself, Marxism also cannot prove itself on its own, it also needs to be proven by practice. At the same time, Marxism cannot be used as a standard to test other truths. Another confusion is to confuse Marxism as a pointer to revolutionary practice with Marxism as the standard of truth. These are two different issues. Philosophically speaking, while acknowledging the counteractive effect of theoretical knowledge on practice, we cannot deny the fundamental determining role of practice and replace it with this counteractive effect as the question of testing truth.
Faced with various criticisms that practice is the only criterion to test the truth, theoretical workers have provided persuasive answers and refutations. One of the most systematic, sharp, and vigorous responses was an article published on June 24th in the Liberation Army Daily under the name of a special commentator titled "One Most Basic Principle of Marxism". The article clearly pointed out: "The most powerful refutation of skepticism, agnosticism, and other philosophical absurdities is practice. This is a well-known phrase Engels used to criticize Hume's and Kant's agnosticism and skepticism, and it is still meaningful for us to cite it today." "The epistemology of Marxism recognizes practice as the true authority. It is precisely because the objective criteria (practice) for discerning truth have not been established in the world that skepticism and agnosticism have gained popularity. It is never because the objective criteria for discerning truth have been established that skepticism and agnosticism have become popular. Those who hold the opposite view are astonishingly 'reversed'!"
In response to this inverted relationship, the article pointed out sharply: "Marxist theory is a science, not superstition; theory must first be subordinate to practice in order to guide practice; theory is not eternal, but constantly supplemented, corrected, enriched, and developed in practice." Therefore, we cannot stick to old conclusions and slogans, of course, changing these old slogans is not easy. "The reason is that, in addition to the fact that people's thinking often lags behind reality, it is also because some people's interests are more or less connected with these old slogans. These people, who claim to be worried that the modification of certain old slogans and formulations will lead to the negation of the entire revolution and theory (obviously, this is nothing but a whimsical rhetoric), are actually afraid that their personal interests will be harmed as a result." In response to the criticisms of some people, for example: If we prioritize practice as the only criterion for testing the truth, then where does Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's words fit in? The article pointed out: For those who speak such confused words, just ask them back: Chairman Mao said that only the revolutionary practice of millions of people is the criterion for testing truth, "there is no other way to test truth besides this." Where do you place Chairman Mao's guidance? How should we act according to Chairman Mao's guidance?
This article, which is more than 10,000 words long, is fully reasoned and highly targeted. It is known as the sister article of "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth". It was published with the concern and support of Luo Ruiqing, the Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission. After the article was completed, the Liberation Army Daily sent it to Luo Ruiqing for review. Luo Ruiqing read it carefully three times, made five phone calls personally, and personally looked up related works, and made many suggestions for revision, requesting that the article be flawless. This general, who was persecuted and had his leg broken during the Cultural Revolution and had a high-level amputation before going to West Germany for leg treatment, even called Hu Jiwei, the person in charge of the People's Daily, before going to Germany and said, "If this article is going to be attacked, I am willing to take 50 big slaps first." This spirit of willingly taking risks demonstrates Luo Ruiqing's clear attitude in supporting the discussion on the standard of truth, which he never had the chance to stand up for again after his treatment in the West German hospital.
The standard of practice as the criterion for testing truth is a self-evident and non-debatable issue in the field of natural science. However, natural scientists are still actively engaging in this discussion. In mid-May, the Joint Meeting of the State Science and Technology Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Communist Party Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology, chaired by Fang Yi, was held to discuss relevant articles and made a decision to support this discussion. On July 5th, the "Seminar on the Relationship between Theory and Practice" organized by the Theoretical Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Society for Dialectical Materialism was held in Beijing. Many scholars from the natural sciences and social sciences participated in the discussion and made speeches. Scientists used a large number of examples from the history of natural sciences to illustrate that when the original theory of natural science conflicts with new scientific experimental facts, the breakthrough of the old theory and the establishment of the new theory must seek practical support at the same time. The arguments they provided in the field of natural sciences played a special supportive role in this ideological and political discussion.
From July 17th to 24th, the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the editorial department of "Philosophical Research" invited more than 160 theoretical workers from central and state departments, party schools, colleges and universities, scientific research institutions, and news units at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels to hold a discussion on the relationship between theory and practice. Many social science workers made speeches at the conference, connecting with reality and fully affirming the practical significance of this discussion. After the conference, many representatives from provinces and cities went back and conveyed the discussion on the issue of truth standards, pushing the discussion on truth standards to the whole country.
In the second half of 1978, the theoretical, academic, literary, and journalistic circles nationwide actively engaged in the discussion on the issue of truth standards. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of the year, more than 650 articles on the discussion of truth standards had been published in central and provincial newspapers and magazines. As the discussion continued, more articles were published. A nationwide discussion frenzy, led by the theoretical circle and affecting all sectors of society, attracted everyone's attention.
In this discussion frenzy, one phenomenon is noteworthy, that is, along with the discussion on truth standards, most of the provincial party and government leadership organizations and major military region leadership institutions nationwide launched discussions on truth standards. Many provincial, autonomous region, direct-controlled city, and major military region leaders openly wrote articles or gave speeches, expressing their support for the view that practice is the sole criterion for testing the truth and highly evaluating the theoretical significance and practical significance of this discussion. This is rare in the history of the Party and the Republic. Their speeches generally connected with the actual situation at the time, not only pointing out the theoretical significance of this discussion but also emphasizing its political significance. This at least indicates that the discussion on the issue of truth standards has indeed become a major political issue of utmost concern to the whole Party, the entire army and the people of the whole country, and it shows that the correct view that practice is the sole criterion for testing the truth has gained stronger support from more and more senior cadres. Power standards, ignorance, idealism, and cultural authoritarianism are increasingly losing ground.
The discussion on the issue of truth standards, by restoring the role of practice as the criterion for testing truth standards, not only provided people with sharp ideological weapons to break away from the confinement of the "two whatevers", but also provided a theoretical basis for correctly summarizing the lessons of the "Cultural Revolution" and correcting historical errors during the "Cultural Revolution" and in the past. As pointed out in the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth", the only places that consider themselves as absolute "forbidden zones" are ignorance, idealism, and cultural authoritarianism. The discussion on the issue of truth standards has greatly promoted people's ideological liberation, accelerated the pace of rectification, fully prepared for the Communist Party of China to break away from the ideological confinement of the "two whatevers", re-establish the guiding principle of seeking truth from facts, and achieve a great historical turning point.
More importantly, this movement, later known as a great ideological liberation in the history of modern Chinese thought, laid the foundation for the exploration of the socialist path with Chinese characteristics after the reform and opening up, as well as a series of theoretical innovations and development in practice.
III. Local brewing of the issue of the shift in the focus of Party and state work
The discussion on the problem of standards of truth has brought about intellectual liberation and promoted the new exploration of the Chinese Communist Party on the socialist path of China. This new exploration, due to the end of the "Cultural Revolution" and the rapid increase in China's foreign exchanges, has gained a broader vision. China has started to learn from and draw on the experiences of different types of countries' economic development in the world, gradually clarifying its basic policy of opening up to the outside world.
1. The extensive visits of Chinese leaders and the emergence of awareness of reform and opening up
Since 1978, China has changed the situation of very few visits by party and government leaders during the "Cultural Revolution" period. In that year, 13 vice premiers and vice chairpersons of the National People's Congress visited 21 times to 51 countries. Among them, Deng Xiaoping himself visited 8 countries 4 times. These visits not only improved our country's foreign relations but also provided the top party and state leaders with a more direct and comprehensive understanding of the development and changes in the international situation in recent years. One common strong feeling among the visiting leaders was that our country was far behind the world's advanced level in terms of economic and scientific and technological development.
In March 1978, at the National Science Conference, some comrades talked about the closer relationship between the development of the world economy and science and technology. The development of the national economy and various industries mainly relied on the development of science and technology. An important reason for our country's economic backwardness was the backwardness of science and technology. Compared with the world's advanced level, our country's science and technology lagged behind by about 15 to 20 years in most fields, and even more in some fields. Therefore, if we want to improve our economy, we must first honestly learn advanced technology from the world. If we close our ears and eyes, without understanding the trends, tendencies, and levels of scientific and technological development internationally, there is no way to talk about catching up with the world's advanced level. These opinions attracted the attention of the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
On May 17, 1978, the State Council established a leading group for the introduction of new technologies, responsible for studying and formulating plans to introduce advanced technologies from abroad. Subsequently, the leaders of the State Council, various departments, and local officials successively visited and investigated Western developed countries and regions to understand their level of economic development and the experience of developing their economies. Before Gu Mu, the Vice Premier of the State Council, led a delegation to visit Western Europe, Deng Xiaoping specifically requested them to conduct detailed investigations and research to see to what level modern industry had developed and how they managed their economic work, as well as to bring back the advanced experience of capitalism.
When Chinese leaders stepped out of the country, capitalism had already gone through a "golden age" of great development after World War II. In the first half of the 1970s, capitalist countries successively encountered the most serious economic crises since the post-war period. In the two years of 1974 and 1975, the gross domestic product of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, and Italy all experienced negative growth. In the second half of the 1970s, the Western economies were in a state of "stagflation" and had weak recovery. In this situation, not only were developed countries willing to expand trade with China, but they were also willing to provide preferential loans to China and even make investments.
Through visits and investigations, these leading comrades not only saw the gap in our country's level of economic development but also saw the favorable opportunities provided by the international situation at that time for our development. After returning to the country, they all suggested to the central government: we should fully utilize the current favorable conditions, absorb foreign capital as much as possible, introduce a large amount of advanced technology and equipment from abroad, learn from their advanced management experience, and accelerate the modernization of our country. When Gu Mu reported on the visit to the Central Committee and the State Council, he specifically mentioned: when Western Europe took off economically, they all had the experience of using foreign capital and introducing advanced technology, why can't we do the same? The opinions and suggestions raised by the comrades mentioned above were organized into documents, circulated among the leaders of various departments in the central and state organs, and aroused strong reactions.
2. The convening of the State Council's brainstorming session and the proposal for reform
Understanding the world's advanced level raised people's reflections on the experiences and lessons of our country's economic construction. How to summarize the experience and accelerate the pace of construction has become an increasingly prominent issue before the whole party.
During this period, Deng Xiaoping mentioned many times: we now have relatively good international conditions that we can take advantage of. We should take the world's advanced achievements as the starting point for our development. In the past, the Gang of Four hindered us from understanding what the world was like by isolating ourselves and focusing only on construction. The world economy is developing so fast, but our minds are still filled with outdated ideas. We need to ask and solve problems based on the current realities. Talking about the Four Modernizations every day will be empty if we don't compare ourselves with the world's advanced level. Not only are we technologically backward, but our management level is also low. Our country's system, including the institutional system, is basically learned from the Soviet Union and is outdated. There is duplication of personnel, overlapping of institutions, and the development of bureaucratism. Many institutional issues need to be reconsidered. These views gradually became the consensus among the leadership within the party.
From July 6 to September 9, 1978, the State Council held a two-month brainstorming session to specifically study how to accelerate the pace of modernization in our country. Department heads attending the meeting proposed ideas to speed up construction and, based on a careful summary of the experiences and lessons since the establishment of New China, put forward suggestions to reform the economic management system and actively introduce advanced foreign technology and equipment.
Several leaders who returned from foreign visits introduced the current international situation and the experiences of economic development abroad. The State Planning Commission proposed actively expanding exports and increasing foreign trade ports. The Ministry of Machinery Industry proposed combining the introduction of new technology with the reform of domestic management systems. The State Labor Service Administration proposed reforming the wage system and mobilizing the enthusiasm of workers. Hu Qiaomu listed the shortcomings of relying solely on administrative methods to manage the economy in his speech and proposed that this method "should be limited to the necessary scope, and the majority of economic work should be transferred from government administration to enterprise management. Enterprises themselves should also minimize pure administrative management and expand the use of economic means for management."
In the summary speech of the meeting, Li Xiannian clearly proposed the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy. He pointed out based on historical experience: in the past 20-odd years, we have reformed the economic system more than once, "but when it comes to enterprise management systems, we often focus too much on transferring administrative power, and we often circulate in the old patterns of loosening and tightening, thus failing to meet the requirements of economic development." "This reform we are now carrying out must take into account the initiative of central departments, localities, and enterprises, and must consider the economic interests and development prospects of large enterprises and major professional companies, and strive to manage the modern economy with modern management methods." He pointed out that the current international situation is very favorable to our country, and we should have the courage and ability to use foreign advanced technology, equipment, capital, and organizational experience to accelerate our construction. We must not miss this very rare opportunity. This will speed up progress by countless times compared to starting from scratch on our own.
On September 30, the Central Committee forwarded this speech and prepared to further discuss it at the upcoming Central Working Conference.
Shortly after this virtual meeting, the State Council convened a national planning conference, which proposed that three transformations must be implemented on the economic front: first, the attention must be focused on the struggle for production and technological revolution from top to bottom; second, the bureaucratic management system and methods that do not consider economic efficiency or work efficiency must be transformed into scientific management that follows economic laws and combines democracy and centralization effectively; third, the closed or semi-closed state of economic and technological exchange with different capitalist countries must be transformed into actively introducing advanced foreign technology, utilizing foreign capital, and boldly entering the international market.
On October 11th, in his speech at the 9th National Congress of Trade Unions, Deng Xiaoping said, "Achieving the four modernizations is a fundamental change in China's backward economic and technological appearance and further consolidates the great revolution of proletarian dictatorship. This revolution not only needs to significantly change the current backward productive forces but also must change the productive relations, the superstructure, the management methods of industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the state's management methods towards industrial and agricultural enterprises to meet the needs of modern large-scale economic development." Therefore, "each economic front not only needs major technological reforms but also needs major institutional and organizational reforms. Undertaking these reforms is in the long-term interests of the people of the whole country. Otherwise, we cannot get rid of the current backward state of production technology and management."
Under the promotion of the above-mentioned ideas, in 1978, China signed contracts for 22 complete sets of imported projects with Western developed countries one after another. Although there were tendencies to seek immediate success in the import work, these imported projects provided relatively advanced technological equipment and a higher starting point for China's modernization construction. For example, the introduction of complete equipment for the Baoshan Iron and Steel Plant in Shanghai enabled us to learn world-class production technology and management methods, and it also shortened the gap between our steel industry and the world's advanced level by at least 20 years. Both ideological brewing and practical attempts have indicated that the general principle of reform and opening up is about to emerge.
3. The brewing and proposal of the shift in the focus of Party and state work
The brewing of the idea of shifting the focus of Party and state work among the top leaders of the Party has been quite early. For instance, as early as 10 days after the "Gang of Four" was overthrown, Li Xiannian called Chen Yun on October 16, 1976, to seek his opinions on future work. After discussing with Wang Zhen and Yao Yilin, Chen Yun put forward several suggestions. One of them was to "vigorously promote production to enable the national economy to recover and develop rapidly." This is the earliest material discovered so far regarding the brewing of the shift in work focus.
In September 1978, after concluding his visit to North Korea, Deng Xiaoping made an unusual inspection tour of the three northeastern provinces, as well as Tangshan, Tianjin, and other places. This was an important effort made by Deng Xiaoping to promote historical changes.
During the inspection tour, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly called on responsible comrades in various places to emancipate their minds and seek truth from facts. They should dare to think, raise questions, and solve problems based on current international and domestic conditions. They must not create forbidden areas. The harm of forbidden areas is that they make people's thinking rigid and prevent them from considering problems based on their own conditions. In short, seek truth from facts, use your brain, and let a revolution happen. After introducing advanced technology and equipment, one must manage according to internationally advanced management methods and in accordance with economic laws. To revolutionize, not to reform, not to patch up. We should advocate and educate all cadres to think independently, and boldly reform things that are unreasonable. Currently, our superstructure needs to be changed.
He also emphasized repeatedly that the most urgent task facing China now is the development of productive forces. We are too poor, too backward, and truthfully, we are sorry for the people. We are a socialist country, and the fundamental manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system is that it allows the social productive forces to develop rapidly at a speed that the old society did not have, and continuously satisfy the growing material and cultural needs of the people. According to the viewpoint of historical materialism, the achievements of correct political leadership ultimately need to be demonstrated in the development of social productive forces and the improvement of the people's material and cultural lives. We need to think about how much we have done for the people. Therefore, we must now accelerate the development of productive forces and improve the people's material and cultural lives.
For this reason, Deng Xiaoping proposed to timely end the mass movement of exposing and criticizing the "Gang of Four" and shift the focus of the party and the country's work to socialist modernization construction. This is a thought of major strategic significance. When listening to the report on the situation of the movement to expose and criticize the "Gang of Four" by the the Communist Party of China Shenyang Military Region Party Committee Standing Committee, he said: When it comes to carrying out movements, you can study, what is the bottom? There is never anything completely thorough. Movements should not last too long, otherwise people will get tired. There must always be a bottom to the movement of exposing and criticizing the "Gang of Four". It can't be carried out for another three or five years. When it is almost completed, it can be ended and normal work can be resumed. After leaving the northeast, he reiterated this opinion to relevant comrades in the central government and received the support of other leading comrades in the central government. In this way, the possibility of shifting the focus of work is ready to become a major decision of the overall situation.
On October 11, in his speech at the 9th National Congress of Trade Unions, Deng Xiaoping made this opinion more explicit. He stated that the struggle to expose and criticize the "Gang of Four" has already achieved a decisive victory nationwide, and "we have been able to start new battle tasks on the basis of this victory". Now the Party Central Committee and the State Council require accelerating the pace of realizing the Four Modernizations, "this is a revolutionary change that fundamentally changes the backward economic and technological situation of our country and further consolidates the great revolution of proletarian dictatorship". He hoped that the delegates present would "have in-depth discussions on the current situation, in order to unite all members and fight for this great task on the basis of the complete victory in the struggle to expose and criticize the 'Gang of Four'".
At this time, quite a few people had already realized that in order to achieve the goal of socialist modernization and quickly implement the brewing reform and opening up, it was necessary to shift the focus of the party and the country's work to modernization construction. There was basically no disagreement within the party on this point. However, in terms of the guiding ideology of modernization construction, there was still no consensus within the party. Some comrades still adhered to the guiding ideology of "two musts" and believed that to achieve the Four Modernizations, "we must uphold class struggle as the key link and concurrently promote the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, struggle for production, and scientific experiment". Most comrades advocated that in order to carry out modernization construction, it is necessary to adhere to the guiding ideology of seeking truth from facts and first carry out rectification of chaos. This ideological disagreement has inevitably sparked a fierce clash of ideas over the issue of shifting work priorities.
IV. The 1978 Central Work Conference and the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee
From the convening of the 1978 Central Work Conference to the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, these two conferences had a significant impact on the Party and the country in the process of moving towards a great historical turning point after the overthrow of the "Gang of Four". With the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee as a symbol, the Party and the country embarked on a new journey of reform and opening up.
1. The convening of the 1978 Central Work Conference
On November 10, 1978, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a work conference in Beijing. The conference was attended by the main responsible comrades of the provinces, cities, autonomous regions, major military regions, and central departments, as well as some veteran comrades who had previously held important positions in the central, local, and military. A total of 219 people attended the conference. The participants were divided into six large groups according to regions. This was an extremely important central conference in preparation for the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.
At the opening ceremony, Hua Guofeng announced: The agenda of this conference is, firstly, to discuss the "Decision on Accelerating the Development Speed of Agriculture" and the "Regulations on Rural People's Communes (Trial Draft)"; secondly, to make arrangements for the national economic plans of 1979 and 1980; thirdly, to discuss Li Xiannian's speech at the State Council's virtual meeting. Before discussing these topics, the Politburo of the Central Committee decided to first discuss the issue of shifting the Party's work emphasis to the construction of socialist modernization starting from next year.
In his speech, Hua Guofeng did not mention the discussion of the standard of truth, the shift in guiding ideology, or the issue of rectifying miscarriages of justice, which were widely concerned by both the Party members and the public at that time. He said that the basis for shifting work emphasis was that the mass movement of criticizing and repudiating the "Gang of Four" on a large scale could be concluded with victory, and new tasks should be proposed in response to the development of the situation. "When the main problem of a stage is solved, it should move on to a new stage." This means that the shift in work emphasis is only a change in the stage of work, and not a fundamental change in guiding ideology and the Party's political line. Influenced by this, the documents submitted to the conference for discussion on agricultural issues still followed the thinking of "emphasizing revolution and promoting production" and the overall estimation of "continuous bumper harvests for more than a decade" promoted during the "Cultural Revolution", which concealed the truth. It is obvious that this way of achieving the shift in work emphasis is not satisfactory to those comrades attending the conference who were most concerned about resolving issues of guiding ideology and major historical problems.
Starting from the group discussions on November 11th, some raised the issue of rectifying major miscarriages of justice, such as the "Tiananmen Incident". On the 12th, Chen Yun made a speech in the Northeast Group and put forward his opinion on the need to first address the issue of historical legacy. He said: Achieving the four modernizations is the urgent desire of the whole Party and the entire people of our country, and stability and unity are also matters of concern to the whole Party and the entire people. In order to ensure stability and unity, "for some legacy issues that have a significant impact or a wide scope, the central authorities need to consider and make decisions". He then raised six major historical legacy issues, including the rehabilitation of Bo Yibo and 60 other individuals, the rehabilitation of the "Tiananmen Incident", and conclusions regarding Tao Zhu, Peng Dehuai, and others. Once these major issues of concern inside and outside the Party were raised, a strong response was aroused, and the atmosphere of the conference became lively. The focus of each group's speeches quickly turned to the issue of redressing wrongful cases, especially the "Tiananmen incident," with nearly all groups suggesting that it be redressed as soon as possible.
In this situation, the central government approved the announcement of the redress of the "Tiananmen incident" at an expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC. All comrades who had been persecuted as a result were to be redressed and their reputations restored. On the 15th, Xinhua News Agency reported on this with the headline "The 'Tiananmen Incident' was an entirely revolutionary action." On the 16th, newspapers such as People's Daily and Guangming Daily published this news, which greatly encouraged the masses and cadres. Subsequently, the provincial committees of Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and others solemnly announced that comrades who were persecuted during the Qingming Festival in 1976 for mourning Premier Zhou and opposing the "Gang of Four" would be thoroughly redressed and their reputations restored.
Regarding the redress of other major wrongful cases raised at the meeting, some comrades pointed out that these were all previously decided by the central government and it was necessary for the central government to come out and clearly explain it. Otherwise, there would be opposition from the cadres and masses. It would be best if the central government could clarify these issues before the shift in work focus.
In this situation, the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee discussed the opinions mentioned above. On November 25th, Hua Guofeng, on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, announced at the meeting that the central government had decided to publicly and thoroughly redress the "Tiananmen incident" and the significant wrongful cases of the so-called "February counterflow" and the "61-person traitor group led by Bo Yibo." The central government would correct the previous erroneous handling of comrades such as Peng Dehuai, Tao Zhu, and Yang Shangkun. All major local incidents would be handled by the party committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government based on the situation in a practical and objective manner. The central task force would conclude its work and transfer all cases to the Central Organization Department. People felt great anger towards Kang Sheng and Xie Fuzhi, so they demanded their exposure and criticism, among other things. Later, on December 14th, when the central work conference distributed Huo Guofeng's speech, it added the withdrawal of all central documents related to the "counter rightist wind" as a recognition of the error. These decisions essentially resolved several major issues that had been strongly called for by cadres and the masses for the past two years, and the comrades at the meeting immediately felt relieved. Everyone spoke their minds freely and felt more intellectually liberated. Some comrades even suggested that the "Cultural Revolution" should be reevaluated and reevaluated. They believed that there was no such thing as "Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois headquarters," and the evaluation of the "Cultural Revolution" as having achieved "70% success and 30% error" was not convincing. However, the time was not yet ripe for full discussion and clear resolution of this issue.
After resolving some major historical legacy issues, the meeting heatedly discussed the differences of opinion that had arisen in the debate on the criterion of truth. Some comrades still believed that discussing the criterion of truth actually amounted to "advocating doubt about everything" and was leading people to criticize Chairman Mao's mistakes, which did not conform to the guidelines of the 11th Party Congress. This view was criticized by the majority of comrades. Many comrades also criticized the negative attitudes displayed by the magazine "Hongqi" and the responsible persons from the Central Propaganda Department during the previous discussions and hoped they would quickly rectify their attitudes. Everyone felt that the essence of the division on this issue was a division between two different guiding ideologies. If this problem was not resolved and if right from wrong was not clarified, the shift in work focus would not proceed smoothly. After intense ideological struggle, some comrades who had lacked a proper understanding of the significance of this debate experienced a transformation and engaged in self-criticism. Everyone also requested that the Central Committee of the Party clearly state its position on this debate in order to thoroughly resolve the ideological line problem.
During the discussion of other topics, everyone also freed themselves from the constraints of the "Two Whatevers" and carried forward the tradition of seeking truth from facts, carefully reflecting on the guiding ideologies and some policy guidelines of the past years, and boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions.
What ideology should guide the shift of work priorities, this is a very crucial question. Some comrades believe that "while we are engaged in construction, we still must adhere to the principle of class struggle". However, many comrades pointed out that the issue of class struggle during the construction period should be reconsidered, and vague concepts should be clarified. This is a problem that the Party must solve in guiding modernization. Some comrades pointed out that the shift of work priorities is not a change in the usual nature of the Party's specific work, but a fundamental change of historical significance. In the future, unless war occurs, production struggle and technological revolution must be the center and there cannot be any other centers. Some comrades also questioned the formulation of "simultaneously seizing the three major revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment", which has been used for many years, believing that this formulation is not clear about priorities, and in the future, the focus should be explicitly on production struggle. After a heated discussion, the majority of people believe that the issue of class struggle during the socialist period should be reconsidered, thus paving the way for the negation of the principle of "class struggle as the guiding principle".
During the discussion of the two agricultural documents, many comrades expressed strong dissatisfaction with the avoidance of the harsh reality in the documents and the empty talk of the "superiority of the people's commune" and "continuous years of abundant harvests". They pointed out that there are nearly 200 million people in the country now, with food consumption per capita below 150 kilograms, unable to eat their fill, and the per capita grain production in the country is even less than in 1957; the main cause of this situation is that the policies toward the peasants in the past have been too stringent, and the development of agriculture has been stagnant, mainly due to the damage caused by "Left"ist errors. Some comrades said: Do not be afraid of the peasants getting rich. If it is believed that if the peasants become rich, capitalism will arise, then we will be poor for generations to come, and what are we revolutionizing for? Many suggestions were also made to quickly restore and develop agriculture. Chen Yun proposed in his speech: "In three to five years, we can import 20 million tons of grain each year. We cannot be nervous everywhere, we must first stabilize the peasants on this end." "Stabilizing this end is equivalent to stabilizing the majority... then everything will be settled." "This is the biggest economic measure." These opinions and suggestions received attention from the central leadership, and the two documents on agricultural issues were rewritten according to everyone's opinions.
During the discussion of Li Xiannian's summary speech at the State Council's Work Forum, many people agreed to reform the management system and implement the policy of opening up to the outside world. The meeting circulated a batch of materials introducing how foreign countries and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions of China developed their economies rapidly. After reading them, many comrades proposed changing the past practice of "no internal debt and no external debt", fully utilizing the favorable international situation for us, absorbing foreign capital as much as possible, importing advanced technology and equipment, and accelerating the pace of construction. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should quickly formulate laws related to accepting foreign loans, borrowing, and investment, and encourage foreign businessmen to jointly operate enterprises with us. These opinions further concretized the deliberations on the policy of reform and opening up, and the conditions for formally making the decision on reform and opening up have matured.
The conference also discussed issues such as party building, democratic and legal construction in the country. Combining with the painful lessons of the "Cultural Revolution", everyone talked about the need to restore the fine tradition of the party's democratic centralism and strengthen the necessity of socialist democracy and legal construction. They also put forward a series of suggestions to strengthen the democratic construction of the party and the country.
Deng Xiaoping watched the progress of the conference and, based on the discussions and issues raised by everyone, felt that the prepared speech was no longer applicable. He personally wrote an outline, listing seven key issues: "(1) Liberate the mind and set things in motion; (2) Promote democracy and strengthen the legal system; (3) Looking backward is for looking forward; (4) Overcome bureaucracy and excessive staffing; (5) Allow some to get rich first; (6) Strengthen the system of responsibility and make it more certain; (7) New problems." Based on this outline, several comrades redrafted the speech for him.
On December 13th, the closing ceremony of the conference was held, and Huo Guofeng, Ye Jianying, and Deng Xiaoping made speeches respectively. Huo Guofeng made self-criticism in his speech on the issue of the "Two Whatevers", admitting that "these two sentences were not fully considered" and "to varying degrees, they have bound our thinking and been detrimental to the implementation of the party's policies in a realistic and practical manner and detrimental to the liveliness of thoughts within the party." He announced that the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee would be held after the conference to further determine the principles and tasks for the transfer of the party's work focus.
Ye Jianying made three suggestions in his speech: (1) To have a good leadership team, especially the Central Committee needs to have a good leadership team; (2) To promote democracy and strengthen the legal system, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should assume its responsibility of formulating laws and improving the socialist legal system as soon as possible; (3) Diligently study and liberate the mind. He pointed out, "We are carrying out the socialist modernization construction, which is not only a significant improvement of the social productive forces, but also a profound social revolution from economic foundation to superstructure." Many people are still unprepared and their minds are not sufficiently liberated for such a revolution, so "we must eliminate the various superstitions caused by feudalism and free our thoughts from constraints."
Deng Xiaoping delivered an important speech entitled "Liberating the Mind, Seeking Truth from Facts, and Uniting to Look Forward". In this speech, he pointed out, "First, we need to liberate our minds. Only when our minds are liberated can we correctly solve the problems left over from the past and solve a series of new problems, with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guide." "Without breaking away from ideological rigidity and liberating the minds of officials and the masses, there is no hope for the Four Modernizations."
Deng Xiaoping summarized the discussion on the issue of the criterion of truth that had been passionately conducted throughout the party for the past six months. He pointed out that the discussion on the question of whether practice is the sole criterion of truth is actually also a debate on the need to liberate the mind. This debate is very necessary and of great significance. "If a party, a country, or a nation bases everything on its own book, with rigid thinking and prevailing superstition, it cannot progress, its vitality will cease, and the party and the country will perish." Currently, in order to restore the tradition of seeking truth from facts, it is necessary to liberate the mind and overcome the state of ideological rigidity formed due to various reasons. In this sense, "the debate on the question of the criterion of truth is indeed a question of ideological orientation, a political question, and a question that concerns the future and destiny of the party and the country."
Deng Xiaoping emphasized: to emancipate the mind, use our brains, a very important condition is to truly implement proletarian democratic centralism. In the current period, it is particularly necessary to emphasize democracy. We must create the conditions for democracy and strengthen socialist democracy and the rule of law. This conference has solved some past problems, clarified the merits and demerits of some individuals, corrected a number of major unjust, false, and erroneous cases. This is also a need to emancipate the mind, and the purpose is to look forward and smoothly achieve the shift of the party's work focus.
Regarding the upcoming reform, he said: to look forward, we must timely study new situations and solve new problems. Currently, our economic management work is bloated, with overlapping levels, cumbersome procedures, and extremely low efficiency. Political empty talk often drowns everything. This is not the responsibility of certain comrades, but the responsibility lies in our failure to propose reform in a timely manner. However, if we do not implement reform now, our modernization and socialist cause will be buried.
He also proposed that in the management system in the future, special attention should be paid to strengthening the system of responsibility. Any task, construction project, must implement a system with set tasks, set personnel, set quantity, set quality, and set time. In terms of economic policy, we should allow some regions and some individuals to have a higher income and a better life due to their hard work and great achievements. This will generate great demonstrative power, influence neighboring areas, and drive other regions, continuously advancing the entire national economy in a wave-like manner. "This is a major policy that can impact and drive the entire national economy."
Deng Xiaoping's speech not only put forward and answered a series of fundamental questions at a historical turning point, summarized the central work conference, but also provided guiding ideology for the upcoming Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Therefore, this speech actually became the theme report of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.
After the closing session, the conference continued for two days of discussions and ended on December 15th. With the promotion of the older generation revolutionaries and the joint efforts of the majority of participants, this 36-day Central Work Conference finally broke free from the "two whatevers" policy, turning the originally planned conference focused on economic work into a comprehensive rectification and new development conference.
2. The convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party
On the basis of achieving significant results in the Central Work Conference, from December 18th to 22nd, 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. The conference was attended by Central Committee members, alternate Central Committee members, and responsible comrades from central departments, totaling 290 people. Hua Guofeng announced at the opening ceremony: "The main task of this plenary session is to discuss and approve the proposal of the Central Political Bureau to shift the party's work focus to socialist modernization construction starting from January next year." The conference deliberated on and passed two documents on agricultural issues, namely, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Accelerating Agricultural Development (Draft)" and the "Regulations on Rural People's Communes (Trial)". It also discussed and approved the national economic plan arrangements for the years 1979 and 1980. Personnel matters were also discussed, and the establishment of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Committee was elected.
Prior to this, after 36 days of extensive discussions at the Central Work Conference, consensus has been reached among the comrades on some major issues. Based on this, the plenum decided to promptly and decisively end the nationwide mass movement of criticism and repudiation against Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," and from 1979 onwards, to shift the focus of the Party's work to socialist modernization construction. In the future, the policy for class struggle in socialist society should be to strictly differentiate and correctly handle two types of contradictions, to resolve them according to the procedures defined by the constitution and laws, never allowing the mixing of the boundaries between these two types of contradictions, and never allowing damage to the stable and united political situation necessary for socialist modernization construction. Since the policy of "taking class struggle as the key link" was put forward, this is the first time that the Party has formally imposed such clear restrictions and regulations on the issue of class struggle, which politically ensures the realization of the shift in work focus.
Under the guidance of the guiding principles of liberating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and seeking unity for advancement proposed by Deng Xiaoping, the comrades at the conference conducted in-depth discussions on the Party's ideological line issue. It was unanimously agreed that only under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, by liberating the mind, seeking truth from facts, starting from reality, and integrating theory with practice, can our Party successfully achieve the shift in work focus. The plenum highly praised the discussion on the proposition that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, considering it to have profound historical significance for promoting the liberation of ideology among all Party comrades and the entire nation, and for rectifying the ideological line.
Based on a diligent summary of the experiences and lessons since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the comrades at the conference universally felt that after implementing the shift in work focus, we must not continue to use the past management system and methods, but must boldly reform the traditional system and methods according to the needs of modernization construction and explore new development paths. The plenum announced in the communique: now, based on new historical conditions and practical experience, we should adopt a series of significant new economic measures, earnestly reform the economic management system and operational management methods, actively develop economic cooperation on the basis of self-reliance, and strive to adopt world advanced technology and equipment. This effectively makes the previous brewing about reform and opening up formally become the overall guiding principle for socialist modernization construction and the shift in work focus, and also marks the beginning of a new revolution initiated by the Party through reform and opening up to explore a new path for socialist construction.
During the discussion on agricultural issues, the plenum put forward a series of policy measures to promote agricultural development, such as raising the purchase prices of agricultural products, and agreed to send the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Accelerating Agricultural Development (Draft)" and the "Regulations on Rural People's Communes (Trial)" to all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government for discussion and implementation. The rewritten documents, with a solid grounding in reality, pointed out the backward status of agriculture in our country and proposed a series of policy measures to accelerate agricultural development. Among them, it emphasized the need to "respect the autonomy of production brigades," to politically guarantee the democratic rights of farmers, and to fully care about the material interests of farmers, thus initiating reforms in rural areas in practice.
When deliberating on the national economic plan arrangements for the years 1979 and 1980, the plenum affirmed the Central Work Conference's opinions on adjusting the national economy, and proposed the guiding principle that basic construction must be actively pursued within our capabilities, thereby rectifying the guiding ideology for economic construction.
The plenum confirmed the Central Work Conference's decision to rectify a series of major wrongful cases and reevaluate the merits and demerits of some important leaders. It reaffirmed the principle of seeking truth from facts and resolving historical legacy issues by appropriately addressing mistakes, thus initiating the process of rectifying all unjust, false, and wrong cases, comprehensively clearing up and thoroughly resolving the significant historical issues before and during the "Cultural Revolution".
The plenum also made a series of decisions to strengthen socialist democracy and the rule of law, improve the democratic centralism of the Party, and enhance Party discipline. It emphasized the need for national laws and Party rules and discipline. All Party members and cadres must comply with Party discipline.
While firmly correcting the errors of the "Cultural Revolution" and some previous "leftist" mistakes, the plenum affirmed the achievements of Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. The plenum communique pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong's great contributions in the long-term revolutionary struggle are indelible. At the same time, it noted that it is not Marxist or in line with Comrade Mao Zedong's own self-evaluation to demand that a revolutionary leader have no faults or mistakes. The central task of the Party is to lead and educate the entire Party and the people of the country to historically and scientifically recognize Comrade Mao Zedong's great achievements, fully and accurately grasp the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought, integrate the universal principles of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of socialist modernization, and develop them in the new historical conditions. This allows us to both objectively point out and correct the mistakes of Mao Zedong's later years, and respect the struggle history of the Party and the people, so as not to lose our direction and lose our fundamental standpoint.
After careful consideration, the plenum elected Chen Yun as a member of the Central Political Bureau, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau, and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee; elected Deng Yingchao, Hu Yaobang, and Wang Zhen as members of the Central Political Bureau; supplemented Huang Kecheng, Song Renqiong, Hu Qiaomu, Xi Zhongxun, Wang Renzhong, Huang Huoqing, Chen Zaidao, Han Guang, and Zhou Hui as members of the Central Committee, to be approved by the 12th National Party Congress; and elected the Central Discipline Inspection Committee, with Chen Yun as the Secretary, Deng Yingchao as the Deputy Secretary, Hu Yaobang as the Third Secretary, Huang Kecheng as the Executive Secretary, and Wang Heshou and others as Deputy Secretaries. On December 25th, the Central Political Bureau decided that Hu Yaobang would serve as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and concurrently as the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. Hu Qiaomu and Yao Yilin would serve as Deputy General Secretaries of the Communist Party of China. Wang Dongxing's concurrent appointment as Director of the Central Office was removed.
These organizational measures provided a reliable guarantee for the smooth implementation of the shift in work priorities and the implementation of the various guiding principles and policies determined by the plenum. Although Hua Guofeng was still the Chairman of the Party Central Committee at that time, in terms of reflecting the correct guiding ideology of the Party and determining the major guiding principles and policies for reform, opening up, and modernization, Deng Xiaoping had already become the core of leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The series of major decisions made by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee in ideological, political, economic, and organizational aspects marked the Party's reaffirmation of the ideological line, political line, and organizational line of Marxism. The plenum not only began a comprehensive rectification of the errors of the "Cultural Revolution" and the previous "leftist" mistakes but also laid a solid foundation for the Party to explore a new path of socialist construction under the correct guiding ideology.
As the work priorities of the Party and the country shifted, the guiding ideology of the Party and our country's socialist cause began to shift from "class struggle as the guiding principle" to putting the development of productive forces at the center, from a closed or semi-closed state to opening up to the outside world, from a highly centralized planned economic system to a vibrant socialist market economy system, and from Mao Zedong Thought as guidance to gradually shifting to Deng Xiaoping's theory as guidance. These transformations not only sparked a revolutionary change in China, completely transforming its impoverished and backward appearance but also broke through the old model of socialist construction that had fallen behind the times and become increasingly rigid, opening up a new path and theory for socialist construction with Chinese characteristics. Deng Xiaoping's report, "Liberate Thought, Seek Truth from Facts, Unite as One and Look Forward," is the declaration of opening a new era, a new path, and creating a new theory for socialist construction.
After 29 years of twists and turns, China's socialist cause has finally embarked on the path of victory. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is a milestone in achieving this great historical transformation and marks the beginning of a new path and new theories. A particularly notable statement in the communique of the plenary session reads: "To achieve the Four Modernizations, it is necessary to significantly increase productivity, which in turn requires comprehensive changes in the production relations, superstructure, management methods, activities, and thinking that are not compatible with the development of productive forces." With this historical requirement, China began a new era of reform and opening up, heading towards a great era.
Chapter 2: The comprehensive launch of rectification efforts and the adjustment of social relationships in the new situation
I. The comprehensive launch of rectification of wrong cases
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC, as the rectification work progressed and deepened throughout the party, a large-scale rectification of wrong cases and adjustment of social relationships was also launched, greatly liberating people's minds and mobilizing all aspects' enthusiasm.
1. Further clarification of major policy principles for rectifying wrong cases
Regarding the rectification of wrong cases, it is generally believed that it is conducted in two phases. The first phase is from the defeat of the "Gang of Four" to the period before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC. During this phase, the rectification of important figures and major events in the party's history created favorable political conditions for the ongoing historical transformation. However, the rectification work during this phase was not smooth sailing. Due to the deep-rooted influence of the expansion of class struggle within the party and the implementation and persistence of a series of "leftist" erroneous policies by the party's central leadership during these two years, the progress was hindered and the advancement was not smooth, and it could only be carried out partially and relatively slowly.
The convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC created conditions for the large-scale rectification of wrong cases. After the session, the work of rectifying wrong cases and implementing personnel policies rapidly and comprehensively unfolded nationwide. According to the documentary materials publicly released by the Central Organization Department, breakthroughs were made in the rectification of wrong cases during this period in the following aspects:
During the process of rectifying wrong cases and implementing personnel policies, the CPC Central Committee issued a series of important documents, including "Notice on Removing the Labels of Rightists from All Individuals," "Notice on Rectifying and Correcting Issues Concerning Those Labelled as Right Opportunist Elements," "Notice on Handling the Treatment of Central Documents Related to the Clearance of Historical Issues," "Notice on Publicly Rectifying the So-called 'Yang, Yu, Fu Incident,'" "Notice on Rectifying the So-called 'North China Clique'," "Notice on Diligently Conveying and Implementing the Resolution on Rectifying Comrade Liu Shaoqi's Situation," and a large number of other important documents. It also forwarded and endorsed a series of reports, such as the Central Organization Department's "Investigative Report on the 'Group of 61' Case," the Sichuan Provincial Committee's "Notice on Several Issues to Be Kept in Mind in the Implementation of Policies," the Shanghai Municipal Committee's "Request Report on Resolving the So-called 'January Revolution' Issue," the Central Organization Department's "Report on Rectifying the Novel 'Liu Zhidan'," the Supreme People's Court Party Group's "Request Report on Urgently Reinvestigating and Correcting Wrong, False, and Mistaken Cases and Seriously Implementing the Party's Policies," and the Central Organization Department's "Request Report on Several Issues Regarding the Successful Completion of the Work of Reinvestigating and Rectifying Wrong Cases in a Satisfactory Manner." In these documents and remarks, the central government, in accordance with the fundamental principle of seeking truth from facts established at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, has determined the "two no matters", that is: all false words, all incorrect conclusions and handling, regardless of when or under what circumstances they were done, regardless of which level of organization or who established and approved them, must be corrected; "correct all the wrongs, partially correct the partial, not correct not correct"; "solve problems while stabilizing the situation"; for political and historical issues, avoid getting into trivial details, do not leave any "loose ends"; for issues regarding misappropriation of property and wage deductions, due to large quantities, the central government has determined to "focus on solving the problems politically and providing appropriate economic compensation"; and the series of major policy principles such as "leaders taking responsibility, personally taking action, and the whole party handling cases."
Based on the relevant files and spirit of the central government, and following the instructions of the leading comrades of the central government, the Central Organization Department or in collaboration with the Central United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Education, the National Science and Technology Commission, the State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and other relevant departments, have studied and formulated a series of specific policy provisions for rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies.
Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, based on in-depth investigations and repeated discussions, the Central Organization Department successively formulated policy documents such as "Notification on Correctly Dealing with the Spouses and Children of Persons Under Investigation", "Notification on Not Implicating Children on Serious Historical and Political Issues of Their Parents", "Notification on Implementing Policy for Grassroots Cadres in Rural Areas", "Notification on Implementing Party Policy for Intellectuals", forming the guiding ideology, principles, and basic framework for rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, according to the arrangements of the central government, Hu Yaobang was transferred to the position of Secretary-General of the Central Committee and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Song Renqiong took over as Minister of the Central Organization Department. With the comprehensive implementation of rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, the Central Organization Department, in response to new problems encountered in their work, based on the spirit and requirements of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, accelerated the research, formulation, and implementation of policies for rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies. According to incomplete statistics, from 1979 to 1982, the Central Organization Department, or in collaboration with relevant departments of the central and state authorities, researched and formulated nearly thirty specific policy provisions on a particular aspect, further improving the guidelines and policy system for rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies.
The formulation and implementation of these guidelines and policies have greatly promoted the unity and improvement in understanding among various organizations and leaders regarding rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, standardized the methods and procedures in specific work, and ensured that all levels of organizations have "laws" to follow and guidelines to uphold in the work of rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, thus guaranteeing the continuous development of this work along a healthy track.
2. Further emancipating the mind and advancing the work of rectifying wrong cases
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in the work of rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, some units and regions still have remnants of "leftist" thinking among their leaders and workers, especially under the influence of the "two no matters" errors, their thinking is not emancipated. They continue to delay the study and resolution of certain cases, stubbornly refuse to handle problems that should be resolved when assigned by higher authorities, and even believe that policy implementation has gone too far. Some leaders in certain regions and units, due to factionalism, have been passive and resistant in their attitude towards rectifying wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, have failed to solve the problems of certain individuals for a long time, and even covered them up. To address these issues, relevant departments of the central government, firstly, need to increase efforts in implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, widely publicize the ideological line of the Communist Party of liberating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and further eliminate the remnants of "leftist" thinking, especially the interference caused by the "two no matters". Secondly, by redressing major cases of wrongful conviction, it promotes people's ideological liberation, advances the redress of wrongful cases, and implements policies for cadres. For example, by redressing the wrongful conviction of Liu Shaoqi, the greatest miscarriage of justice during the "Cultural Revolution," it greatly promoted the further liberation of the minds of cadres and the masses, effectively pushed for the redress of wrongful cases, and implemented policies for cadres. Thirdly, documents were formulated and issued to clearly stipulate that deliberate delays and passive resistance in redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres due to resistance to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee or sectarian interference must be dealt with seriously and necessary organizational measures be taken.
During the process of redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres, some leaders and staff members, due to insufficient understanding of the importance, continuity, and difficulty of this work, have developed similar thoughts and slackened emotions. Some of them even disbanded the institutions without inspection and acceptance. For this reason, party organizations at all levels have strengthened the education on the importance and difficulty of redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres, making them realize the profound historical significance and significant practical significance of redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres and understand the historical responsibilities they bear. Emphasis is placed on ensuring the redress of wrongful cases and the implementation of policies for cadres from beginning to end, and being responsible for the political life of each comrade. We must not only focus on the surface problems that have been resolved 80% or 90%, as long as one wrongful case has not been corrected, then for that comrade, his problem is 100% unresolved. Each case and each comrade must be dealt with solidly, withstand the test of history. At the same time, the requirements for carrying out inspection and acceptance work and the acceptance criteria are put forward.
In response to the problems of neglecting in-depth and meticulous ideological work, and the unreasonable or excessive demands made by a small number of people or their relatives who have been implemented with policies, and even causing trouble for no reason, the Central Organization Department has required the strengthening of political and ideological work in redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres. We must patiently and meticulously do the ideological work of implementing policies for the targets, and leaders at all levels must personally conduct the ideological work of comrades who have been persecuted and their families, encourage them to lift their spirits, work hard, unite, and look forward, and contribute to realizing the "Four Modernizations." Emphasis is placed on solving problems politically when implementing policies, without getting entangled in trivial matters. We must strengthen the political care and protection for those implementing policies and strictly follow the party's policies. Criticism and education are necessary for those who cause trouble for no reason.
3. New progress in redressing wrongful cases during the "Cultural Revolution"
Under the guidance of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, after the efforts of the whole party, by the end of 1982, the task of redressing wrongful cases during the "Cultural Revolution" had been basically completed, achieving a decisive victory in redressing wrongful cases and implementing policies for cadres. In total, 2.3 million cadres who were filed for "review and investigation" during the "Cultural Revolution" were re-examined and redressed, and nearly 20,000 cases of collective wrongful conviction were resolved, including several major cases that had a significant impact throughout the party, the country, and the world.
(1) A large number of senior cadres were re-examined and redressed after receiving the review materials from the central special case group. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Party decided to abolish the organization of the central special case leadership group and transfer all the archives to the Central Organization Department. In order to implement the decision of the plenary session, on December 19, 1978, comrades from the central special case group and the Central Organization Department, including Wang Dongxing, the former leader of the central special case leadership group, and Ji Dengkui, Wu De, held a meeting to convey the decision of the plenary session. Comrades responsible for the Central Organization Department, such as Hu Yaobang, Minister of the Central Organization Department, Chen Yeping, Vice Minister, Zhao Cangbi, Minister of the Ministry of Public Security, and the three special case offices and the responsible comrades of the Organization Department's investigation and audit bureau, attended the meeting. It was announced at the meeting that the First Office, the Third Office, and the "May 16" special case joint office of the central special case review group were abolished from that day onwards. All project materials shall be handed over to the Central Organization Department for processing. During the handover process, no materials may be destroyed. On the morning of December 20th, Vice Minister Chen Ye Ping of the Central Organization Department conveyed the spirit of the handover meeting at the department's hall meeting with directors and bureau chiefs. He made specific arrangements for the reception and review work and mobilized a dedicated team to establish the receiving organization, working day and night on this task. By the end of February 1979, all project materials had been successfully transferred. The Central Organization Department received a total of 1,730 volumes and 391,363 items of materials from the original Central Investigation Group, involving a total of 669 people under investigation.
Subsequently, the Central Organization Department immediately carried out the review and rehabilitation work. According to statistics, there were 213 cadres included in the central investigative cases, including deputy ministers of central and state organs, vice governors of provinces, autonomous regions, and directly governed municipalities (including cadres at the equivalent military level). Among them were 10 members of the Eighth Political Bureau, 10 members of the Central Secretariat, 71 Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members (excluding those reviewed by provinces and cities), 7 deputy prime ministers of the State Council, as well as marshals and generals who fought in the south and north, party secretaries and deputy governors of the central bureau, provinces, autonomous regions, and directly governed municipalities, ministers and deputy ministers of central organs and State Council departments, heads of agencies and a group of experts, professors, writers, and technical personnel, and even a small number of residents and students. Among the reviewed individuals, 320 were classified as having "serious problem nature or enemy-contradiction," accounting for 47.8% of those under investigation. With so many major cases, in order to make objective and fair review and rehabilitation conclusions in a short period of time, relying solely on the strength of the Central Organization Department was evidently impossible. In view of this, the Central Organization Department took the following measures: First, all leading comrades who had been sent by the central investigation group to work in other places while still under supervisory labor were immediately brought back to Beijing and relevant units. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Organization Department had greater initiative in this matter. Peng Zhen and his wife Zhang Jieqing returned to Beijing after the meeting. Wang Guangmei, who had been detained, was also released. Other comrades were also gradually brought back by various units. Second, for some comrades, a method of first assigning work and then conducting review and rehabilitation was adopted, enabling these leading comrades to return to their work posts as soon as possible. Third, following the principles of the Party's handling of cases and the mass line, a method of transferring the cases to the original units for review and then submitting them to the Central Organization Department for adjudication and approval was adopted, greatly speeding up the progress of review and rehabilitation. Practice has proved that these measures have achieved good results. From 1979 to 1980, a total of 445 people were directly concluded by the Central Organization Department and reported to the central government for approval, including a large number of senior leaders such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Tao Zhu, Liu Lantao, Xi Zhongxun, An Ziwen, Qian Ying, Hu Qiaomu, Shuai Mengqi, Zhao Yimin, Lin Feng, Tan Zhenlin, Li Lisan, Wang Renzhong, and so on.
(2) A number of major influential cases were thoroughly rectified.
①The Wuhan "720 incident" was thoroughly rectified. The Wuhan "720 incident" occurred on July 20, 1967, when the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Wuhan took to the streets to protest against the conspiracy activities of the "Gang of Four," which sent people to create chaos within the military, destroy the relationship between the military and civilians, support violent struggles, support looting and destruction, and undermine production. Afterwards, Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" fabricated the "720 incident" as a "thoroughly counterrevolutionary event," falsely accusing Wang Renzhong, Chen Zaidao, and other leading figures of the Hubei Provincial Committee and the Wuhan Military Region Party Committee of being the "backstage" of the "720 incident," branding a group of party, government, and military leaders as a "tiny handful of capitalist roaders" within the party and military, and subjecting the broad masses of cadres and public who participated in or supported the demonstrations to cruel persecution. In the struggle against the "Gang of Four", the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and the Wuhan Military Region Party Committee, based on the demands of the cadres and masses, studied and believed that Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" distorted the facts and confused right and wrong by labeling the "July 20th Incident" as a "counterrevolutionary incident". They should be rehabilitated, and all false accusations imposed on the People's Liberation Army and the cadres and masses should be completely overturned. They submitted the "Request Report on Dealing with the Wuhan 'July 20th Incident'" to the central government. In November 1978, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China forwarded the request report from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and the Wuhan Military Region Party Committee, thoroughly rehabilitating the Wuhan "July 20th Incident".
②To rehabilitate the so-called "February Counterflow" issue. In February 1967, Tan Zhenlin, Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and other leaders of the Central Politburo and Military Commission, at meetings such as the Central Military Commission Meeting and the Central Politburo Meeting, criticized the incorrect practices of the "Cultural Revolution" proposed by Lin Biao, the "Gang of Four", Kang Sheng, and Chen Boda, and instigated the slogan "topple everything, start a comprehensive civil war" with the intention of destabilizing the military and the nation, and seizing power from the party. They strongly criticized the "Cultural Revolution" and conducted a resolute and confrontational struggle against Lin Biao, the "Gang of Four", Kang Sheng, and Chen Boda. However, they were suppressed and repressed under the accusation of "February Counterflow". After the defeat of the Lin Biao group, Mao Zedong proposed to rehabiliate the "February Counterflow" and pointed out: Once this matter is clarified, we should no longer mention the "February Counterflow". After the defeat of the "Gang of Four", at the Central Work Conference in 1978, the Central Committee pointed out that the so-called "February Counterflow" was entirely a distortion and deliberate fabrication by Lin Biao and his group, with the aim of overthrowing several senior generals and vice premiers who opposed them, and then overthrowing Zhou Enlai and Zhu De. The Central Committee decided that all comrades who had been wronged due to this case should have their reputation restored, and all comrades who had been implicated and punished should be rehabilitated. All false statements regarding the so-called "February Counterflow" in various documents and materials in the past should be nullified.
③To rehabilitate the "61-person Traitor Group" case. The so-called "61-person Traitor Group" case was a major political case that caused a sensation at home and abroad during the "Cultural Revolution". The so-called "traitors" referred to 61 members of the Chinese Communist Party, including Bo Yibo, who were released from Caolanzi Prison in Beiping in 1936 with special approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. During the "Cultural Revolution", only 40 of them survived, among whom 22 held leadership positions such as provincial party secretary, deputy provincial governor, deputy minister of central agencies, and even vice premier of the State Council. At that time, not only did these 40 veteran comrades suffer persecution, but their families, their relatives, and their former subordinates were almost all implicated. Tens of thousands of people were subject to investigation and persecution. In June 1978, Deng Xiaoping instructed in a letter of appeal regarding the "61-person case": "We must deal with this issue, which is also a matter of seeking truth from facts." In accordance with the spirit of this instruction, the Organization Department of the Central Committee conducted a review of this case. On December 6 of the same year, the central government agreed to and forwarded the investigation report on the "61-person Case" by the Organization Department, pointing out that it was a major wrongful case and calling for correction and arrangements for the comrades who had been wrongly handled as a result. This way, justice was served for this major miscarriage of justice.
④To rehabilitate the cadres and masses who were criticized and persecuted in the so-called "January Revolution". The so-called "January Revolution" refers to the period from January 4, 1967, when Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan returned to Shanghai, to February 5, when they established the "Shanghai People's Commune", during which they opened a gap in Shanghai and engaged in a conspiracy to seize power overall.
In 1966, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan colluded with Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing, and instigated the slogan "oppose the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee". On January 4, 1967, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan returned to Shanghai and further incited "no need to have illusions about the Municipal Committee" and "the current fundamental issue is to take back the leadership from the capitalist roaders", and propagated the overthrow of everything and the comprehensive seizure of power. On January 6, under the pretense of various revolutionary organizations in the city, they held a "Down with the Municipal Committee Conference", criticized the leadership comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and brought hundreds of bureau-level or higher cadres to the meeting to be criticized. They declared that they no longer recognized Cao Diqiu as the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and the mayor. In fact, they seized power in Shanghai and established the so-called "Shanghai People's Commune" on February 5. Subsequently, a wave of power seizure swept the whole country, and in many places it even escalated into armed conflicts, resulting in many local party and government organizations falling into a paralyzed or semi-paralyzed state, and further serious destruction of social order and industrial and agricultural production.
The so-called "January Revolution" was completely a conspiracy carefully planned by Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the "Gang of Four". It was an important step for them to disrupt the entire country and carry out a comprehensive seizure of party power. 
In December 1978, the Shanghai Municipal Committee decided to reverse the public criticism of Cao Diqiu and others and all persecuted cadres and masses in the "January Revolution". In January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China forwarded the Shanghai Municipal Committee's "Report on Addressing the Issue of the so-called 'January Revolution'" and thoroughly reversed the cadres and masses who were criticized and persecuted during the so-called "January Revolution".
⑤ To publicly reverse the "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident". In March 1968, Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" fabricated the so-called "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident" in order to counter the military and seize party power, creating the so-called "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident". They falsely accused Yang Chengwu (alternate member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, standing committee member of the Central Military Commission, acting chief of the General Staff), Yu Lijin (political commissar of the Air Force, second secretary of the Air Force Party Committee), and Fu Chongbi (commander of the Beijing Garrison District) of "reversing the February tide". They fabricated that Yang Chengwu "colluded with Yu Lijin to seize the leadership of the Air Force" and "colluded with Fu Chongbi to seize the power of Beijing", and "fabricated black materials against Jiang Qing", and "Yang Chengwu gave three orders to Fu Chongbi to go from Goashan Island to the Central Cultural Revolution to arrest people", and even "attacked Jiang Qing". They said that Yang Chengwu's "hidden support" was "Ye Jianying, Nie Rongzhen, Chen Yi, and Tan Zhenlin". They falsely accused Yu Lijin of being a "traitor" and slandered Yang, Yu, and Fu as the "hidden support of May 16", and so on. They even included the "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident" as the "evil wind of reversing the February tide" in the Communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Party Central Committee and the political report of the 9th National Congress. Yang Chengwu, Yu Lijin, Fu Chongbi, and others were brutally persecuted, and a large number of comrades were implicated nationwide, some were disabled or killed, causing serious consequences. In March 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on publicly reversing the "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident", pointing out that the so-called "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident" was a wrongful case fabricated by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" against the party. The central government decided to publicly reverse the "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident". All unfounded accusations should be overturned, and the documents issued by the central government in the past should be revoked. As for the comrades who were implicated and persecuted in this case and were forced to die or become disabled, their names should be cleared, and their reputations should be restored.
⑥ To publicly reverse the so-called "North China Regionalism". In March 1968, Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" fabricated the charges of "North China Regionalism" and "Shanxi-Shaanxi-Hebei Regionalism" during the fabrication of the "Yang, Yu, Fu Incident". Afterwards, in the Beijing Military Region, they repeatedly launched a large-scale campaign against the so-called "North China Regionalism", directly targeting Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, Luo Ruiqing, and Yang Chengwu, who had served as major leaders in the North China region. They falsely accused and brutally persecuted some leading comrades in the Beijing Military Region, implicated a large number of comrades, disrupted people's thinking, undermined the unity and construction of the troops, and caused serious consequences and influence. In December 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice entitled "Regarding the Rectification of the So-Called 'North China Factionalism'," stating that Lin Biao and the Gang of Four's defamation of the glorious history of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, North China Military Region, and Beijing Military Region was completely driven by their counterrevolutionary political needs. They regarded the Beijing Military Region as a serious obstacle to their anti-revolutionary coup, so they repeatedly launched attacks against the "North China Factionalism," doing everything they could to overthrow the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries who had previously worked in North China and some leading comrades in the Beijing Military Region, in order to realize their conspiracy to seize party and state power. The Central Committee officially declared that the so-called "Jin-Cha-Ji Factionalism," "North China Factionalism," and others were all false accusations and should be thoroughly rejected. All related materials should be revoked. Comrades who were persecuted and implicated in this case should be fully rehabilitated and their reputation restored.
⑦ Rectify the wrongful cases of Liu Shaoqi and a large number of comrades who were implicated in the wrongful case of Liu Shaoqi. The wrongful case of Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China, was the largest wrongful case during the "Cultural Revolution" and the largest wrongful case in the history of the People's Republic.
After the downfall of the Gang of Four, a large number of cadres and the masses inside and outside of the party requested and advised the Central Committee to reexamine the case of Liu Shaoqi. In February 1979, the Central Committee decided that the case of Liu Shaoqi should be reexamined by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Central Organization Department. The results of the reexamination were carefully discussed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in February 1980, and the Resolution on Rehabilitating Comrade Liu Shaoqi was unanimously passed. It stated: "The three major accusations of 'traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader' that were unjustly imposed on Comrade Liu Shaoqi in the original review report, as well as other various charges, were entirely the deliberate frame-up by the clique of Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, and Chen Boda. The decision made at the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee to 'permanently expel Liu Shaoqi from the party and revoke all his party and non-party positions' was wrong." "Comrade Liu Shaoqi was a great Marxist and a proletarian revolutionary who devoted his whole life to the struggle for communism. As one of the outstanding leaders of the party and the country, he made indelible contributions to the construction of our party, the democratic and socialist revolutions in our country, and socialist construction." "All the previous slanders, accusations, forged materials, and all false accusations against Comrade Liu Shaoqi should be completely overturned."
The Plenary Session decided to revoke the charges imposed on Liu Shaoqi and the handling resolution against him by the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, restore the honor of Liu Shaoqi as a great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary, and rehabilitate the wrongful, false, and mistaken cases related to the Liu Shaoqi issue. On March 19, 1980, the Central Committee issued a notice entitled "Regarding the Thorough Implementation of the Resolution Rehabilitating Comrade Liu Shaoqi."
The Plenary Session required that party organizations at all levels actively and responsibly continue to resolve similar outstanding and unresolved issues in line with this spirit. In order to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Organization Department forwarded the notice from the Guizhou Provincial Committee entitled "Regarding Rectifying the Wrongful, False, and Mistaken Cases Caused by the Liu Shaoqi Issue and Effectively Implementing the Party's Policies" on April 18, 1980. It demanded that all regions and departments strive to complete the rehabilitation work for those implicated in the wrongful case of Liu Shaoqi and other wrongful, false, and mistaken cases during the "Cultural Revolution" in the first half of the year. On May 17, a memorial meeting for Liu Shaoqi was solemnly held in Beijing. More than 10,000 representatives from the party and state leadership and various sectors in the capital attended the memorial meeting. The rehabilitation of Liu Shaoqi cleared his name and also thoroughly rehabilitated tens of thousands of people who were implicated in the wrongful case of Liu Shaoqi nationwide. The rehabilitation of this highly influential wrongful case further liberated the thinking of a large number of cadres and promoted the rehabilitation work of other wrongful, false, and mistaken cases.
⑧ Rectify the cases of comrades unjustly accused due to the so-called "First Big Character Poster" nationwide. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Nie Yuanzi, the secretary of the Party branch of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, and others accused the Party Committee of Peking University and individuals such as Lu Ping (Secretary of the Party Committee of Peking University), Song Shuo (Deputy Minister of the University Science Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee), and Peng Peiyun (Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Peking University) of publishing the so-called "First Big-character Poster". This accusation was applauded by Mao Zedong. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, and Chen Boda fabricated charges against Lu Ping, Song Shuo, Peng Peiyun, and others, leading to their persecution. Not only was the big-character poster broadcasted on the radio, but the People's Daily also organized commentator articles to praise it, causing a very bad influence nationwide. This was a major wrongful case that occurred in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. In February 1979, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to completely clear the Party Committee of Peking University and Lu Ping, Song Shuo, and Peng Peiyun. In August 1980, the Central Organization Department forwarded the Notice from the Beijing Municipal Committee on completely clearing the comrades who were unjustly accused in the so-called "First Big-character Poster" nationwide, ensuring that this wrongful case was completely cleared.
⑨ Completely clear the so-called "Black Party" and "Fake Party" accusations. During the Cultural Revolution, under the influence of Lin Biao and the Gang of Four's ultra-leftist line, the underground party organization of the 38th Army of the former Yang Hucheng Department was falsely accused of being the "Black Party" and "Fake Party". Many old comrades in this organization were falsely accused of being the "true Kuomintang, false Communist Party" and were labeled as "traitors" and "spies", suffering from cruel persecution. After the Gang of Four was overthrown, an investigation by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee found that the accusations of the so-called "Black Party" and "Fake Party" were completely unfounded. After reporting to the central authorities, in February 1981, the Central Organization Department forwarded the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee's request report on completely clearing the accusations against the underground party organization of the 38th Army of the former Yang Hucheng Department as the "Black Party" and "Fake Party". Thoroughly clear the accusations against the underground party organization of the 38th Army of the former Yang Hucheng Department and the underground party members who were persecuted in this case, eliminate all false accusations, and handle the aftermath properly.
⑩ Completely clear the so-called "Red Flag Party" accusations. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement in 1943, Kang Sheng fabricated the so-called "Red Flag Party" case. Underground parties in Gansu, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and other places were falsely accused of being the "Red Flag Party", and many underground party members were labeled as "spies", "traitors", and "internal agents". In the later stage of the Yan'an rectification, the central authorities found that the so-called "Red Flag Party" case fabricated by Kang Sheng was completely false and made timely corrections. However, due to the historical conditions at that time, a comprehensive conclusion was not reached. During the Cultural Revolution, this historical issue was brought up again, and many comrades were once again falsely accused and subjected to brutal struggles. Some were even persecuted to disability or death. In order to completely resolve the legacy of the so-called "Red Flag Party" and eliminate the adverse consequences caused by Kang Sheng's fabrication, in September 1981, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the Notice on officially clearing the underground party organizations in Gansu, Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces that were falsely accused of being the "Red Flag Party". Thoroughly clear all false accusations imposed on these underground party organizations, and completely clear and vindicate the comrades who were persecuted in this case.
⑪ Completely clear Pan Hannian's name and restore his reputation. Pan Hannian was an old party member of our party and has held important leadership positions both within and outside the party. He made significant contributions to the party's cultural work, united front work, and particularly in carrying out concealed struggle against the enemy. Since 1955, due to serious neglect of the particular nature of the concealed struggle against the enemy, confusion of the boundaries of right and wrong, and the enemy and ourselves, Pan Hannian was falsely labeled as an "internal traitor". He was arrested, detained, and subjected to investigation, and later convicted, sentenced, and expelled from the party. He remained wrongly accused and suffered for more than twenty years until his death in 1977. Because of Pan Han's issues, many comrades who had worked with him in the past were also unjustly treated for a long time. In March 1981, the Party Central Committee instructed the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to reexamine the Pan case. The CCDI retrieved and studied materials from various aspects, and also conducted investigations with dozens of comrades who had worked with Pan Han in the past. The review results showed that the previous conclusion that Pan Han was a "spy" could not stand and should be denied. This was a major wrongful case since the founding of New China. On August 23, 1982, the central government issued a document solemnly announcing to the entire party: Pan Han has been vindicated and his reputation restored; for comrades who were mistakenly implicated and dealt with inappropriately due to the Pan case, their cases should also be reexamined and redressed in a realistic and fair manner, and post-settlement issues should be properly handled.
(3) Conduct a review and redress for a group of party and state leaders, hundreds of provincial and ministerial-level cadres, and a large number of well-known figures from various fields.
During the "Cultural Revolution," a large number of important party and state leaders were impacted and persecuted. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee successively conducted a review and redress of the issues of a group of party, state, government, and military leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Tao Zhu, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Yang Shangkun, Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, Tan Zhenlin, Xi Zhongxun, Huang Kecheng, Wang Renzhong, Song Renqiong, and Luo Ruiqing. The issue of martyr Qu Qiubai, an early leader of our party, was also redressed.
Before the "Cultural Revolution," there were a total of 1,253 vice provincial governors and vice ministers or higher-level cadres across the country. Among them, 1,011 were impacted during the "Cultural Revolution," accounting for 81% of the total number of cadres at the same level. Among them, 453 were falsely accused of being "traitors," "spies," "counterrevolutionary revisionist elements," "agents of the capitalist headquarters," or "executors of the revisionist line," accounting for 36% of the total number (excluding those directly examined by the original Central Special Case Group). Most of the so-called reviews of these cadres were based on groundless accusations, fabricated slanders, or the exaggeration of minor issues and the labeling of them as major offenses, which resulted in severe damage to these comrades both mentally and physically. Forty comrades died with grievances during the "review" period, and some comrades were left with lifelong disabilities.
After the fall of the "Gang of Four," the Central Organization Department, entrusted by the central authorities, conducted a review or trial of the conclusions of 453 vice provincial governors, vice ministers or higher-level cadres from 1978 to the end of 1980.
All 85 individuals who were regarded as enemies during the "Cultural Revolution" have been completely vindicated and their reputations restored. For those who had historical issues and faced intensified reevaluations during the "Cultural Revolution," most of their previous conclusions were maintained. After implementing the policies, those comrades who were physically fit and capable were appointed to leadership positions, and those who were in poor health were properly placed, while those who died with grievances received posthumous rehabilitation. Work was done to eliminate the impact on comrades, their family members, and children caused by these mistaken cases.
(4) Redress the mistakes and false accusations of certain central government departments during the "Cultural Revolution." The main tasks were: revoking the erroneous conclusion of the Central Committee's External Liaison Department, which had implemented the policy of "three representatives and one inheritor for each department" and "three reductions and one extermination"; completely redressing the so-called "Yanwang Palace" of the Central Propaganda Department; removing the label of "implementing the surrenderist line" from the National United Front, Ethnic Affairs, and Religious Affairs departments; thoroughly redressing the mistaken case of labeling the original Ministry of Culture as the "department of emperors, prime ministers, and dead foreigners"; completely redressing the wrongful case of the Political Department of the PLA being falsely accused as the "Yanwang Palace" and revoking the "Summary of Symposium on Military Literary Work" issued in February 1966; overturning the conclusion of the so-called "implementation of the revisionist line" imposed on the education front and revoking the "Summary of National Education Work Conference" in 1971; and so on.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, party organizations at all levels further conducted a review and redress of a large number of well-known figures in various fields such as literature and art, sports, science and technology, and health.
II. Properly handle historical legacy issues.
Properly handling historical legacy issues is an important part of rectifying work and a challenging task in implementing cadre policies. 
Due to the influence of the erroneous "left" ideology in previous political movements, as well as some mistakes in work, the special historical conditions of the war era, failure to resolve some complex problems in time, and various other reasons, a large number of historical legacy issues have been left behind. According to incomplete statistics, there are millions of cases left over from the "Cultural Revolution" in the whole country, involving millions of people and affecting tens of millions of people.
With the restoration and development of the Party's principle of seeking truth from facts, the call for rectifying wrongful cases and implementing cadre policies has been increasing as more appeals to solve historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution" emerge. This is not only an inevitable requirement for our Party to emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, rectify wrongful cases, and develop the implementation of cadre policies, but also directly related to the rectification of wrongful cases during the "Cultural Revolution". Many wrongful cases during the "Cultural Revolution" were intentionally brought up again by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four", causing endless confusion and harm. Therefore, with the deepening development of rectifying wrongful cases and implementing cadre policies, many historical legacy issues are inevitably involved. If these issues are not properly handled, the enthusiasm of these cadres and masses will be difficult to mobilize and exert, and the stability and development of the situation of unity and stability will be difficult to consolidate. The principle of seeking truth from facts of the Party will not be thoroughly restored and developed.
Shortly after the rectification of wrongful cases and the implementation of cadre policies began, the review and correction of legacy issues from the "Anti-Rightist" and "Four Cleanups" movements were already on the agenda. The central authorities issued relevant documents, clearly defining the relevant policy provisions, and started to review and correct historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution".
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially after the rectification of wrongful cases during the "Cultural Revolution" was basically completed, the focus shifted to properly handling historical legacy issues in the work of rectifying wrongful cases and implementing cadre policies. A large number of major historical legacy issues were reviewed and dealt with, such as the "Anti-Rightist," "Anti-Right Deviationist," "Four Cleanups," "Underground Party," "Intelligence Personnel," "Mistaken Executions in the Anti-Rightist Campaign in the Red Army," "Huxi Purge," and "Central Plains Breakthrough." This work was basically completed before the Thirteenth National Congress in 1987.
How to actively and properly handle historical legacy issues is related to whether the rectification of wrongful cases and the implementation of cadre policies can proceed steadily and healthily, as well as to the stability of the overall situation of unity and stability. Therefore, the Central Organization Department and relevant departments of the central state organs focused on the following two areas of work in macro guidance:
1. Make efforts to eliminate various obstacles and disturbances
In the initial stage of handling historical legacy issues, the obstacles and disturbances mainly came from the "left" side. Some people continue to view historical legacy issues from a "leftist" standpoint and do not correct the wrong classification.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, another incorrect tendency appeared in the review and correction of historical legacy issues, which is that some people adopt a negative attitude toward everything and demand a thorough review of the problems in all political movements since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the historical legacy issues before its establishment. The calls for this are getting louder and there is a trend of an increasing number of letters and visits. Even things that shouldn't be changed were changed. To address these issues, in June 1979, the Central Organization Department held a symposium on "Implementing Cadre Policy Work." In the symposium, the leadership of the Organization Department clearly pointed out that there is a difference between the wrongful, fabricated, and incorrect cases during the "Cultural Revolution" and the incorrect cases before the "Cultural Revolution". For old cases before the "Cultural Revolution," the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism should be used, following the principles of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes when they occur. In general, we should deal with the problems at that time based on the situation, conditions, and policies at that time. Guidelines and principles were put forward for dealing with the historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution". After the meeting, with the approval of the central government, the Central Organization Department issued a notice on the handling of some cases before the "Cultural Revolution". The document pointed out that in addition to the correction of historical cases of falsely accusing rightists and the correction of cases wrongly handled during the anti-rightist struggle since 1959 and the rectification of cases in the "Four Cleanups" movement, which had been regulated by the central government, the remaining cases could be reviewed and tried according to the principle of handling them individually. It is fundamentally different from the large number of wrongful, false, and mistaken cases caused by the serious interference and destruction of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" during the "Cultural Revolution". If we do not analyze these old cases in a historical manner and review and handle them all again based on the current policy standpoint, it will inevitably lead to confusion, affect stability and unity, and alienate a large number of party cadres and the masses. Historical cases should be handled cautiously considering different situations. For those who have made mistakes and have been properly handled based on the party's policy at that time, or even if the handling was somewhat heavy, but the main facts have not changed, no further review should be conducted. For cases where the main basis for the original qualification was untrue, and cases that were wrongly expelled from the party, dismissed from public office, and concluded as enemies according to the party's policies at that time, a review and correction should be conducted. Party membership can be restored or rejoining the party is possible for those who were wrongly expelled from the party but have performed well subsequently and meet the membership requirements.
In order to further improve the review work of historical legacy issues, the Central Organization Department convened a symposium in Yichang, Hubei Province in January 1983, attended by organization departments of seventeen provincial and municipal party committees and comrades from some central state organs. At the meeting, experiences in this work were exchanged, difficulties encountered in the work were studied, opinions and measures for solving the problems were put forward, and the principles and tasks of this work were further determined. After the meeting, the Central Organization Department issued a notice and distributed the Summary of the Symposium on the Review and Correction of Wrongful, False, and Mistaken Cases before the "Cultural Revolution", stating that the wrongful, false, and mistaken cases that occurred before the "Cultural Revolution" were mainly caused by restrictions in understanding at that time and work mistakes, and they are fundamentally different from the large number of wrongful, false, and mistaken cases deliberately created by the specific historical conditions of the "Cultural Revolution" and the counter-revolutionary group of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. To review and correct the wrongful, false, and mistaken cases before the "Cultural Revolution" and solve the historical legacy problems, the policies and regulations approved by the Central Organization Department and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee should be followed. Taking into account the background at the time, based on factual materials, a historical and comprehensive approach should be taken, each case should be analyzed specifically, and the principle of seeking truth from facts should be adhered to. Any mistakes should be corrected actively and carefully in a step-by-step manner. In the work, attention should be paid to preventing two kinds of deviations: one is to continue viewing historical old cases from a "left" perspective, not correcting cases that were wrongly handled, or even not dealing with cases that one has processed and approved despite their obvious errors; The other is to take a negationist view and change things that should not be changed. For the cases before the "Cultural Revolution", all appeals and cases that may have been mishandled but were not appealed should be reviewed, with a focus on major cases, key cases, public cases, and cases that were categorized as enemies or wrongly expelled from the party or dismissed from public office. The handling of cases should be based on facts and guided by the party's policies. Those cases with principally unfounded conclusions should be completely overturned; those cases based on solid evidence but with wrong handling should be corrected; those cases with clear facts, conclusive evidence, and correct handling of conclusions, or those cases with no significant difference in the main basis, and whose handling is generally appropriate but biased, can remain unchanged, and some consideration can be given in terms of their use and daily life. After rectifying wrongful and unjust cases, the focus should be on resolving the problems politically. It is necessary to do ideological work well, while handling the aftermath properly according to relevant regulations.
Through these two meetings and the documents issued afterwards, the work of properly handling historical legacy issues has been effectively promoted and advanced.
2. Develop correct guidelines and policies for addressing historical legacy issues.
The proper handling of historical legacy issues is of great responsibility and has strong policy implications. It directly relates to the recognition and evaluation of martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution, as well as the political lives of some comrades. There is no room for any negligence. It must be strictly implemented in accordance with the central guidelines and policies. Therefore, it is particularly important to establish correct guidelines and policies.
Under the guidance and care of the central leadership and older generation revolutionaries, the Party Central Committee and relevant departments of the central state organs have successively formulated a series of policies and regulations on handling historical legacy issues, including the "Notice on Removing the Hats of Rightists," the "Implementation Plan for Implementing the Central Decision on Removing the Hats of Rightists," the "Notice on Rehabilitating and Correcting the Cases of Individuals Labelled as Right-Wing Opportunists," the "Notice on Handling Recommendations for Some Cases before the 'Cultural Revolution'," the "Supplementary Notice on Handling Recommendations for Some Cases before the 'Cultural Revolution'," the "Notice on Issuing the Summary of the Discussion Meeting on the Review of Cases of Wrongful Convictions prior to the 'Cultural Revolution'," the "Notice on Forwarding the Opinions of the Party Group of the Ministry of Railways on the Review of Wrongful Convictions since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," the "Notice on Forwarding the Report on the Investigation and Review of the Queueing and Review Work on Cases of Wrongful Convictions before the 'Cultural Revolution' by the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee," and other policies and regulations on handling historical legacy issues. These policies and regulations clearly put forward the principles, guidelines, and policy limits for addressing historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution," and strictly define the scope, focal points, and approval authority of the review process. Practice has proven that these policy regulations have played an important role in promptly unifying understandings, correcting the direction of work, and properly carrying out the review and handling of historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution."
In this work, the major historical legacy issues that have had a significant impact and were directly reviewed and handled by the Party Central Committee, relevant departments of the central state organs, and entrusted by the central committee to certain provinces and cities, include the following cases:
(1) Review and correct wrongful convictions during the "Anti-Rightist Struggle." During the rectification process carried out throughout the Party in 1957, a few bourgeois rightists took the opportunity to advocate for the so-called "big democratic discussions" and launched an aggressive attack on the Party and the newly established socialist system, attempting to replace the leadership of the Communist Party. In this situation, the Party Central Committee decided to counterattack the rightist offensive, which was necessary and correct. However, the anti-rightist struggle was severely expanded, a group of intellectuals, patriots, and cadres were wrongly labeled as "rightists," resulting in unfortunate consequences. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "As the movement developed, it became too expansive, the scope of attack widened, and the blows were too heavy. Many people were indeed handled improperly, and the punishments were too severe. For many years, they suffered injustice and were unable to contribute their intelligence and talent to the people. This is not only their personal loss but also the loss of the entire country."
In 1959, the Party Central Committee issued instructions to gradually remove the hats of rightists in stages and batches. By 1964, the hats of rightists were removed for the majority of those who were wrongly labeled.
After the downfall of the "Gang of Four," the issues of rehabilitating wrongfully convicted individuals and implementing cadre policies, including removing the hats of rightists and correcting the problems, were raised again. Due to the prevailing "leftist" ideological constraints at that time and the incomplete denunciation of the "Cultural Revolution," it was very difficult to handle this issue properly and faced considerable obstacles and criticisms.
In the spring of 1978, relevant departments of the central state organs convened a meeting in Yantai, Shandong Province to discuss how to properly handle the historical legacy issues of the "Anti-Rightist Struggle." At the meeting, a consensus was reached on the issue of removing the hats of rightists, but opinions on correcting the wrongly labeled rightists were still not consistent. After the meeting, the United Front Work Department and the Ministry of Public Security drafted the "Request Report on Removing the Hats of Rightists in its Entirety" to be submitted to the central authorities. According to research approval, in April 1978, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee issued a notice titled "On Removing the Label of Rightist from All Rightist Elements", deciding to remove the labels of the remaining rightist elements.
Subsequently, at the suggestion of Hu Yaobang, the Central Organization Department wrote a report to the Central Committee, proposing to correct the mistakes made during the "anti-rightist" struggle based on seeking truth from facts and correcting errors when found. In August 1978, relevant departments of the central government held another meeting to specifically discuss the issue of correcting rightist mistakes. During the meeting, some people still insisted on only removing the labels without making corrections. Some people believed that the past disputes and controversies should be left behind and there was no need to settle them one by one. Today, as long as the labels are unifiedly removed and everyone is treated as members of the same group, it would be sufficient. Some believed that no matter what, each place and department should leave some "examples" and not make changes across the board. Some even said that if hundreds of thousands of rightists were all corrected, the entire party would be in chaos. Comrades who insisted on both removing the labels and correcting their views believed that it was necessary to adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting errors. They pointed out that only by correcting all wrongful, false, and mistaken cases could right from wrong be distinguished, unity be strengthened, and the development of the cause be promoted. After intense debates, the latter's opinions received the support of the majority of comrades present at the meeting.
In September 1978, based on the principle of seeking truth from facts, cracking down on opposition, and correcting mistakes, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approved and implemented the "Implementation Plan for Carrying out the Decision of the Central Committee on Removing the Labels of Rightist Elements" drafted by the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Public Security. A notice was issued, deciding to review and correct the cases of those who were mislabeled as rightist elements and rectify the wrongful labeling. This document provided guidance for resolving the lingering issues of the anti-rightist struggle and formulated basic policies and methods.
In order to carry out the work of removing the rightist labels and making corrections, the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly established the "Office for Removing Labels". The Central Organization Department also established an office specifically responsible for the correction of rightist mistakes. In order to promote the progress of this work, on January 4, 1979, the Central Organization Department published an article titled "The Correction of Rightist Mistakes Must Be Accelerated" in the 33rd issue of "Organizational Work Communication". The article provided a specific analysis of the situation regarding the correction of rightist mistakes, clarified some misunderstandings, and proposed concrete measures.
In order to withstand pressure and overcome resistance, the older generation of revolutionaries, represented by Deng Xiaoping, provided tremendous support for this work. Deng Xiaoping emphasized, "Removing the labels of all rightist elements, correcting the handling of the majority of them, and assigning them appropriate work is a necessary and significant political measure."
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the strong support of the older generation of revolutionaries, and the joint efforts of relevant departments of the central government, the solid ice that hindered the removal of rightist labels and the correction of wrongful labeling was finally broken through tireless and meticulous work.
In February 1979, the Central Organization Department and the Central United Front Work Department jointly held a national experience exchange meeting on the review and correction of rightists. The Central Party School, the Ministry of Public Security, the Yancheng County Committee in Henan Province, and other units introduced their experiences in liberating ideological thinking and carrying out successful reviews and corrections. The leaders of the Central Organization Department and the Central United Front Work Department also spoke at the meeting, emphasizing the significance of implementing the spirit of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and seeking truth from facts in dealing with historical legacy issues. For the first time, they raised the issue of the "excessive expansion" mistake made in the "anti-rightist" struggle in 1957, emphasizing that "correcting wrongly labeled rightists is correcting our mistakes in the 'anti-rightist' struggle." They emphasized that regardless of which level organization or individual approved the verdicts, all incorrect ones must be corrected. This was an experience exchange meeting and also a promotion conference for liberating ideological thinking. Subsequently, similar meetings were held in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, as well as districts and counties. Subsequently, in response to new situations and prominent contradictions in this work, the party center issued a notice on the policy issues of rectifying the placement and other follow-up work after the correction of the wrong labeling of rightists, which provided a thorough solution to the problems left over from the "anti-rightist" struggle. By the first half of 1981, this work had concluded successfully, with a total of over 540,000 people having their rightist problems corrected, accounting for over 98% of the original number of rightists. Of the 270,000 people who lost their public positions, they had their positions restored and were reassigned to work or resettled in their lives. Adjustments were also made to improper job arrangements. Additionally, the policies were implemented for over 315,000 people labeled as "centrist-rightists" and "counter-revolutionary elements," as well as for their affected relatives. The successful completion of this work not only "liberated" several hundred thousand comrades who had been wrongly labeled as rightists, but also relieved the pain of a larger number of affected family members and friends, stimulating their enthusiasm to build socialism.
(2) Review and rectification of unjust, false, and mistaken cases in the "anti-rightist" struggle. From July 2 to August 16, 1959, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held the expanded Political Bureau Meeting and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, known as the "Lushan Conference". In the later stages of the "Lushan Conference," an erroneous criticism of Peng Dehuai was launched, which led to the mistaken "anti-rightist" struggle throughout the Party. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee regarding the so-called "Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Xiaozhou anti-Party group" was completely mistaken. The resolution proposed transferring comrades such as Peng Dehuai from their positions in the Ministry of National Defense while retaining their positions as members of the Political Bureau for later observation. The plenary session also passed the resolution "Struggle to Defend the Party's General Line and Oppose Rightist Opportunism." The resolution stated that "rightist opportunism has become the main danger within the Party. Uniting the whole Party and the people of the whole country to defend the general line, repulse the attack of rightist opportunism, has become the Party's main battle task at present." Thus, the "anti-rightist" struggle was pushed throughout the entire Party. During the "anti-rightist" struggle, a large number of party members and cadres were subjected to erroneous criticism and punishment, and some comrades were mistakenly labeled as rightist opportunists. During the "Cultural Revolution," under the interference of extreme leftist trends, these comrades were again subjected to criticism, struggle, and various forms of punishment.
The "anti-rightist" struggle was a major mistake in the political life within our party after the establishment of the new China. It severely undermined the democratic life within the Party from the central to the grassroots level, wrongly attacked a large number of comrades who dared to seek truth from facts, reflect actual circumstances to the Party, and put forward critical opinions, supported the detrimental tendency of exaggeration and falsehood, and contributed to the development of the phenomenon of personality cult within the Party.
Although after the Seventh Thousand People's Congress in 1961 and 1962, the central authorities decided to review the individuals who had been identified as rightist opportunists (or rightist opportunism errors) since 1959, and conducted a considerable amount of work, many people had been vindicated and rectified. However, as the errors of "leftism" at that time were not fundamentally corrected, the rectification was not thorough. Later, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee, due to the proposal to counteract the tendency of right-wing overturning verdicts, this work was practically suspended. During the "Four Cleanups" campaign and the "Cultural Revolution" movement, under the interference of extreme leftist trends, many places reclassified individuals who had been vindicated and rectified in 1961 and 1962 as rightist opportunists or for their rightist opportunism errors, subjecting them to struggle; those who had not yet been vindicated and rectified were singled out for criticism, struggles, or disciplinary sanctions, with many people being expelled from the Party, the Communist Youth League, demoted, had their salaries reduced, sent down to the country, or had their public positions terminated, among other forms of punishment.
After the downfall of the "Gang of Four," at the beginning of rectifying unjust, false, and mistaken cases and implementing the cadre policies, some elderly comrades put forward suggestions and requests for exonerating comrades who had been wrongly criticized during the "anti-rightist" struggle. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee exonerated Peng Dehuai. In July 1979, the central authorities officially issued the "Notice on the Exoneration and Rectification of Individuals Labeled as Rightist Opportunists." The notice emphasizes that in the struggle against "rightist deviation" since 1959, those who were labeled as rightist opportunists or made rightist opportunistic mistakes due to reflecting the actual situation or expressing different opinions within the party, must all be rehabilitated and corrected, and various policies regarding political and living treatment must be implemented properly.
After the document was issued, according to the central deployment, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was responsible for and assisted by the Central Organization Department to promptly and properly handle the remaining issues in the "anti-rightist" movement.
(3) Review and correct the unjust, false, and mistaken cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign. The "Four Cleanups" campaign was a large-scale mass movement launched and led by the party. In February 1963, the Central Work Conference determined that a socialist education movement mainly focusing on "Four Cleanups" (cleaning up accounts, warehouses, finances, and work points) would be carried out universally in rural areas; and in cities, the "Five Anti" (anti-corruption and bribery, anti-speculation and profiteering, anti-waste, anti-decentralization, anti-bureaucracy) campaign would be launched. At the end of 1964 to early 1965, the Central Work Conference, presided over by Mao Zedong, discussed and formulated the "Some Issues Currently Put Forward in the Rural Socialist Education Movement," also known as the "23 Rules." In this document, the "Four Cleanups" were defined as political cleansing, economic cleansing, organizational cleansing, and ideological cleansing. It emphasized that the nature of this movement was to resolve the "contradiction between socialism and capitalism" and put forward a more "leftist" view, such as the focus of the movement being on "the power-holders within the party who take the capitalist road." Although the "Four Cleanups" campaign played a certain role in solving problems such as the work style of cadres and economic management, many grassroots cadres were unjustifiably affected due to considering problems of different natures as class struggle or as reflections of class struggle within the party. During the "Cultural Revolution," Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" took advantage of the chaos to further complicate this issue.
In May 1978, Li Jingquan, the former first secretary of the Southwest Bureau, submitted a report to the central government titled "The Situation of Remaining Issues in the 'Four Cleanups' Campaign in Guiyang City." Deng Xiaoping instructed, "Agree with this report. It seems that the Organization Department of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee should jointly study a policy and approach for handling this matter and report to the central government." In July of the same year, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee submitted a report titled "The Situation of Remaining Issues in the 'Four Cleanups' Campaign in Guiyang City and Recommendations for Handling" to the central government. In August, the Central Committee of the CPC replied and agreed to the report from the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee. The reply pointed out that in the "Four Cleanups" campaign in Guiyang, there were problems with the improper classification and handling of certain comrades, which mixed up contradictions of different natures and harmed some comrades. It emphasized the necessity of correcting this situation objectively and truthfully for the restoration and development of the party's fine traditions, the implementation of party policies, the mobilization of the enthusiasm of cadres and party members, and the strengthening of unity. Regarding the comrades who participated in the "Four Cleanups" work and those who were criticized or disciplined during the campaign, good work should be done without investigating individual responsibilities or personal grievances. We should unite and fight against the common enemy, and make new contributions to the development of a favorable situation in Guizhou. In the same month, an article titled "Errors in the 'Four Cleanups' Campaign Should Also Be Corrected" was published in Issue 12 of the "Organizational Work Newsletter." This article was written based on the spirit of the central government's reply to the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee's report on the Guiyang "Four Cleanups" issue. The article called for the objective correction of cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign that were indeed mishandled. It also addressed concerns such as whether correcting the mistaken cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign would overturn the achievements of the campaign or cause trouble. It further proposed that the correction of mistaken cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign must be carried out with a positive and cautious approach, focusing on both problem-solving and stabilizing the situation. Political solutions should be prioritized. Stability and unity should be promoted, and a favorable situation should be developed. Subsequently, the Central Organization Department put forward specific regulations and work requirements for the review and correction of unjust, false, and mistaken cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign. In accordance with the central government's spirit, local governments and departments across the country began to review and correct the mistaken cases in the "Four Cleanups" campaign.
In view of the significant differences and special characteristics of the "Four Clearings" movement in Guizhou in 1964 compared to the nationwide situation, in December 1983, the Guizhou Provincial Committee again submitted a request report to the Central Organization Department on "Thoroughly Resolving the Guizhou 'Four Clearings' Issue", once again requesting approval from the central government. Acting on behalf of the central government, the Central Organization Department drafted a reply (draft) to the Guizhou Provincial Committee on "Resolving the Guizhou 'Four Clearings' Issue", which was approved by the central government and replied to the Guizhou Provincial Committee in June 1984 in the name of the CPC Central Committee. The reply pointed out: "The 'Four Clearings' movement in Guizhou in 1964 was conducted under the guidance of a 'left' leaning erroneous ideology. The previous conclusion that the Provincial Committee had committed errors of a right-opportunist nature and that 'Guiyang Municipal Committee had formed a dual counterrevolutionary regime' was completely incorrect. It is completely correct to thoroughly redress the grievances, misconceptions, and wrongful cases caused by this. Based on the relevant regulations of the central government, the erroneous conclusions and documents related to the Guizhou 'Four Clearings' issue have become invalid on their own." "The central government believes that the provincial committee of Guizhou, the municipal committee of Guiyang, and the leading cadres in other localities where the 'Four Clearings' movement was carried out are good comrades. The two thousand cadres sent by the central government to participate in the 'Four Clearings' in Guizhou at that time are also good comrades. Currently, strengthening unity among cadres is of great significance for creating a new situation in Guizhou's work." Starting from this point, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government carried out comprehensive and thorough reexaminations and corrections of wrongful cases in the "Four Clearings" work based on the spirit of the central government. Nationwide, over 630,000 wrongful cases from the "Four Clearings" movement were reexamined and corrected.
(4) Properly handle the lingering issues of underground party history. In the early days of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, in the work of universally cleaning up underground party organizations, due to insufficient understanding of the complexity of underground struggles in some places, lack of knowledge about the historical environment and characteristics of underground struggles, and mistakes in work, some comrades of underground parties were subjected to incorrect treatment and unfair treatment, resulting in many lingering issues. During the "Cultural Revolution", some comrades of underground parties were also defamed and persecuted as a result. In July 1981, Hu Yaobang instructed in a letter, "We must handle the lingering issues of underground party history very well, solve them properly and fairly, and start with Fujian." The Central Organization Department sent a letter to the Fujian Provincial Committee and other relevant provincial committees, conveying Hu Yaobang's instruction. The Fujian Provincial Committee attached great importance to this issue. It was led by the Secretary of the Provincial Committee and took more than three years to thoroughly reexamine the historical lingering issues of underground parties in Fujian and handle them properly.
The Yunnan Provincial Committee also immediately started to address the lingering issues in Yunnan's work of clearing underground parties in accordance with the spirit of the instruction. In March 1982, the Central Organization Department issued the approved reports of the Yunnan Provincial Committee on "Resolving the Historical Lingering Issues of Underground Parties and 'Bian Zong' in Yunnan" and "Restoring the Political Reputation of Comrade Zheng Boke", respectively. All false accusations imposed on underground parties and "Bian Zong" by the Provincial Military Control Commission and Provincial Revolutionary Committee during the "Cultural Revolution" were thoroughly refuted, and a large number of wrongful cases were completely redressed. At the same time, inappropriate conclusions made about Yunnan underground parties and "Bian Zong" in several political movements before the "Cultural Revolution" were resolved, as were the erroneous criticisms of Zheng Boke, the main person in charge of Yunnan underground parties in the 1950s by the Provincial Committee. The contributions and achievements of Yunnan underground parties and "Bian Zong" in the remote multi-ethnic border areas, where they confronted arduous struggles far from the central government, were fully recognized. In August 1982, the Central Organization Department also approved and issued the report of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee Organization Department on the situation of the underground party organization of Northwest United University and the handling opinions on relevant personnel's party membership.
Based on a careful summary of the experience in properly handling the historical legacy of underground parties in the above-mentioned regions, the Central Organization Department held a symposium on dealing with the historical legacy of underground parties in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in December 1984. The work of dealing with the historical legacy of underground parties was seriously studied and deployed. After the meeting, with the approval of the Central Secretariat, the Central Organization Department issued a notice on the printing and distribution of the "Summary of the Symposium on Dealing with the Historical Legacy of Underground Parties" (referred to as the "Summary"). The "Summary" affirms the long-term heroic struggle of underground party organizations and underground party-led guerrilla forces in the white terror, and their contributions to the liberation cause of the Chinese people. It points out that the historical legacy of underground parties mainly refers to the underground party organizations established before the local liberation, or the guerrilla forces led by underground parties, secret peripheral organizations, and the issues such as false, exaggerated, and erroneous cases and the remaining party membership caused by incorrect handling. In dealing with these issues, we should follow the "Resolution on Several Historical Issues of the Party since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" and the relevant policies and instructions of the Central Committee, adhere to the principle of "seeking truth from facts, correcting mistakes", and solve them in a fair and just manner. We should not only distinguish right from wrong, solve problems, but also promote stability and unity. Personal responsibility should not be pursued. It is necessary to focus on solving the problems politically and provide appropriate remedies for comrades who have been subjected to incorrect handling for a long time in terms of political and living arrangements. The "Summary" also puts forward opinions on several issues in the work of dealing with the historical legacy of underground parties. After that, this work was widely carried out nationwide. In November 1985, the Central Organization Department issued a notice on "Accelerating the Handling of the Historical Legacy of Underground Parties", requiring the organization departments at all levels to continue to accelerate the work of handling the historical legacy of underground parties in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's policy implementation work before the Thirteenth National Congress; specific replies were given to the subsidy issues related to the living arrangements of underground party comrades who have been subjected to incorrect handling for a long time. 
With the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the joint efforts of the relevant provinces, cities, and districts, this work was basically completed before the Thirteenth National Congress. The historical legacy of underground parties was properly handled, the revolutionary image of underground parties was restored, right from wrong was clarified, and the unity of the Party was strengthened.
(5) Seriously implement the policies regarding intelligence and reconnaissance personnel. This is an important task in the later stage of rectifying false cases and implementing cadre policies. The intelligence and reconnaissance work of our party has played an important role in both the war period and the construction period. However, since the founding of New China, in various political movements, especially in the "Cultural Revolution", due to the influence of "leftist" ideology and work mistakes, the special situation of intelligence and reconnaissance work has been neglected, resulting in many intelligence and reconnaissance personnel and leading cadres being subjected to incorrect handling, causing many false, exaggerated, and erroneous cases. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, party organizations at all levels have rectified some false cases in intelligence and reconnaissance personnel and implemented the cadre policy work, especially the exoneration of Pan Hannian, who had been unjustly treated for many years, by the Central Committee, which has had a great impact. However, the historical legacy issues of intelligence and reconnaissance personnel are relatively complex. In some regions and departments, due to insufficient understanding of the policy, approach, and characteristics of our party's intelligence and reconnaissance work, as well as the lack of policy basis for handling the problems that occurred under specific conditions, the problems and follow-up work of some intelligence and reconnaissance personnel who have been subjected to incorrect handling have not been completely resolved.
In April 1986, the Party Group of the State Security Ministry and the Central Organization Department submitted a request for instructions to the Central Secretariat on the implementation of the policy regarding intelligence and reconnaissance personnel. The Central Secretariat instructed that the implementation of the policy regarding intelligence and reconnaissance personnel is a serious political task, and localities and relevant departments should seriously and promptly implement it. In implementing the policy, the special nature of intelligence work should be fully considered. Based on the policies and strategies of our party's struggle against enemies at different periods, closely combining the historical environment and actual conditions at that time, a pragmatic and comprehensive analysis should be carried out. Regarding specific issues, they should be handled with the principle of being broad rather than detailed and lenient rather than strict. In May of the same year, with the approval of the central government, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee forwarded this request report. In July, the Ministry of State Security and the Central Organization Department jointly held a symposium in Beijing on the implementation of policies for intelligence and investigation personnel by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The focus of the symposium was to study the implementation of the instructions from the central government and the notice from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee regarding the implementation of policies for intelligence and investigation personnel, further deepen the understanding of the importance of doing this work well, clarify the principles and guiding ideology for this work, as well as the measures that should be taken, and make corresponding work arrangements. After the symposium, the work of implementing policies for intelligence and investigation personnel was comprehensively launched in 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, as well as in central state organs.
All provinces and municipalities attached great importance to this work, and some provinces even established dedicated organizations to undertake this work. However, due to the uniqueness, complexity, and arduousness of implementing policies for intelligence and investigation personnel, this work was not completely finished until the early 1990s. In total, thousands of people and cases were rectified, and significant achievements were made in the implementation of policies for intelligence and investigation personnel.
This nationwide rectification of wrongly accused cases and the implementation of policies for intelligence and investigation personnel were unprecedented in the history of intelligence and investigation work, and the results were remarkable. It fully embodies the party's concern for intelligence and investigation personnel and a thoroughly responsible spirit, relieving comrades and their families from years of heavy burdens. It played a positive role in winning over friends, uniting comrades, mobilizing the enthusiasm of comrades in the intelligence and investigation front, enhancing cohesion, and promoting the development of national security undertakings.
(6) The exoneration of the novel "Liu Zhidan". At the 1962 Beidaihe Central Work Conference and the 10th Plenary Session of the 8th CPC Central Committee, due to Kang Sheng's initiation, the unpublished novel "Liu Zhidan" was criticized. After the conference, writing this novel was treated as a counter-revolutionary incident within the party and underwent a long-term special case review involving the novel itself, the author Li Jiantong, the readers of the manuscript Xijongxun and Liu Jingfan, as well as comrades from the worker publishing house who organized the creation of this novel. The special case review had not been concluded by the start of the "Cultural Revolution". During the "Cultural Revolution", Kang Sheng, together with Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four", conducted larger-scale political persecution on the issue of the novel "Liu Zhidan". Yao Wenyuan published an article publicly declaring that "Liu Zhidan" was a counter-revolutionary novel and claimed that the author and comrades who supported the book were anti-party elements. After that, comrades who had undergone the special case review suffered even more severe persecution, and more people were implicated. Leaders who had read the manuscript and supported this creation, a group of old cadres and party members from the former Shaanxi-Gansu Revolutionary Base, and even some comrades who participated in the special case review work, all suffered varying degrees of persecution, with some being driven to death. Li Jiantong was designated as a "key figure in the Xi Zhongxun counter-revolutionary group using the novel to engage in anti-party activities". Until May 1977, in the review conclusion made by the central task force for Liu Jingfan, it still mentioned that Liu Jingfan "colluded with Xi Zhongxun to publish the anti-party novel 'Liu Zhidan' and vindicate Gao Gang".
After the reexamination by the Central Organization Department in 1979, it was elucidated that the novel "Liu Zhidan" (as reviewed in the sample book) was not only not a counter-revolutionary novel but also a relatively good novel that extolled the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries and depicted the history of revolutionary struggles. It was completely legitimate for comrades like Xi Zhongxun to be concerned about the creation of this novel and to express their opinions on how to improve it. It was by no means a conspiracy by an anti-party group. Looking at the process before and after the case, the so-called case of using the novel "Liu Zhidan" to engage in anti-party activities was a major erroneous case created by Kang Sheng. It was an even wider-ranging modern literary inquisition intensified by Kang Sheng collaborating with Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" during the "Cultural Revolution". Therefore, in August 1979, the Central Committee forwarded the report from the Central Organization Department titled "Regarding the Exoneration of the Novel 'Liu Zhidan'". By publishing articles in newspapers and clarifying the truth, all comrades who have been falsely accused are cleared of charges and their names restored. The aftermath work is done well, resulting in a just resolution of this major wrong and winning people's hearts.
(7) Conduct a thorough review and reversal of the so-called "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique". The so-called "Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, Xi Zhongxun anti-party clique" was fabricated by Kang Sheng during the special case review of Xi Zhongxun after the 10th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. He used his authority to issue instructions, randomly naming people and carrying out a series of activities to expose and criticize the "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique". In 1965, the "Guidelines for Conveying the Issue of Xi Zhongxun's Anti-Party Activities", which was approved by Kang Sheng, was distributed and conveyed among cadres at all levels, aiming to thoroughly eliminate the "harmful influence of Peng, Gao, Xi". As a result, not only Peng Dehuai and Xi Zhongxun were falsely accused and persecuted, but also a group of comrades who had worked with them were implicated.
During the "Cultural Revolution", Kang Sheng, along with Lin Biao, the "Gang of Four", and their proxies in Shaanxi, further intensified the so-called "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique" issue. They claimed that there was a serious enemy situation in Shaanxi, and that Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, and Xi Zhongxun used Xi'an in Shaanxi as their rear base. Under the pretext of "purging", they carried out activities such as "investigation of the black line" and "digging out the black roots", accusing the original Northwest Bureau, Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Council, Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, and Municipal People's Council of being "five black nests" and regarding them as the "old forces" of Peng, Gao, Xi, all of which were to be "thoroughly smashed". They imprisoned more than fifty leading cadres from the Northwest Bureau, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, fabricated charges, and subjected them to fascist persecution.
In 1979, through a re-examination by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, the term "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique" was found to be extremely absurd and purely a false accusation, resulting in many wrongful cases, damaging and influencing the work in Shaanxi. Although Peng Dehuai has been cleared of charges and Xi Zhongxun's issue has been resolved, considering that the so-called "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique" issue has widespread implications in Shaanxi and has a significant impact, with strong reflections from various aspects, the Communist Party of China Shaanxi Provincial Committee believes that it is still necessary to solemnly announce a complete exoneration and restoration for this false case. In January 1980, with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Organization Department of the Central Committee forwarded the "Report on the Request for a Thorough Exoneration of the so-called "Peng, Gao, Xi anti-party clique" Issue" from the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling for comprehensive and complete exoneration of this false case.
(8) Properly resolve the issue of wrongfully killed personnel during the rectification campaigns in the Soviet areas. The problem of personnel wrongfully killed during the rectification campaigns in the Soviet areas is a major historical legacy issue that has a wide impact and involves a large number of people. From 1930 to 1935, under the influence of the "Left" deviationist line, several major Soviet areas, including the Central Soviet Area, Xiang-Gan-Xi, He-Yu-Wan, Min-Xi, Chuan-Shan, and Shan-Gan, successively carried out movements to eliminate the "8th Route Army Faction", "reorganize faction", "Social Democratic Party", "Third Party", "Cancellation Faction", and others. Many comrades were wrongly arrested and killed. In the resolution "On Several Historical Issues" adopted at the 7th Plenary Session of the 6th Central Committee of the Party in 1945, it was clearly pointed out: "Due to the entanglement of sectarianism in the wrong rectification policy and cadre policy, a large number of excellent comrades were wrongly handled and falsely accused, resulting in extremely heartbreaking losses within the Party." "Comrades who have been falsely accused due to the wrong handling of the investigation should be cleared of charges, have their party membership restored, and be memorialized by their comrades." However, due to the limitations of historical conditions at that time, this issue had not been resolved before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. After the establishment of New China, in 1954, the central government proposed opinions on dealing with this issue. The Central People's Government issued the Notice on the Handling of the Issue of Wrongful Killing of Anti-Counterrevolutionaries and Their Families during the Second Revolutionary War Period, according to the spirit of the notice, nearly 20,000 people were rehabilitated in provinces such as Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hubei. Other provinces also rehabilitated the main party, government, and military leaders who were wrongly killed, but the problems of the majority of the people have not been solved. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, many relatives of the wrongfully killed personnel and some old comrades repeatedly demanded a thorough solution to this historical legacy problem. Central leadership comrades instructed the Organization Department of the Central Committee and the Ministry of Civil Affairs to study and propose handling methods. In March and June 1983, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council approved two opinions on handling this issue, and the State Council forwarded the Notice on the Handling of the Problem of Wrongly Killed Personnel in the Anti-Counterrevolutionary Campaign during the Second Revolutionary Civil War period issued by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The organization departments and civil affairs departments of Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other relevant provinces closely cooperated and conducted in-depth and meticulous review work.
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the efforts of the relevant provinces and cities, after three years of hard work, the false cases in the anti-counterrevolutionary campaign in the Soviet Area were thoroughly rehabilitated and the post-mortem issues of those who were wrongly killed or wrongly handled were properly handled, thus thoroughly solving this major historical legacy problem that had dragged on for decades.
(9) The famous generals Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue, who participated in the Ningdu Uprising, were rehabilitated. In June 1979, 12 old comrades including Ji Pengfei, Li Da, Huang Zhen, Wang Youping, Yuan Xuezu, and Su Jin wrote a letter to the central government, reflecting that Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue, who were originally members of the Red Fifth Army Corps, were wrongly killed in 1934 and proposed rehabilitation and restoration of their reputations. In accordance with the instructions of the central leadership comrades, the Organization Department of the Central Committee sent personnel to investigate more than 70 old comrades and reviewed relevant archival materials. Ji Zhentong was originally the commander of the 74th Brigade of the 25th Division of the Nationalist Party's 26th Route Army, and Huang Zhongyue was the commander of one regiment of the brigade. On December 14, 1931, they led their troops to participate in the "Ningdu Uprising" led by CCP member Zhao Bosheng and important commander Dong Zhentang, which shook the whole country. After more than 10,000 soldiers and officers rebelled, they were organized into the Red Fifth Army Corps, and Ji Zhentong was admitted as a special CCP member and appointed as the commander of the corps, while Huang Zhongyue was appointed as the commander of the 15th Army. In the spring of 1932, the National Security Bureau discovered the defection activities led by a few officers headed by Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue, accusing them of counterrevolutionary activities and imprisoning them. Later, influenced by Wang Ming's "left" sectarian line, they were executed on the eve of the Long March. Comrade Ye Jianying commented on this case: "I heard Chairman Mao say (in Yan'an, I think) that the killing of Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue was a mistake, and now I think this unjust case should be redressed." From the results of the review by the Organization Department, Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue made contributions and had a significant influence during the Ningdu Uprising, which should be affirmed. Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue themselves had patriotic and anti-Japanese thoughts. We have admitted Ji as a special CCP member and decided that he will go to the Soviet Union for study, and we still trust him politically. He Yingqin had sent people to contact Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue for defection, although Ji and Huang did not report their contact with the organization, the enemy's defection conspiracy did not succeed, and it is believable that Ji said he could not pull the team away from the Soviet Area. It was a mistake to label Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue as counterrevolutionaries, and it was even more wrong to execute them. They should be rehabilitated, their reputations should be restored, and Ji's party membership should be restored. In August 1981, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee approved the Report from the Organization Department of the Central Committee on the Issue of Rehabilitating Comrades Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue from the Red Fifth Army Corps. The contributions made by Ji Zhentong and Huang Zhongyue during the uprising were appropriately evaluated. In this way, this unjust case that lasted for nearly half a century was finally resolved fairly and reasonably.
(10) Completely overturn the "Suto Incident" in Huxi. The "Suto Incident" in Huxi occurred between August and November 1939, starting and developing from the local committee by the lake, and then expanding to the entire Sulu-Yu border area. In this incident, a large number of cadres were arrested and killed, resulting in extremely severe losses. In November 1939, Luo Ronghuan, Guo Hongtao, and other leaders of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rushed to Huxi and took emergency measures to stop the development of this incident. From 1940 to 1945, the Central Committee and the Shandong Branch conducted several reviews and affirmatively identified Wang Xuren, the former Minister of the Organizational Department of the former Hubei Provincial Committee, as the primary instigator of the "Suto Incident" with unclear origins. However, due to the limitations of the historical conditions at that time, an exact conclusion on the nature of the incident was not made, resulting in many unresolved issues. The family members of some martyrs were once again labeled as "counterrevolutionaries" during the Cultural Revolution. Based on the instructions from the central authorities regarding the overturning of wrongful, false, and mistaken cases, the Shandong Provincial Committee reviewed this historical wrongful case again. In May 1983, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CCP submitted a report to the central authorities entitled "Opinions on Handling the Remaining Issues of the 'Suto Incident' in Huxi," stating that this case was not an issue of amplification. The "Suto Movement" in 1939, aimed at eliminating "Trotskyist elements" and "Trotskyist organizations," had no factual basis. The original identification of the seven so-called "real Trotskyist bandits" was thoroughly investigated, and it was found that not one of them was genuine. This is a significant case of wrongful accusations, false charges, and mistaken handling, which should be thoroughly overturned. The comrades who were mistakenly killed or wrongly handled should all be completely exonerated and vindicated. The family members and children who suffered from the consequences should be thoroughly vindicated and the impacts eliminated. With the central approval, the Central Organization Department forwarded the report from the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CCP entitled "Opinions on Handling the Remaining Issues of the 'Suto Incident' in Huxi" in December 1983, finally completely overturning this long-standing wrongful case.
(11) Completely overturn the so-called "Trotskyist cases" of the New Fourth Army's Fourth Division and the Huabei and Huainan bases in 1941. In October 1984, the Central Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army made a decision entitled "Decision on Completely Overturning the So-called 'Trotskyist Cases' of the New Fourth Army's Fourth Division and the Huabei and Huainan Bases in 1941." The decision pointed out that the CCP branch of the Guangxi Student Army, from its establishment in May 1938 to its retreat to the Huainan and Huabei bases in March 1940, had directly operated under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial Committee, the Eyuwan Area Party Committee, and the Lihuang City Committee. They actively mobilized and organized the masses, persisted in the anti-Japanese resistance behind enemy lines, propagated the CCP's policy of a united front against Japan, and advocated anti-Japanese political ideas. They also protected the underground party leadership organs and made beneficial contributions. The CCP members and progressive masses from the Guangxi Student Army who joined the New Fourth Army and the Huainan and Huabei bases had actively contributed to the armed resistance against Japan and the construction of the base areas. The baseless accusation of the CCP branch of the Guangxi Student Army as a "Trotskyist organization" and the unjustified investigation of dozens of comrades under the pretext of the "Trotskyist problem" constituted a complete miscarriage of justice. In order to eliminate the influence of this historical wrongful case, it is hereby decided to completely exonerate and restore the reputation of the CCP branch of the Guangxi Student Army and all comrades who were investigated and wrongly handled or executed in this case. The relevant regional and unit party organizations should, in accordance with the relevant regulations of the central authorities, carefully review the archival materials and carry out post-work.
(12) Properly handle the lingering historical issues of the "Central Plains Breakout." In August 1980, Zheng Shaowen, Zhang Zhiyi, and others wrote to the Party Central Committee, requesting a practical and realistic resolution to the lingering issues of the "Central Plains Breakout." Hu Yaobang made important instructions on the letter, demanding that the relevant departments handle it properly.
In 1946, our Central Plains troops and the party and government organs of the Central Plains Liberation Area, surrounded by the Kuomintang's 300,000 troops, carried out a strategic transfer - a breakout. Due to a very desperate situation during the breakout, in order to preserve our strength, the original Central Plains Bureau of the CCP formulated some special policies and mobilized a large number of comrades who could not breakout with the army to return to civilian life and hide. In the process of the breakout, many comrades were separated or got dispersed. Some of them, due to issues such as demobilization, concealment, and falling behind, have not only failed to receive proper resolution in matters such as party membership, participation in revolutionary work, and historical conclusions, but have also been treated unfairly. On May 29, 1957, Comrades Zheng Weisan, former Secretary of the Central Plains Bureau, and Chen Shaomin, former Minister of Organization, wrote a letter to the Central Organization Department, explaining the situation in detail. The letter stated: Before the breakout in the Central Plains in 1946, the situation was already very urgent. A large number of local cadres could not move with the army, so to preserve our strength, we made the following decisions at the time: disguise with the use of social relationships as much as possible to go to other liberated areas; for those who cannot disguise, utilize social relationships to conceal their identity; if discovered by the enemy and unable to conceal, surrender to the enemy as a soldier of the New Fourth Army or as a member of the Agricultural Association, as long as their identity as a Party member is not exposed, surrendering with the identity of a Party member will be treated differently. This decision was made in special difficult circumstances, and we take responsibility if this decision was wrong. The Central Organization Department forwarded this letter to the Hubei and Henan provincial committees for handling, asking them to pay attention to the situation mentioned in the letter when dealing with the issue of Party members surrendering in the Central Plains Liberation Area. However, at that time, it did not receive the attention it deserved. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when dealing with the historical legacy of the "Central Plains Breakout," some comrades did not consider the historical background and specific analysis enough, resulting in overly strict handling, especially during the "Cultural Revolution," some comrades suffered further mistreatment and the handling of their cases intensified.
According to the instructions of the leading comrades of the central government, the Organization Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee and the Party Committee of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department conducted a thorough investigation into the historical legacy of the "Central Plains Breakout" issue. They put forward the "Opinions on Dealing with the Historical Legacy of Personnel who Disbanded, Concealed, and Fell Behind During the Central Plains Breakout," stating that for the historical legacy of personnel who disbanded, concealed, and fell behind during the Central Plains Breakout, they should be dealt with in accordance with the basic principles of the Central Organization Department's opinions on thoroughly rectifying false cases and further implementing cadre policies issued on February 19, 1981, as well as the letter of Comrades Zheng Weisan and Chen Shaomin that was forwarded by the Central Organization Department on June 6, 1957. In line with the principle of "seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes," their problems should be seriously addressed through a thorough review, adopting a proactive and cautious attitude to properly resolve the issue. Regulations were also made regarding the handling of cases related to Party membership, work arrangements, retirement, and calculation of work participation time that were previously handled incorrectly, as well as the treatment of disbanded soldiers and the issue of posthumous recognition. In July 1981, the Central Organization Department forwarded the "Opinions on Dealing with the Historical Legacy of Personnel who Disbanded, Concealed, and Fell Behind During the Central Plains Breakout" from the Organization Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee and the Party Committee of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department. Relevant provinces, cities, and departments quickly organized reviews and corrections. Through this review and correction, more than 50,000 cases of personnel who disbanded, concealed, or fell behind were resolved, correcting the cases mishandled in the early days of New China’s establishment and properly resolving this historical legacy issue.
(13) Properly handle the historical legacy issue of the unidentified martyrs who were killed in the "China-America Cooperation Institute" prison on the eve of the liberation of Chongqing. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China entrusted the Organization Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee to re-investigate and verify the issue of unidentified martyrs who were killed in the "China-America Cooperation Institute" prison on the eve of the liberation of Chongqing. The Organization Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee organized a thorough investigation and clarified the situation of 83 people. The Party organizations reached a pragmatic conclusion on each of them. Among them, Xie Mazhao, Zhang Luping, and others, 64 people in total, resolutely upheld the noble character of a Communist Party member, bravely struggled, were unwavering and unyielding, and met their deaths calmly, demonstrating deeds that are worthy of praise and admiration and serve as models for future generations. They were posthumously recognized as revolutionary martyrs. This historical legacy issue, which was delayed for more than thirty years, was finally resolved relatively properly. On November 20, 1986, Xinhua News Agency also made a special report on this matter.
The handling of the above-mentioned significant historical legacy issues has promoted the progress of properly resolving historical legacy issues nationwide. Each province, city, autonomous region, and ministry has also conducted a review and clearance of historical issues in their respective areas and departments, properly handling a large number of historical legacy issues. According to incomplete statistics, nearly two million cases of historical legacy issues before the "Cultural Revolution" have been reviewed and resolved nationwide. By the time of the 13th Party Congress in 1987, the work of properly handling historical legacy issues at the national level was basically completed. Through the proper handling of historical legacy issues, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been greatly mobilized, social stability and unity have been promoted, unjust, false and wrong cases have been corrected, cadre policies have been implemented, and the successful completion of this work before the 13th Party Congress has been ensured.
III. Reasonably adjust social relationships in the new situation
While reversing unjust, false, and wrong cases on a large scale, the Party Central Committee has also pragmatically studied and addressed some historical legacy issues, adjusted social relationships, and implemented policies in various aspects.
1. Fully implement policies for intellectuals and solve their practical problems
Implementing policies for intellectuals is an important part of reversing unjust, false, and wrong cases and implementing cadre policies. It runs through the entire process of reversing unjust, false, and wrong cases and implementing cadre policies, starting from 1978 and continuing until the successful completion before the 13th Party Congress in 1987.
Intellectuals in our country have a fine tradition of patriotism. Under the long-term education of the Party, the vast majority of intellectuals support the leadership of the Communist Party of China and love the socialist motherland. However, due to the "left" bias and discrimination against intellectuals that has formed over a long period of time, intellectuals have been affected to varying degrees in previous political movements. During the "Cultural Revolution", many intellectuals suffered severe repression and persecution once again.
After the downfall of the "Gang of Four", in March 1978, Deng Xiaoping delivered an important speech at the National Scientific Congress, clarifying the basic principles of Marxism regarding the position and role of science and technology in social development. He pointed out that intellectual workers who serve socialism are part of the working people and emphasized the necessity of cultivating a grand scientific and technological team in our country. Deng Xiaoping's discourse on intellectuals being part of the working people greatly inspired the enthusiasm of intellectuals to love the Party and construct the socialist motherland, and also cleared obstacles and indicated the direction for the large-scale implementation of policies for intellectuals.
From October to November 1978, the Communist Party of China Central Committee organized a symposium on the implementation of policies for intellectuals. The meeting believed that the situation of the intellectual ranks had undergone profound changes, and the policy of "unity, education, and transformation" towards intellectuals proposed during the early days of the founding of the country was no longer applicable to the current situation. It is necessary to do a good job in implementing policies for intellectuals. On November 3rd, the Organization Department issued a notice entitled "Several Opinions on Implementing the Party's Policies for Intellectuals", which put forward six requirements for the implementation of policies for intellectuals: first, there should be a correct estimation of the intellectual ranks; second, continue to do well in reviewing and correcting unjust, false, and wrong cases; third, fully trust, empower, and hold accountable intellectuals; fourth, adjust positions according to abilities, making the best use of talents; fifth, strive to improve working and living conditions; sixth, strengthen leadership and improve work style. After the issuance of the document, the work of implementing policies for intellectuals on a large scale gradually unfolded nationwide, and a social trend of respecting knowledge and talents gradually emerged.
Hu Yaobang paid great attention to this work and devoted a lot of effort to it. He made many important instructions to address the problems encountered in implementing policies for intellectuals. Based on a series of instructions from Hu Yaobang and the requirement of the central government to basically complete the rectification of false cases before the 13th National Congress, the Central Organization Department, together with relevant departments, vigorously implemented the inspection, supervision, and finalization of the policy for intellectuals, making it one of the key tasks of the Central Organization Department during this period.
In May 1985, the Central Organization Department and the United Front Work Department also jointly held a national symposium on the implementation of policies for intellectuals, focusing on how to complete the tasks of implementing policies for intellectuals before the 13th National Congress, as pointed out by the central authorities. The establishment of a responsibility system at various levels was proposed. The leading organs at all levels, especially comrades from the organization departments, should personally go to the grassroots level to supervise and inspect, assist in solving difficult problems, and solidly carry out the implementation of policies for intellectuals.
In September 1986, with the approval of the central leadership comrades, the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on inspecting the implementation of policies for intellectuals. It pointed out that the task of implementing policies for intellectuals and resolving historical issues has been basically completed in some regions and departments, and most regions and departments have planned to complete it in the second half of the year. In order to ensure the quality and successful completion of the work, it was required to conduct a serious inspection of units that have basically completed the tasks and specific requirements were provided for the scope and content of the inspection, organizational leadership, and steps and methods. In November, the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China held three batches of national symposiums on the exchange of experiences in implementing policies for intellectuals in Dalian, Wuhan, and Beijing, respectively. According to statistics from 25 provinces (regions, cities), various types of issues involving over 7.1 million people were resolved in the implementation of policies for intellectuals.
These measures and efforts greatly promoted the deep development of the implementation of policies for intellectuals. With the warm care of the central leadership and the joint efforts of various regions and departments, this great project that had undergone numerous challenges was finally basically completed before the 13th National Congress of the Party.
2. Lifting the labels of landlord and bourgeois peasant elements and resolving the issue of children from landlord and bourgeois peasant families
On January 11, 1979, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Regulations on the Work of Rural People's Communes (Trial Draft)" adopted based on the principles of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision on lifting the labels of landlord and bourgeois peasant elements and resolving the issue of children from landlord and bourgeois peasant families (referred to as the "Decision"). The "Decision" declared that those landlords, bourgeois peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements who have followed government laws for many years, worked honestly, and refrained from doing bad things, after undergoing mass evaluation and approval by the county revolutionary committee, will have their labels removed and be granted the status of rural people's commune members. The individuals from landlord and bourgeois peasant families were all classified as rural people's commune members and enjoyed the same treatment as other members. In the future, their admission to schools, enrollment in the military, joining the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party, and job assignments should primarily consider their political performance and discrimination should not be allowed. The children from landlord and bourgeois peasant families should be classified as commune members and should no longer be classified based on their family backgrounds. The "Decision" also required that extensive study of the Party's policies and ideological education should be carried out from within the Party to outside the Party.
This decision ended the discriminatory political situation for at least 20 million people and allowed them to enjoy the rights of citizens, starting a new political life. According to Xinhua News Agency, by November 1984, the final batch of work to remove the labels of landlord, bourgeois peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements was successfully completed nationwide. Correction was also made for those who were wrongly categorized. All four types of individuals who had already left the country or gone abroad had their labels removed, and their families were notified.
3. Restoration of the laborer identity of former business owners
On November 12, 1979, the Communist Party of China issued a report titled "Regarding the Distinction of Laborers from Business Owners in the Original Industrial and Commercial Sector," which was approved by the Central Committee and several other departments including the United Front Work Department. The report explicitly stated that during the implementation of public-private partnerships in the private industrial and commercial sector in 1956, a large number of small business owners, vendors, craftsmen, and other laborers were brought into the state-owned enterprises. They were collectively referred to as private personnel and treated as capitalist industrial and commercial owners, which was inappropriate. They should be distinguished from the original capitalist industrial and commercial owners and have their true identity as laborers clarified. In accordance with the spirit of this document, after more than a year of work, over seven hundred thousand small traders, vendors, craftsmen, and other laborers were distinguished from the original industrial and commercial owners, restoring their status as laborers. This effectively resolved the historical issues left over from the socialist transformation and corrected the mistakes made at that time. While carrying out this distinction work in various regions, according to the specific policies on original industrial and commercial owners provided by the Central Committee, the labels of capitalists or capitalist agents were also removed from them.
4. Resolving the issue of restrictions on the historical use of certain cadres
In the latter stages of rectifying wrong, false, and mistaken cases and implementing cadre policies, the Organization Department of the Central Committee conducted a systematic review of specialized documents related to cadre reviews issued since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It modified or abolished those documents influenced by "leftist" thinking or no longer applicable due to changes in circumstances. For cadres who had been wrongly treated, reexaminations and corrections were conducted to resolve a number of long-standing issues related to restrictions on their historical use.
The practice of imposing restrictions on the use of certain cadres was a special method adopted by our party to adapt to the war era and specific circumstances in cadre utilization. During the war era and the early stages of the People's Republic of China, due to objective limitations, it was difficult to immediately ascertain the political history or social relations of some cadres, and definite conclusions could not be drawn. Therefore, in terms of their assignment, the party organization placed them in minor positions and exercised appropriate control to facilitate ongoing assessments. This temporary measure was necessary at the time. However, this method did not change in a timely manner in the long period after the founding of the People's Republic of China; on the contrary, it continued. During the "Cultural Revolution," this method was abused by some localities and units, and arbitrary conclusions of restrictions on the use of certain comrades were made, severely undermining the enthusiasm of some cadres and the masses. On February 1, 1979, the 38th issue of "Organization Work Communication" published an article titled "Conclusions About Not Arbitrarily Imposing 'Controlled Use' on Cadres." The article pointed out that almost thirty years had passed since the nationwide liberation, and through multiple political campaigns and organizational reviews, some comrades had already been thoroughly cleared of any issues. For those comrades who, despite having certain problems, had consistently performed well after long-term assessments, the suspicions of the organization should be removed, the conclusions of "controlled use" should be lifted politically, and they should be trusted based on their moral and talent conditions and be boldly utilized. It explicitly stated that in the future, conclusions of "controlled use" on cadres would generally not be made. Only for the extremely rare individuals whose unrestricted use could potentially harm the socialist cause, necessary controls would be imposed. However, until their issues were thoroughly clarified, for those who possessed special skills, their roles should be developed according to the circumstances, and education and assessments should continue during their utilization. With the deepening of rectifying wrong, false, and mistaken cases and the implementation of cadre policies, in October 1983, with the approval of the CPC Central Secretariat, the Organization Department of the Central Committee issued the "Opinions on Resolving the Issue of Restrictions on the Historical Use of Certain Cadres." The document pointed out that before and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, during the rectification of cadres and the struggle against counterrevolutionaries, the Central Committee and the Organization Department had implemented regulations imposing restrictions on the use of cadres with political or historical issues. At that time, these regulations were necessary given the historical conditions. However, after undergoing long-term revolutionary struggles and tests, the majority of these cadres had performed well and very well. Some comrades had even made significant contributions to the Party and the people. In order to make rational use of cadres and fully unleash their positive roles in the construction of the Four Modernizations, the original regulations needed to be changed.
To carry out this work effectively, in September 1984, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee forwarded the pilot work report on resolving the issue of restrictions on the historical use of certain cadres from the Changchun Municipal Committee and the Nongan County Committee's Office for Cadre Review. In September 1986, the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) submitted a request to the central leadership titled "Regarding the Change of Restrictions on the Use of Forty-One Cadres at or above the Deputy Ministerial Level." This request was approved by the comrades of the central leadership. The document pointed out that based on the relevant provisions of the approved opinions of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee in July 1981 on changing the restrictions on the use of cadres who made mistakes after being arrested or captured, as well as the opinions in October 1983 on lifting the restrictions on the use of some cadres with historical limitations, a comprehensive review was conducted regarding the original restrictions on the use of 41 comrades, and the restrictions were lifted, canceled, or relieved, depending on the circumstances. The provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and central state organs, as well as various ministries and commissions, actively and steadily carried out this work according to the suggestions of the central leadership and in accordance with their cadre management authority. Before the 13th National Congress of the CPC, the work of lifting the restrictions on the use of some cadres with historical limitations was basically completed.
5. Implementing the Party's ethnic and religious policies
From 1980 to 1981, the Central Secretariat of the CPC successively held conferences in Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and regions to conscientiously address issues related to implementing the Party's ethnic policies. The central and some local party committees also removed the label of "local nationalist" from comrades.
In March 1982, the Central Secretariat of the CPC issued a document on religious issues during the socialist period, clarifying the Party's basic principles and policies on religious matters. Prior to and after this, the activities of patriotic religious organizations were restored, temples and monasteries were gradually restored and opened in various places, and the Party's religious policies were implemented.
6. Implementing policies for foreign experts and friendly individuals working in China
In September 1981, a foreign expert working in China wrote a letter to the comrades of the central leadership, requesting a modification of the review conclusion. After studying the matter, the leaders of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee suggested conducting a comprehensive review of the implementation policy for foreign expert friends and submitting a proposed solution to the Central Secretariat for unified consideration and approval. The central leadership agreed and instructed: "The request of this foreign expert is reasonable and should be thoroughly vindicated without leaving any traces. A comprehensive review and handling of the implementation policy for foreign friends is completely necessary."
In accordance with the instructions of the comrades of the central leadership, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Public Security reevaluated the conclusions regarding this foreign expert and the conclusions of Epstein and Qiu Moli, who had worked at the Foreign Languages Bureau, as well as the British expert Shapiro, who had worked at Xinhua News Agency, and the British expert Koruk, who had worked at the Foreign Language Institute. The policies were implemented accordingly. The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Public Security also made inquiries to the State Foreign Experts Bureau and other units regarding the implementation of policies for foreign experts. According to the investigations, most of these units have conducted a comprehensive review and vindication of the foreign experts who were affected during the "Cultural Revolution." Their reputations have been restored, salaries have been paid, and they have been assigned jobs. However, there are still many issues that need to be seriously resolved.
Therefore, the Party Group of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Party Group of the Ministry of Public Security submitted a report to the central leadership titled "Report on the Implementation of Policies for Foreign Expert Friends." It affirmed the significant contributions made by foreign experts in China's revolution and construction, pointing out that they should be respected by our Party and the people of the whole country. It required relevant units to conduct a comprehensive inspection and review of the implementation policy issues concerning foreign expert friends, and promptly resolve any problems and eliminate adverse influences. For experts who were harmed during the "Cultural Revolution," they should be completely vindicated politically, receive sufficient care in their lives, and receive enthusiastic support in their work. The series of guidelines and policies for implementing the cadre policies of our Party should be fully implemented and carefully applied to foreign expert friends, taking their characteristics into consideration. In March 1982, the Central Secretariat of the CPC forwarded the report from the Party Groups of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Public Security. After the issuance of the document, relevant units conducted a comprehensive review and orderly handling of the implementation policy issues concerning foreign experts working in China. This eliminated the adverse influences, enabling foreign experts and friendly individuals working in China to serve the socialist modernization construction of our country with peace of mind and restored our reputation internationally.
This national exoneration of wrong and false cases, the adjustment of social relations, and the implementation of various policies is unprecedented in the history of our party in terms of duration, scope, and scale, and the problem-solving is relatively thorough. The resolution of the aforementioned historical legacy issues and the implementation of various party policies have effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of all sectors of society, consolidated and developed the patriotic united front, and played a significant role in promoting the ideological liberation of the entire party, promoting the comprehensive rectification of the organizational front, consolidating and developing a stable and united political situation, ensuring socialist modernization, and realizing the great cause of national reunification.
IV. Restoration of the Party's Ethnic and Religious Policies
During the "Cultural Revolution," as in other areas, ethnic and religious work suffered serious damage and restrictions from "left-wing" guiding ideologies. Ethnic and religious institutions were abolished, and ethnic and religious work was unjustly accused. After the defeat of the "Gang of Four," the urgent task in the field of ethnic and religious work was to heal the wounds caused by the ten years of turmoil, adjust ethnic and religious relations, reaffirm and restore the party's ethnic and religious policies, and formulate guiding principles for ethnic and religious work in the new era and implement pioneering work.
1. Restoration of the Party's Ethnic Policies
Reaffirming and adhering to the party's ethnic policies and implementing them requires work institutions and people to do this work. In 1978, the first session of the Fifth National People's Congress decided to restore the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and appointed Yang Jingren as its director. In 1979, the second session of the Fifth National People's Congress decided to restore the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, with Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Apei Awang Jinmei concurrently serving as Chairman. Other ethnic work institutions and ethnic affairs work institutions at all levels and in all regions have also been restored.
Shortly after the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, in April 1979, the central government presided over the National Border Defense Work Conference. This conference, with important historical significance, aimed to consolidate the country's border defense and promote national unity, and was instrumental in the "rectification" of ethnic work. One of the main topics of the conference was to discuss the tasks of ethnic work in the new period. Since the vast majority of China's border regions are inhabited by ethnic minorities, in order to establish and consolidate border defense, maintain national unity, and develop a favorable situation of stability and unity, it is necessary to do a good job in ethnic work and promote ethnic unity and common development and prosperity. In response to the damage caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" to ethnic policies and ethnic work, a series of policies on ethnic, religious, and united front work that had been proven correct in practice were reiterated at the conference. Emphasis was placed on the practice of ethnic work since the establishment of New China, and experiences and lessons were summarized: First, we must adhere to the principle of integrating theory with practice, starting from the actual conditions in the border areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated. In order to implement the party's line, policies, and tasks in the new era, they must be well integrated with the ethnic and regional characteristics of the border minority areas. Second, we must adhere to the view that ethnic issues exist in the long term. The socialist stage is a period of common development and prosperity for all ethnic groups. Throughout the socialist historical stage, ethnic work tasks are arduous and must be given due attention. The party's ethnic policies must be earnestly implemented, and the equal rights and the right to self-governance of ethnic minorities must be respected. Third, we must adhere to the proletarian perspective on ethnicity and, on the basis of consolidating the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, continuously strengthen the great unity of all ethnic groups. The consolidation of national unity and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the fundamental guarantees for accelerating the realization of the overall tasks in the new era. Fourth, we must adhere to the policy of combining state support with self-reliance, and accelerate the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority areas in the border regions. Practice has proven that the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority regions on the border relies on the revolutionary spirit of the local people, who must work hard and be self-reliant. At the same time, the state must adopt supportive policies and prioritize care, sincerely and actively assisting the economic and cultural development of ethnic minorities. This is a major task for the country in ethnic affairs. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has reviewed the conference report and called for the whole party to attach great importance to ethnic work, conduct the reeducation of ethnic policies, and thoroughly examine the implementation of ethnic policies in order to effectively address existing problems.
In September 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reviewed the document "Guidelines and Tasks for the United Front in the New Historical Period" from the National United Front Work Conference. The main content regarding strengthening ethnic work is as follows: according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, carry out widespread, in-depth, and vigorous reeducation on ethnic policies among the entire party and all the people of various ethnic groups nationwide. Carefully examine the implementation of ethnic policies and effectively address problems in ethnic relations, eliminating all factors detrimental to ethnic unity. Educate cadres and people of all ethnic groups, especially Han cadres and people, to fully understand the importance of enhancing ethnic unity and doing a good job in ethnic work, continuously improving their awareness of implementing ethnic policies. Treat ethnic minorities equally, respect their equal rights and autonomy, and respect their language, customs, and religious beliefs. It also pointed out the need to comprehensively implement the Party's policy of religious freedom.
Implementing the Party's ethnic policies not only requires doing well in ethnic work in areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated, but also attaching importance to ethnic work in areas where different ethnic groups live together or separately. In October 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council reviewed and approved the report from the Party Group of the Central Committee for Nationalities Affairs on doing a good job in the work of ethnic minorities living together or separately. It pointed out that while the struggle against Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" had achieved great victory, their remnants had not been completely eradicated. In many areas, ethnic and religious policies had not been earnestly implemented, and some unjust, false, and mistaken cases had not been rectified. In doing the work of ethnic minorities living together or separately, there were many problems that needed to be effectively addressed through appropriate measures. Ensuring the equal rights of ethnic minorities, actively assisting their economic and cultural development, respecting their customs, and implementing the policy of religious freedom were all emphasized. It also called for strengthening party leadership and restoring and improving various levels of ethnic work institutions. Party committees and governments at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and based on the opinions of the Party Group of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, organized inspections of the work of ethnic minorities living together or separately, formulated measures, implemented the Party's ethnic policies, and did a lot of work in this regard.
In response to the situation of weak awareness of ethnic policies caused by the turmoil of the past decade, in order to educate cadres of all ethnic groups and the general public on ethnic policies, the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission held a symposium on ethnic policy propaganda work in December 1979. They made arrangements for conducting reeducation on ethnic policies and decided to concentrate efforts for a period of time to extensively carry out propaganda and education on ethnic policies and ethnic unity. In January 1980, the minutes of the conference were approved by the three departments mentioned above, pointing out that conducting education on ethnic policies was crucial. The key focus of the reeducation was to overcome Han chauvinism, which was the key to adjusting ethnic relations and promoting ethnic unity at present. Attention should also be paid to preventing and overcoming major Han nationalism and local nationalism. The education should target cadres and the masses, with a particular emphasis on educating the Han people. Reeducation should be combined with examining the implementation of ethnic policies and solving practical problems. From the central to the local level, combining inspections of the implementation of ethnic, religious, and united front policies, extensive reeducation on ethnic policies was carried out, effectively addressing some prominent problems in ethnic relations, and improving the awareness of cadres and the masses in safeguarding ethnic policies and promoting ethnic unity. There was initial improvement in ethnic relations. For example, in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, efforts are being made to implement ethnic policies and promote ethnic unity. The "Regulations on Strengthening Ethnic Unity" have been issued and implemented, and the "Ethnic Unity Covenant" has been formulated. Ethnic unity and progress commendation conferences are widely held throughout the autonomous region, and activities promoting ethnic unity and progress are carried out. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee forwarded a document from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee, stating that faithfully implementing the party's ethnic policies and continuously strengthening ethnic unity is an extremely important task for all levels of Party Committees in all autonomous regions and areas with mixed ethnic populations. Concrete measures should be formulated, and efforts should be made to enhance ethnic policy education work, promoting the great development of ethnic unity.
The restoration and adherence to the party's ethnic policies is important, particularly in adhering to and implementing policies on ethnic regional autonomy. The first step is to restore the system of ethnic regional autonomy, followed by the cultivation of minority ethnic cadres. In 1979, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to restore the original administrative divisions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including some administrative regions that were temporarily assigned to Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia during the Cultural Revolution, which were brought under the jurisdiction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Efforts to resume the interrupted work on ethnic regional autonomy after the ten years of turbulence were restarted. At the same time, a number of new autonomous areas were established. From 1979 to the end of 1988, 53 new ethnic autonomous areas were successively established nationwide. The key to implementing and implementing the policy of ethnic regional autonomy is to empower the ethnic minorities who exercise autonomy to truly be in charge of their own affairs within their ethnic and local regions, as well as to cultivate a minority ethnic cadres. The "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" promulgated in 1982 restored and developed some important principles on ethnic regional autonomy in the 1954 Constitution. Based on the changes in the national situation during the new era of socialist construction, a series of important amendments and supplements were made to expand the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous organs, clearly stipulating the autonomy rights of ethnic autonomous regions in terms of minority ethnic cadres and in the independent arrangement and management of economic and cultural construction in their local areas. The constitution also indicates that the state and higher-level people's governments will help ethnic minorities in their development of economic and cultural undertakings, fully reflecting the spirit of respecting and guaranteeing the democratic rights of minority ethnic groups to manage their internal affairs. In the new era of reform and opening up, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy not only recovered from the destruction of the ten years of turmoil but also achieved new developments. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, a large number of minority ethnic cadres returned to their positions through the rectification of previous wrongdoings and the redress of miscarrying justice cases. Efforts to cultivate minority ethnic cadres were strengthened from the central government to local governments, adopting many practical and effective measures. Minority ethnic cadres grew rapidly, reaching 1.84 million people by 1988.
2. New Guidelines for Tibet Work
In China's ethnic relations, Tibet is particularly sensitive. Tibet began to address its historical issues as early as 1977, including reviewing and redressing the cases of full-time cadres who were investigated and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, rearranging patriotic elites as national or regional People's Congress representatives, members of the Political Consultative Conference, or government officials, and granting amnesty to all incarcerated personnel involved in the 1959 Tibetan rebellion. In November 1978, one week after the Central Working Conference, Deng Xiaoping conveyed the intention to reconcile with the Dalai Lama to the West. Three months later, Deng Xiaoping met with representatives sent by the Dalai Lama in Beijing and said, "Welcome the Dalai Lama's return, welcome more people to come and see."
Hu Yaobang, who became the General Secretary of the Central Committee in February 1980, was first concerned with the Tibet issue. On March 14th to 15th, 1980, he presided over a conference on Tibet work, listening to reports from the responsible party committee leaders of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Hu Yaobang emphasized at the meeting that to accelerate Tibet's development, it was necessary to further liberate thinking, implement policies, resolutely eliminate the remnants of the "left" leaning, correct the "left" economic policies, courageously cultivate and promote Tibetan cadres, and gradually make Tibetan cadres the main body of county-level and above Party and government organs. In terms of religion, we must handle the Lamaism issue carefully, deal with the historical legacy issues such as suppressing rebellions, expanding them, and wrongly classifying wealthy peasants, strengthen our work on the Dalai Group and the relatives of Tibetans who have fled abroad and remained in the country, mobilize all positive factors, and consolidate the stable and united situation. On April 7th, the Communist Party Central Committee approved the summary of this meeting and issued a notice. In late May, Hu Yaobang, Wan Li, and more than ten officials from relevant departments of the central government visited Tibet for investigation. On May 29th, Hu Yaobang delivered a speech at a meeting of cadres above the county level in the Tibet Autonomous Region, proposing that Tibet should prioritize six major tasks, including resolutely implementing the policy of recuperation and revitalization and adopting more flexible economic policies compared to those on the mainland, as well as restoring and developing Tibetan culture and scientific endeavors. The most important part includes two points: firstly, granting Tibet "sufficient and independent autonomy", and regarding central policies, those that do not conform to the situation in Tibet may be not be implemented or implemented with flexibility; those that are not conducive to ethnic unity and the development of productive forces may be disregarded. Secondly, emphasizing the strengthening of unity between Han and Tibetan cadres, and the method is to gradually withdraw Han cadres and replace them with Tibetan cadres, so that within two to three years, Tibetan cadres account for more than two-thirds of the national cadre stationed in Tibet. Regarding the cadres working in Tibet, Hu Yaobang had both encouragement and criticism, stating that "Han cadres working in Tibet have completed their historical tasks" and proposed the withdrawal of 80% of Han people from Tibet. Based on Hu Yaobang's opinion, the Tibet Autonomous Region submitted a report to the central government titled "Request for a Large-scale Withdrawal of Cadres and Workers from Tibet", proposing that, except for a small number of leading cadres and technical backbone personnel, most of those sent to Tibet should be gradually recalled or retired. On August 6th, the report was approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council. From 1980 to the end of 1981, more than 20,000 cadres were withdrawn from Tibet in two separate groups, mostly those who had been sent to Tibet in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1986, the decision was made to transfer an additional 17,000 cadres and workers (including retirees) to Tibet from the mainland.
The central government's policies on Tibet have had a significant impact on Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, and other ethnic regions. On May 31, 1980, when Hu Yaobang made a brief stop in Golmud, he told officials from Qinghai Province, "The six points we discussed at the cadre conference in the Tibet Autonomous Region basically apply to the situation in Qinghai as well, and you can refer to them for study and implementation." Both Hu Yaobang and Wan Li emphasized that the policies should be further relaxed and that the right to exercise autonomy in ethnic autonomous regions should be fully exercised. The intention was to extend the policy guidelines for resolving Tibet's issues to other ethnic regions. Subsequently, party committees in provinces and autonomous regions such as Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Guangxi held meetings to study the instructions of the Communist Party Central Committee regarding work in Tibet and Hu Yaobang's speech on Tibet, and decided to solve local issues in accordance with the instructions of the central government regarding work in Tibet. Afterwards, the General Office of the Communist Party Central Committee successively discussed work in Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, forming the summary of ethnic work in Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.
In the early 1980s, the party began to adjust its ethnic policies with a focus on improving ethnic relations. However, the official publication "Contemporary Tibet in China" pointed out that the large-scale withdrawal of Han people and Han cadres from Tibet was done "relatively crudely," leading to the transfer of a group of urgently needed talents from Tibet and greatly impacting various aspects of Tibetan work, especially in science and technology, education, healthcare, and finance. Deng Liqun also critically criticized the decision to withdraw a large number of cadres sent to Tibet from a political perspective. Some domestic scholars also expressed dissent regarding the decision to withdraw cadres sent to Tibet, based on considerations of national security.
3. Restoration and adjustment of religious policies
Since 1957, the party has gradually developed "leftist" errors in religious work, which further escalated in the mid-1960s. In particular, during the "Cultural Revolution", Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" group deliberately exploited this "left" mistake, blatantly trampling on the scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought regarding religious issues, completely negating the correct policy of the Party towards religion since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and fundamentally canceling the Party's work on religion. They forcibly banned the normal religious life of the religious masses, treating patriotic individuals in the religious community and even ordinary religious believers as "objects of dictatorship", and created a large number of unjust cases in the religious community. They also regarded the customs and traditions of certain ethnic minorities as religious superstition and forcibly banned them, even suppressing religious believers in some areas, undermining national unity. They used violence in religious matters, but as a result, religious activities developed in a secret and fragmented manner. A few bad elements took advantage of these conditions to engage in illegal criminal activities and disruptive activities under the guise of religious activities.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the correct policy and direction of the Party towards religion gradually resumed. At this time, the core of the adjustment in religious policies was to a certain extent the opening up of religious freedom. On December 1, 1978, the Central United Front Work Department held a national religious work symposium, putting forward the main tasks of religious work in the future period: earnestly implementing the policy of religious freedom, properly arranging religious activity venues, and uniting the vast religious believers to participate in socialist construction. It proposed to restore and improve religious work institutions and the activities of patriotic religious organizations. The summary of this meeting was forwarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
In 1979, nationwide religious organizations and local religious groups successively resumed their activities. Religious clergy gradually returned to temples and churches and resumed their religious duties. Some long-prohibited ethnic religious festivals were gradually restored.
On January 25, 1980, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approved the report from the Central United Front Work Department on holding national conferences for various religious organizations. That year, the Chinese Islamic Association, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches in China, and the Chinese Buddhist Association successively held conferences, elected leaders of various religious organizations, formulated activity regulations, and resumed their work. In various regions, 164 provincial-level religious organizations and over 2,000 county-level religious organizations were gradually restored or established. On July 16, the State Council forwarded reports from the Religious Affairs Bureau and the National Construction Commission, returning the property rights of religious organization housing to the religious organizations and offering discounted payments for those unable to be returned; returning occupied temples and churches, returning deposits of religious organizations. In some large and medium-sized cities, famous religious sites, places where believers gather, especially in ethnic minority areas, a number of temples, monasteries, and churches were restored in a planned and systematic manner. On April 1, 1983, the State Council also approved the opening of 163 key Buddhist and Taoist temples in Han areas. The government provided financial subsidies for the maintenance of some temples, monasteries, and shrines. According to incomplete statistics, from 1980 to 1991, more than 140 million yuan in repair subsidies were allocated from the central finances to temples, monasteries, and churches. As of 1992, over 60,000 religious activity venues had been restored nationwide. Starting from 1980, national religious colleges and 41 local religious colleges such as the Chinese Buddhist Academy, Chinese Islamic College, Nanjing Union Theological Seminary of the Protestant Churches in China, Chinese Catholic Philosophy and Theology Institute, Chinese Taoist Academy, and Chinese Tibetan Buddhism Advanced Buddhist Academy were successively restored or newly established. In March 1982, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the "Basic Viewpoints and Basic Policies on Religious Issues in China during the Socialist Period", emphasizing the long-term nature of religious issues under socialist conditions and criticizing the idea and practice of trying to eliminate religion at once by relying on administrative orders or other coercive means. It reaffirmed the policy of respecting and protecting religious freedom but did not allow religious intervention in state political affairs.
From August 29th to September 7th, 1979, the Chinese religious delegation, led by Zhao Puchu, the deputy head of the China Buddhist Association, and Ding Guangxun, the vice chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China, participated in the Third World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP) held in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. In October, the Chinese Muslim pilgrimage group was allowed to make a pilgrimage to Mecca for the first time after the Cultural Revolution, indicating that the Communist Party of China was willing to restore international exchanges with the domestic religious community under certain conditions. However, a high degree of vigilance was maintained towards the infiltration of foreign churches into domestic religions. On March 4th, 1980, the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council forwarded a report from the Bureau of Religious Affairs and other departments titled "Regarding the Request to Resist the Religious Infiltration by Foreign Churches" which pointed out the harmfulness of foreign religious infiltration and emphasized the need for internal and external efforts to prevent and restrict its influence as much as possible.
A comprehensive review of the basic situation of religious work during this period clearly reveals that the fundamental tasks of the Party and the government in religious work are to firmly implement the policy of religious freedom, consolidate and expand the patriotic political alliance of the religious circles of all ethnic groups, strengthen their education on patriotism and socialism, and mobilize their positive factors to jointly strive for the construction of a modern socialist country, the fulfillment of the great cause of national reunification, and the opposition against hegemonism and the maintenance of world peace. Guided by these basic tasks, the entire Party comrades, party committees at all levels, especially the departments responsible for religious work at all levels, earnestly summarized and absorbed the historical experiences, both positive and negative, of the Party's religious work since the founding of the New China. They further understood and grasped the objective laws of the occurrence, development, and disappearance of religions, overcame all difficulties and obstacles, and firmly placed the Party's religious policy onto the scientific track of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
4. Implement the policy of the united front and develop a patriotic united front
After the fall of the "Gang of Four," the organizations and activities of various democratic parties gradually resumed. After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the comprehensive launch of rectification and the start of reform and opening up, the Party's united front work fully resumed. The democratic parties began to play their role in the country's political life in terms of participating in policy-making and democratic supervision. The theory of the Party's united front also became enriched and developed.
In June 1979, during his opening speech at the Second Session of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Deng Xiaoping analyzed the situation of various classes in Chinese society and clearly pointed out the new tasks and changes facing the united front in the new era. He used the concepts of "socialist workers and patriotic supporters of socialism." He stated, "The united front in our country has become a broad alliance led by the working class, based on the alliance between workers and peasants, comprised of socialist workers and patriotic supporters of socialism. In the new era, the task of the united front and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is to mobilize all positive factors, strive to turn negative factors into positive factors, unite all possible forces, and work together to maintain and develop a stable and united political situation, and strive for the construction of a modern socialist country." Shortly after, the Party Central Committee further proposed that "the united front which can be revolutionary and patriotic is now the largest united front, which is the issue of Taiwan's return and the reunification of the motherland." In accordance with this directive, the 14th National United Front Work Conference held in August 1979 used the term "revolutionary patriotic united front." The conference believed that in the new era, although there are still various contradictions between socialist workers, farmers, intellectuals, and other patriotic supporters of socialism within the united front, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. The basic policies and methods of the revolutionary patriotic united front must be based on the actual transformation of the main internal contradictions. It is necessary to strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions, take the correct handling of internal contradictions among the people as the overall theme, strictly adhere to socialist democracy and socialist legal system, and correctly handle various contradictions within the united front. Actively help non-Party members in all aspects to make new progress and contributions in achieving the Four Modernizations. For all those who love the motherland, "as long as they support the reunification of the motherland, even if they do not support the socialist system, they should unite."
In October of the same year, the CPC Central Committee forwarded the guidelines and tasks of the National United Front Work Conference for the New Historical Period. This document provides a realistic and objective analysis of the fundamental changes in the social class conditions in the 30 years since the establishment of New China, and clarifies the nature, guidelines, and tasks of the united front in the new period. The document points out that the foundation of our united front, the alliance between the workers and peasants, has entered a new stage with the central task of realizing socialist modernization. The vast majority of intellectuals, including most intellectuals who came from the old society, have become part of the working class and an important backbone force in realizing modernization. The various ethnic groups in the country have formed a new type of socialist unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation. In the process of realizing modernization, the socialist consensus among the various ethnic groups will further develop, and patriotic individuals of different religious beliefs will also make great progress. The capitalist class as a class no longer exists in our country. They have undergone various tests in accepting the path of socialist transformation and the struggle against Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, and the majority of them support the Party's leadership and the socialist system. Now, as self-reliant workers or state officials, they are contributing to the Four Modernizations. The democratic parties in our country have become political alliances serving socialism, and they are part of the socialist workers and those who support socialism. Part of the individuals who were originally on the enemy side, such as amnestied war criminals and released KMT officials at the county and regimental levels, have been transformed to the side of the people after a long period of reform. Class struggle is no longer the main contradiction in our society. With the strategic shift of the party's work focus and the fundamental changes in the domestic class conditions, the united front in the new period should be called the revolutionary patriotic united front, which is a broad alliance of all socialist workers and patriots. In the new historical period, the guidelines and tasks of the united front are to unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors at home and abroad, make efforts to transform negative factors into positive ones, and make unremitting efforts to maintain and develop a stable and unified political situation. Together, we strive to build our country into a modern socialist power, and strive for the reunification of Taiwan with the motherland and the realization of national unity. This document not only deals with the influence of "Left" mistakes in the work of the united front, but also plays a role in implementing the party's various policies.
Soon afterwards, the CPC Central Committee put forward the concept of "patriotic united front." This is because although the concept of the revolutionary patriotic united front has developed significantly compared to the past, it still cannot cover a wider range of united front targets and does not fully adapt to the tasks and requirements of the new historical conditions. In June 1981, the Resolution on Some Historical Issues of the Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, passed at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, clearly pointed out, "We must unswervingly unite all forces that can be united and consolidate and expand the patriotic united front."
The 15th National United Front Work Conference, held from December 1981 to January 1982, further elaborated on the "patriotic united front" and emphasized that the united front in the new period is still a major weapon of the Party. The conference believed that for a long time, due to the influence of "Left" thinking, there has been a tendency to neglect or even abandon the united front. Recognizing the importance and long-term nature of the united front is a prerequisite for doing a good job in united front work. Hu Yaobang pointed out in his speech: "In the new historical period, in the long, long historical period to come, the united front will still be necessary, important, and still have great vitality. It will still be a great treasure of our party." The meeting further clarified the scope and target of the patriotic united front in the new era, proposing that there are two united fronts in the new era, one is the united front against aggression and expansion on an international scale, and the other is the patriotic united front within the country. The patriotic united front within the country is the widest united front of all socialist workers, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who support national reunification. In the long term to come, the target of united front work will not decrease, but increase; the scope of united front work will not narrow, but expand. The united front work within the country can include ten aspects: the democratic parties, non-party prominent figures, mainly patriots; non-party intellectual cadres; former Kuomintang military and political personnel who have defected or surrendered; former wealthy business owners; upper-class figures of ethnic minorities; patriotic religious leaders; family members and friends of those who left Taiwan and settled in mainland China; compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao; and returnees and overseas Chinese. 
The introduction of the concept of "patriotic united front" is the development of the party's theory of united front. This understanding accurately expresses the characteristics of the united front in the new era. It has developed from the "revolutionary patriotic united front" to the "patriotic united front," encompassing more united front targets without changing its nature, which is more conducive to strengthening unity. This change not only develops the party's theory of united front but also makes the united front policy more in line with China's social reality in the new era. The patriotism spoken of by the patriotic united front is essentially socialist patriotism, but its range is broader than socialism, including patriots who support national reunification but may not necessarily endorse socialism or have doubts about socialism. The proposal of the patriotic united front is a combination of principles and flexibility. Regarding the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties, as well as other non-party patriotic democratic people in the united front, Mao Zedong proposed the eight-character principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" as early as April 1956. This eight-character principle objectively reflects the history and reality of the Chinese revolution, embodying the Communist Party of China's proposal for long-term coexistence with the democratic parties and the equal status of the democratic parties. However, from the late 1950s to the end of the "Cultural Revolution", this correct principle for handling the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties was not well implemented. Especially during the "Cultural Revolution", the work and activities of the democratic parties were forced to stop. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of China reaffirmed the guideline of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the democratic parties. Deng Xiaoping also clearly stated, "This is a long-term unchanging principle."
In the new era of reform and opening up, with profound changes in China's social class relations, the class color of the democratic parties has gradually faded, and they have essentially become political parties of some socialist workers. To adapt to this change, the Communist Party of China further developed the "eight-character principle" that guides its relationship with the democratic parties into the "sixteen-character principle". Hu Yaobang pointed out at the 15th National United Front Work Conference in January 1982: Our comrades should "be friends with all non-party members, and develop from casual acquaintances to true friends, and then to a relationship of mutual trust, shared honor and disgrace"; "We should clearly state to all party comrades and also tell our non-party friends that in the new historical period, we must truly establish a relationship of mutual trust, shared honor and disgrace with our non-party friends." This is the first time that the Communist Party of China has proposed the eight characters of "mutual trust, shared honor and disgrace" in its united front work. In September of the same year, Hu Yaobang, in his report to the 12th Party Congress, for the first time, linked the eight characters "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" with the eight characters "liver and gallbladder in harmony, sharing honor and disgrace", proposing that our party should continue to adhere to the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, liver and gallbladder in harmony, sharing honor and disgrace, and strengthen cooperation with democratic parties, non-party democrats, ethnic minorities, and patriotic individuals in the religious circles". In November of the same year, Deng Xiaoping also emphasized the sixteen-character policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, liver and gallbladder in harmony, sharing honor and disgrace" in his speech at the opening ceremony of the Fifth Session of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, thus formally establishing the sixteen characters as the fundamental guiding policy for the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties in the new era. The proposal of the sixteen-character policy is in line with the objective reality of reform and opening up and socialist modernization in the new era, and is conducive to the role of democratic parties and democrats, inspiring them to participate in the joint management of state affairs, strengthen long-term cooperation, and make the unity between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties closer.
After the 12th National Congress of the Party, with the comprehensive launch of reform and opening up and the implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems", the united front further assumed the dual tasks of serving socialist modernization and completing the great cause of national reunification, with a wider range of targets and richer contents. In this situation, the 16th National United Front Work Conference held in late November to December 1986 put forward the idea of "two alliances", namely one is the alliance composed of all mainland workers and patriots with socialism as the political basis, and the other is the alliance consisting of compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese with patriotism and support for national reunification as the political basis. These two alliances constitute not only the whole of the united front in the new era, but also an important new characteristic of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Chapter 3: Strengthening the Party's Leadership in the Field of Ideology and Culture and Scientifically Evaluating Mao Zedong's Historical Position
I. Denouncing the class struggle as the guiding principle and reaffirming the Four Cardinal Principles
After the Great Debate on the Criteria of Truth, especially after the Central Work Conference and the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the mistakes of the "two whatevers" were seriously criticized, and the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts was re-established. However, the differences of opinions and debates within the party over the ideological line have not been completely eliminated. Not only that, at the same time, two types of erroneous tendencies have emerged within the party and society. One type is those who are still influenced by the "left" mistakes, who remain in a rigid and semi-rigid state, skeptical of the line and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and even have a resistance. The other type is the appearance of a tendency to negate socialism and the leadership of the party among a certain number of people. In order to ensure the implementation of the shift of the party's work focus, and to smoothly advance the cause of modernization under the new situation, the central authorities explicitly put forward the requirement to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles.
1. The introduction of the political foundation of modernization construction in the new era
In the climax of ideological liberation, China entered 1979. On the first day of the new year, Deng Xiaoping, at the symposium held by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, highly praised the new political situation and social atmosphere, and for the first time raised the issue of the political foundation of modernization construction.
Deng Xiaoping said that Chairman Mao's dynamic and vivid political situation, which has both centralization and democracy, discipline and freedom, unified will and personal joy and liveliness, which he proposed in 1957, gradually formed last year. This atmosphere and situation can be summarized as a lively and vivid political atmosphere. We must develop and uphold this atmosphere and situation throughout the country, in the party, the government, the military, and the people. This is the political foundation for achieving the four modernizations. Without such a political situation, the four modernizations cannot be achieved. For quite a long time in the past, we did not handle well the relationship between democracy and centralization, and lacked some democracy, therefore, we should promote democracy even more.
Deng Xiaoping's speech represents the spirit of the central authorities and is the consensus of the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee. On January 2nd, when Hu Yaobang reported on the national political ideology to Hua Guofeng, Hua Guofeng also emphasized the firm commitment to improving the democratic life of our party and country. This is a political policy determined by the Third Plenary Session, and it is resolute. It is necessary to guide party members and cadres well. Party committees at all levels and newspapers should guide the healthy and orderly development of our democratic life, and avoid going astray. 
After experiencing a major change, especially for China, which has just gone through the "Cultural Revolution" and is emerging from the shadow of the "Two Whatevers," re-examining and establishing the political foundation of China's modernization construction is of great significance to the entire historical turning point. Therefore, as soon as the issue of the political foundation is raised, it immediately arouses extensive social repercussions. The main media such as People's Daily and Liberation Army Daily consecutively published editorials, signed articles, and investigative reports, further elaborating on the political foundation of modernization construction. In less than a month, People's Daily published articles such as "People's Representatives Must Be Elected by the People," "Democracy and the Rule of Law are the Political Ensures of Achieving the Four Modernizations," "Promote Democracy and Achieve the Four Modernizations," "There Must Be a Sound Democratic Life Within the Party," and "Proletarian Democracy and Proletarian Dictatorship," emphasizing that "the realization of socialist modernization cannot be separated from the extensive development of socialist democracy. The four modernizations must be accompanied by political democratization," and calling for "the kind of democratic style as required by the Third Plenary Session to be expanded to the whole party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups in the country."
It is in such a social atmosphere that the preparation work for the theoretical conference on abstract work began.
The proposal for the theoretical conference on abstract work was initially proposed by Ye Jianying. As for the specific time when this proposal was made, there is no record in the authoritative biography of Ye Jianying's activities, "Biography of Ye Jianying". However, Hu Yaobang's speech at the theoretical conference on abstract work and "Chronology of Deng Xiaoping" provide important evidence.
Hu Yaobang pointed out in the "Introduction to the Theoretical Conference on Abstract Work" that in May of last year, an important development on the ideological and theoretical front was the beginning of discussions on the practice as the sole criterion for testing truth, which caused a stir on our country's ideological and theoretical front. In September of last year, an article titled "Reviewing 'On Practice' - The Practice Standard is the Foundation of Marxist Epistemology" was written by the editorial office of Red Flag magazine and sent to the Central Committee. Comrade Ye Jianying proposed that the central government convene a theoretical conference on abstract work, so that everyone could put their differing opinions on the table, and through full democratic discussion, achieve unified understanding and resolve this issue.
On October 14, 1978, during a conversation with Wei Guoqing, Deng Xiaoping also mentioned, "Comrade Ye Jianying proposed the convening of a theoretical conference on abstract work. It's better to openly discuss it instead of talking behind the scenes."
Subsequently, in his speech at the closing ceremony of the Central Work Conference, Hua Guofeng officially proposed, "During this meeting, comrades have brought up many situations and raised many questions regarding the issue of 'practice as the sole criterion for testing truth.' Many comrades have received criticism. This has created favorable conditions for convening a theoretical conference on abstract work. Due to the multiple agenda items and limited time of this Central Work Conference, it is not possible to spend much time resolving this issue. The opinions of the members of the Politburo of the Central Committee still align with Comrade Ye Jianying's proposal to convene a theoretical conference on abstract work specifically after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, in order to further resolve this issue well."
The preparation work for the theoretical conference on abstract work was presided over by Hu Yaobang.
On January 7, 1979, Hu Yaobang sent a letter to the members of the Politburo of the Central Committee, submitting for review the drafted "Introduction" and conference notice that will serve as the opening remarks of the theoretical conference on abstract work. The letter stated, "I have preliminary considered the format for the theoretical conference on abstract work: first, invite around two hundred theoretical workers in the capital, hold the conference in late January or early February, for approximately twenty days. Then take a few days to rest and report to the Central Committee." Please invite around 200 theoretical workers from various places, totaling about 400 people, and have the conference last for around 10 days. The first session of the conference will mainly involve discussions, group discussions, and speeches, allowing everyone to freely express their thoughts. In the second session, we would like Comrade Guofeng, Comrade Jianying, and Comrade Xiaoping to give speeches, guiding everyone in discussing and resolving important issues that need to be addressed urgently in the ideological and theoretical front. We will first have democracy, then centralization, in order to unify our thinking and improve the theoretical work after the shift of the Party's work focus.
After Hu Yaobang's "Introduction to the Virtual Conference on Theoretical Work" draft and letter were sent out, they quickly received the approval response from the members of the Central Politburo Standing Committee. Hu Guofeng expressed his agreement first.
On January 9th, Hu Yaobang chaired a meeting of the Ministry of Propaganda to officially determine the specific agenda for the virtual conference on theoretical work: (1) Conference start date: January 18th. (2) Conference venue: Friendship Hotel, Jingu West Hotel. (3) The conference will be divided into two sessions: The first session will last for 20 days (around 10 days before and after the Spring Festival), with 200 delegates participating, mainly consisting of those in Beijing, with one representative from each province, municipality, and autonomous region, focusing on group meetings. The second session will last for 10 days, with 400 delegates (200 from Beijing and 200 from local areas) participating, mainly held in the name of the CPC Central Committee, inviting the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee to give speeches, with the conference as the main focus. There will be a one-week break between the two sessions. (4) Members of the leadership group for the virtual conference on theoretical work: Hu Yaobang, Hu Qiaomu, Huang Zhen, Zhu Muzhi, Hu Jiwei, Yu Guangyuan, Zhou Yang, Tong Dalin, Wu Lengxi, Wu Jiang, Hu Sheng. (5) Members of the drafting group for conference documents: Hu Yaobang, Hu Qiaomu, Yu Guangyuan, Wu Jiang, Ruan Ming, Lin Jianqing, Li Honglin.
Although later on, the conference not only exceeded the original plan in terms of time but also made adjustments to procedures and content, with the careful preparation of Hu Yaobang, the virtual conference on theoretical work officially began on January 18th.
2. The convening of the virtual conference on theoretical work
Hu Yaobang presided over the opening ceremony of the conference. At the beginning of the conference, he first announced the list of members of the conference leadership group and the list of conveners of the five groups.
The conveners of each group will serve as the leaders and deputy leaders of the respective groups. In addition, 20 specially invited attendees, all of whom are veteran comrades, were notified that they could freely participate and receive documents and briefings to accommodate their physical condition and work.
During the opening session, Hu Yaobang delivered a speech, the main content of which was the same as the "Introduction to the Virtual Conference on Theoretical Work."
In his speech, Hu Yaobang highly praised the achievements made in the ideological and theoretical field since 1977, believing that in terms of scale, the role it played in the struggle, and its contribution to the improvement of the Party's theoretical level, the past two years' work has surpassed any period since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. He praised the theoretical workers as the vanguard soldiers of the ideological and theoretical front. The emergence of a group of outstanding pioneers has strengthened the power of our Marxist theoretical team and is a remarkable achievement. He said that it is rare in history for theoretical work to become a truly mass activity like it is today. If we look at the world, there are not many nations like the Chinese people who care about theoretical issues and have such an interest in theory. This is a valuable national spirit.
In order to adapt the theoretical propaganda work to the shifting focus of the Party and the country, Hu Yaobang proposed a general guiding principle in his speech. He said that after the shift in the party's work focus, the fundamental task of theoretical propaganda work can be summarized in a few sentences: combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the great practice of realizing the Four Modernizations, studying new problems, solving new problems, making our ideological and theoretical work as advanced as possible in practical work, continuously enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and guiding us to achieve victory in a new long march.
The conference was divided into groups starting from the second day. On January 22nd, Hu Yaobang conveyed several points of views from Deng Xiaoping regarding the theoretical work forum. Deng Xiaoping emphasized the need for open-minded discussions. There can be more discussions on the standards of truth, and they should be done quickly. Many theoretical problems have not been clarified yet, such as democracy, rule of law, and economic management issues. The "Cultural Revolution" can also be discussed. The issue of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" can also be explored. In the future, there should be no mention of "holding high the banner of Chairman Mao," instead, the banner of Mao Zedong Thought should be raised. Based on Deng Xiaoping's instructions and the preliminary discussions of each conference group, Hu Yaobang once again gave a speech, summarizing several major issues for in-depth study by the conference. These issues include: how to deepen the discussion on the standards of truth; how the class struggle during the socialist period came about as the party's basic theory; the experience and lessons of theoretical work since the founding of the New China; the evaluation of the "Cultural Revolution," its nature, requirements, and lessons; the issue of socialist democracy; highlighting the propaganda of individual problems, and so on.
Subsequently, the conference discussions became more lively. The speeches from each group were sent to the conference secretariat, which distributed detailed briefings to each participant. Therefore, the exchange of information was timely. A total of 262 briefings were issued during this phase. Although Hu Yaobang explicitly requested that the conference materials and discussion content should not be spread outside, the distribution of briefings was relatively extensive, reaching many readers, and thus the influence of the conference quickly spread in society.
Almost simultaneously with the convening of the Central Conference on Theoretical Work, provinces and cities such as Shandong, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, Liaoning, Hunan, and Jiangsu also held similar conferences before the Spring Festival. The number of participants generally ranged from fifty to sixty, reaching three hundred in Shanghai.
The first phase of the Conference on Theoretical Work ended in mid-February 1979, and the second phase began in late March. In addition to the personnel from the original central units, comrades from various provinces and cities (mainly Party committee secretaries and propaganda ministers responsible for ideological propaganda work) were invited according to the plan, with a total of four to five hundred people. The Conference on Theoretical Work continued until April 3rd.
From the progress of the first phase of the conference, the Conference on Theoretical Work upheld the democratic atmosphere restored at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhered to the principles and directions of emancipating the mind, not only continued to sharply criticize the mistaken guiding ideology of the "Two Whatevers," but also challenged so-called "taboo areas". Many important theoretical issues were deeply discussed, such as the formulation of certain terms related to class struggle during the socialist period, the theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, whether the internal struggle of the party reflects class struggles, at what stage China's socialism is in, the opposition to superstitious beliefs, socialist democracy, economic theory and practical issues, etc. Multiple aspects were reasoned and provided decision-making references for the central leadership, many of which were valuable. Many issues raised at the conference were gradually resolved through research and practice, playing a role in promoting the formation and development of the theory and cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
However, at this conference, due to the lack of a comprehensive analysis of the situation after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party and the lack of systematic analysis and research on the rapidly changing ideological situation, there was insufficient preparation and some representatives' speeches showed obvious erroneous tendencies and ambiguous understanding. And this situation is intertwined with the complex social environment, which poses new challenges to the new situation of socialist construction being developed.
3. The presentation of social instability factors under the new situation
Before the theoretical work virtual meeting was held, some places had sparked some social contradictions due to many problems left over from the "Cultural Revolution". Some people took the opportunity to cause trouble and put forward various demands that were impossible to achieve or fundamentally unreasonable under the current conditions. They incited the masses to attack party and government organs, occupy offices, engage in sit-ins and hunger strikes, and block transportation. Particularly serious was the emergence of ideological trends that doubted or even denied the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist system, proletarian dictatorship, and Mao Zedong Thought. The "Xidan Democracy Wall," which began to form in late October 1978, became the main battleground for these propaganda and activities at that time.
On January 6, 1979, Ren Haiting and seven others posted a printed flyer titled "Declaration of Chinese Human Rights," announcing the establishment of the so-called "Chinese Human Rights Alliance" and putting forward 12 principles. They handed it to foreign journalists, claiming that "this alliance requests support from human rights organizations and the public from all countries in the world" and requested that the US President "pay attention" to human rights in China.
A female worker in Beijing organized a "Citizen Petitioning Group" with some petitioners' support. They marched and demonstrated on Tiananmen Square under banners saying "Against Hunger, Against Persecution, We Demand Human Rights and Democracy," and petitioned at the gate of Xinhua Gate. Thousands of onlookers caused severe traffic congestion. On January 18, the Beijing authorities detained this female worker. The "Chinese Human Rights Alliance" and seven other organizations along with the printed publication called the "Joint Declaration" planned to hold a mass accusation meeting at the Xidan Democracy Wall and later petitioned in Zhongnanhai.
At the same time as the Xidan Democracy Wall became active, some grassroots organizations and publications also emerged. Wei Jingsheng and his publication "Explore" began to attract attention at this time.
Wei Jingsheng was a worker at the Beijing Park Services Management Office and the editor-in-chief of the printed publication "Explore." From December 1978 to March 1979, he continuously wrote articles and distributed publications, accusing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought of being "a more sophisticated ointment than quack medicines." He slandered the national system of proletarian dictatorship as "a feudal monarchy wearing a socialist coat" and incited the masses to "no longer trust the 'stability and unity' of the dictator," and to "focus their anger on the evil system that creates the miserable fate of the people," and incited them to "seize power from these lords." Some of his articles were posted on the Xidan Wall, and some were published in "Explore." This publication was widely posted, distributed, and sold in Beijing and Tianjin.
In addition, there were eight workers in Guiyang who initiated the establishment of the "Enlightenment Society," with the headquarters in Guiyang and a branch in Beijing, with a membership of over 30 people. They advocated the "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" of the capitalist world. In March 1979, the main leaders of the "Enlightenment Society" established the "Thaw Society" in Beijing, announcing their intention to "cancel class struggle, violent revolution, and all forms of dictatorship."
Similar organizations and publications also appeared in Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places.
There are different understandings and judgments within the party and the theoretical community regarding how to understand and judge these new situations in the ideological and theoretical circles. Some people sympathize with or even support these new social trends and issues.
During the theoretical work virtual meeting, some suggested that "the central government should express its support for the Democracy Wall." Some said, "Even under socialist conditions, democracy is achieved by the people's own struggle, by breaking the resistance of bureaucrats and opportunists, and by breaking the suppression of excessive concentration of power and bureaucratic centralism in order to achieve it. "Democracy cannot rely on anyone's favor." "The main problem now is that democracy is not sufficiently promoted, not too much. We should not correct it." Some people also say, "What we need to be cautious about now is not excessive liberation of thought or democracy, and definitely not a new anti-rightist movement. We have not criticized the 'left' enough yet. If we propose an anti-rightist movement, it will hinder the criticism of the 'left' and affect ideological liberation, even possibly going backwards. The so-called 'right' should not be treated as a dangerous tendency, and as for individual exceptional cases, we can guide them through practical work. We should maintain clarity in our thinking about such problems, but there is no need to openly oppose it as a tendency in theoretical propaganda." Some individuals suggested a column titled "Democracy Wall" be established in newspapers to publish big-character posters. Others mentioned that Mao Zedong's ideology should also be evaluated with a critical eye and that it contains certain errors. Some people believe that "without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China" and "it wouldn't be excessive to evaluate Chairman Mao's achievements," but these statements go too far. These discussions and debates clearly indicate that there have been deviations in the theoretical work in dealing with new situations and problems.
4. A preliminary response to new erroneous tendencies
The various new situations that have emerged domestically and internationally, particularly the discussions and debates in the party's theoretical work, have raised Deng Xiaoping's high vigilance. He keenly sensed the seriousness of the problem and thus, starting from March 1979, he delivered multiple speeches, stating clearly the necessity of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles.
On March 16, 1979, at the meeting held by the CPC Central Committee on the situation of the counterattack in self-defense against Vietnam, Deng Xiaoping explicitly pointed out the need to uphold Chairman Mao's great banner. He said that negating Chairman Mao is negating the People's Republic of China, negating the entire history of the Party. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China. This is history. It means that without Mao Zedong's ideology guiding us to achieve revolutionary victory, we might still be struggling in the dark. When writing articles, we must be careful to uphold Chairman Mao's great banner and not harm it in any way. Both domestic and foreign class enemies hope that we will be confused on these major issues. We must tell party members and the people not to be misled. The key now is stability and unity. We address outstanding problems in order to concentrate our efforts on moving forward. He sternly pointed out the excessive actions taken by some educated youth demanding resettlement, saying that we should ask them, what will be the result if they cause unrest and attack government agencies? Haven't we learned from past lessons? If everything collapses, what hope is there for achieving the Four Modernizations? What hope is there for stability and unity? If all leadership agencies focus their energy on dealing with these matters, then there will be no energy left for achieving the Four Modernizations, improving people's lives, or developing the national economy. We must consider issues both in their local and overall context, both in the short term and long term. These problems should be used to educate the entire nation. He said that some people in China admire foreign human rights movements, why don't we organize counter-arguments? Some people write letters to support Carter's human rights, but isn't imperialism also violating human rights? How many people has imperialism killed? Imperialism helped Chiang Kai-shek kill many people in China. Imperialism has no qualification to talk about human rights. Why don't we use these living facts to educate the people? He sternly emphasized that it is completely correct to arrest the troublemakers who incite riots according to the law. Deng Xiaoping's speech first sounded the alarm for senior Party cadres and then transmitted to county and grassroots-level cadres, expressing the central government's stance.
On March 27, Deng Xiaoping discussed with Hu Yaobang, Hu Qiaomu, and others some of the main points and ideas he planned to emphasize at the party's theoretical work conference. He said, "We must adhere to four things: adhering to the socialist path, adhering to proletarian dictatorship, adhering to the Party's leadership, and adhering to the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is time to discuss these now..."
Deng Xiaoping said, ultimately, is socialist public ownership better or capitalist private ownership? As long as we do our work well, follow economic laws in our construction efforts, socialist public ownership will definitely be better than capitalist private ownership, and socialism will be better than capitalism. When talking about the leadership of the party, we should talk about history. Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China, and without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism. Every difficulty we have encountered has been overcome under the leadership of the party. We must speak about Chairman Mao. The evaluation of Chairman Mao is not prominent enough in the current draft; it lacks weight. Without the October Revolution and the acceptance of Marxism-Leninism, there would be no Communist Party of China and no new China. All of these are inseparable from Chairman Mao. It was Chairman Mao who put forward the theory of the division of three worlds, which freed us from international isolation. Proletarian dictatorship is necessary. We need to talk about the real conditions internationally and domestically, and we also need to prevent the restoration of capitalism.
Deng Xiaoping said: the issues of democracy and the rule of law need to be discussed. We need to talk about the relationship between democracy and centralization, the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, and the relationship between personal interests and national interests. When talking about democracy, we should analyze the activities of several illegal organizations to explain what socialist democracy is. The conclusion is: can we not adhere to the four principles? Can we not take a serious approach to dealing with bad people in society? This kind of argument may be more powerful and targeted. Too much vague language diminishes the emphasis and lacks persuasiveness and mobilizing power. We need to mobilize the masses to fight against these bad people. He also pointed out that democracy is democracy under highly centralized guidance, and centralization is centralized power based on high democracy. To promote democracy, we need to fully utilize the wisdom of the people and mobilize their enthusiasm. Only on the basis of democracy can we solve bureaucratism and the will of officials. However, without highly centralized power based on democracy, this cannot be achieved. When talking about the leadership of the party, it is emphasized that unified leadership and authority are necessary. Without the unified leadership of the party, there will be no efficiency. With the unified leadership of the party, as long as this leadership is correct, our adjustments will be fast, and the speed of construction will be fast. Without unity, no accomplishments can be made. Lenin stressed the importance of centralization and unity, and the importance of discipline. Our revolutionary war was also won under highly centralized and highly disciplined conditions.
Deng Xiaoping sternly pointed out that the Democracy Wall actually had an agenda. Those who use and promote democracy, use the Democracy Wall to engage in harmful activities, sell intelligence, and make foreign accusations should be banned. The few bad people should be separated from the masses. We need to mobilize the masses to fight against these bad people. Without stopping the troublemakers and opposing these bad people, there is no hope for the Four Modernizations. Most people are against the disruptive activities and absurd ideas of some illegal organizations in Shanghai and Beijing. They are advocating the same ideology as Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four". These people are afraid of peace and stability. We must tell people, especially the youth, not to be deceived by them. Their essence, ideology, organizational purpose are aimed at socialism, proletarian dictatorship, the Communist Party, and Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought.
In this speech, Deng Xiaoping also criticized the problems in the theoretical field. He said that the ideological and theoretical front cannot be said to have truly shifted the focus of work at present. There is a tendency to be obsessed with settling old accounts. There is less propaganda about the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, and there have been some statements that seem contradictory or even extreme. This is not good, it is not conducive to unity and progress, it is not conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people, and it is not conducive to wholeheartedly pursuing the Four Modernizations. Why not promote the good traditions of the Party? Traditional education includes discipline, diligence, and consideration of the overall situation. Theory should serve politics. The biggest political task in the country now is unity and progress, wholeheartedly striving for the Four Modernizations. We will encounter many difficulties in achieving the Four Modernizations, and the masses need to be prepared. Many new problems require theoretical research and answers, but we currently lack such theorists.
5. The formal proposal of the Four Cardinal Principles
On March 30th, on the third day after the resumption of the theoretical work meeting, Deng Xiaoping delivered a famous speech entitled "Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles" on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the Great Hall of the People.
This speech is highly targeted, but it does not discuss specific issues. Instead, it profoundly expounds on the unique political foundation and connotation of China's modernization construction.
Deng Xiaoping proposed adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles as a basic condition for achieving the Four Modernizations, and explicitly emphasized that the "Four Cardinal Principles" is one of the basic connotations of the newly proposed "Chinese-style Four Modernizations".
Deng Xiaoping pointed out that in the past, during the democratic revolution, we needed to fit the Chinese situation and follow the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside pioneered by Comrade Mao Zedong. Now, in construction, we also need to fit the Chinese situation and embark on a Chinese-style path of modernization.
To achieve the Four Modernizations in China, at least two important characteristics must be recognized:
One is a weak foundation. The long-term destruction by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has made China a poor and backward country. After the establishment of New China, we have made great achievements in economic construction. We have established a relatively complete industrial system and cultivated a group of technical talents. The average annual growth rate of our country's industry and agriculture from liberation until last year is relatively high compared to the world. However, due to the weak foundation, China is still one of the poorest countries in the world. China's scientific and technological strength is inadequate, and the overall level of science and technology is lagging behind advanced countries in the world by twenty to thirty years. In the past thirty years, our economy has experienced ups and downs, especially the great damage caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" from 1966 to 1976, which has had extremely serious consequences. Now we need to make adjustments in order to further eliminate these severe consequences.
Another issue is the large population and limited arable land. Currently, the national population is over 900 million, of which 80% are farmers. Having a large population has both advantages and disadvantages. Under the condition of insufficient development of production, issues such as food, education, and employment have become serious problems. We must vigorously strengthen family planning work, but even if the population stops increasing in a few years, the problem of a large population will still exist for some time. China has vast territory and abundant resources, but many resources have not been properly explored, extracted, and utilized, so they are not yet productive assets. Although the land area is vast, the arable land is scarce. It is not easy to change this situation, especially when there is a large population, particularly farmers. This has become a characteristic that must be considered in China's modernization.
Chinese-style modernization must start from the characteristics of China. For example, modern production requires fewer people, but with our large population, how can we balance both aspects? Without comprehensive consideration, we will face a long-term problem of insufficient employment in society. There are many issues here that require the joint research and practical work of all Party comrades in theoretical work. We will surely be able to find appropriate solutions.
Then, Deng Xiaoping turns the conversation around and points out that the central government believes that in order to achieve the Four Modernizations in China, we must adhere to four basic principles in ideology and politics. This is the fundamental prerequisite for achieving the Four Modernizations. The four principles are as follows: first, we must adhere to the socialist path; second, we must adhere to the dictatorship of the proletariat; third, we must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party; fourth, we must adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
Deng Xiaoping said, as we all know, these four basic principles are not new things. They are principles that our Party has consistently adhered to for a long time. Since the overthrow of the "Gang of Four" and the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, the series of policies and guidelines implemented by the Party Central Committee have always adhered to these four basic principles.
In practice and theory, we have criticized the false socialism advocated by the "Gang of Four", which appeared in the form of extreme leftism and widespread poverty. We have adhered to the principles of socialist public ownership and distribution according to work. We insist on self-reliance as the primary approach, seeking foreign assistance as a secondary measure, and learning and introducing advanced foreign technology to develop our socialist economy. We strive to act in accordance with objective economic laws. In other words, we adhere to scientific socialism.
We smashed the feudal fascist ideology of the "Gang of Four", rectified numerous injustices, resolved a series of historical problems, consolidated proletarian dictatorship, restored and promoted socialist democracy, especially after the Third Plenary Session, a lively political situation emerged that Comrade Mao Zedong had long hoped to achieve.
We restored the three major styles of the Party that had been destroyed, improved the Party's democratic centralism, strengthened the unity of the entire Party and the unity between the Party and the masses, thereby greatly enhancing the Party's prestige and strengthening its leadership over the country and social life.
We have eliminated the mental shackles created by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four", insisting that leaders are humans, not gods; we insist on mastering the scientific system of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought correctly and accurately; we insist on starting from reality and seeking truth from facts. This has restored the true nature of Mao Zedong Thought and upheld the esteemed status that Comrade Mao Zedong, as a great revolutionary, should enjoy in the history of the Chinese revolution and world revolution.
Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out that, despite this, the central leadership believes that it is still necessary to emphasize the promotion of these four fundamental principles today. On the one hand, there are some comrades within the Party who are still deeply influenced by the ultra-leftist ideology of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four". A few individuals even spread rumors and attacked the series of policies implemented by the central leadership since the defeat of the "Gang of Four", especially since the Third Plenary Session, claiming that they are contrary to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. On the other hand, there are a few individuals in society who are spreading doubts or opposing these four fundamental principles. And within the Party, some comrades not only fail to recognize the danger of this trend but even provide certain degrees of support, directly or indirectly. Although these groups of people are a small minority within and outside the Party, we cannot ignore their influence just because they are a small minority. The fact is that they have not only harmed our cause but also caused significant damage. Therefore, on the one hand, we must continue to resolutely eliminate the poisonous influence of the "Gang of Four" and help some comrades who are still affected by their poison to awaken, while giving a strong blow to the reactionary statements slandering the central leadership made by a few individuals. On the other hand, we must make tremendous efforts to fight against the trend that doubts the aforementioned four fundamental principles. Both of these trends violate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and hinder the progress of our socialist modernization.
Continuing on, Deng Xiaoping specifically refutes the trend that doubts or opposes the four fundamental principles from the right, expressing clear and profound viewpoints that are highly convincing.
In the conclusion, Deng Xiaoping particularly emphasizes that the central leadership believes that it is necessary to repeatedly stress the adherence to these four fundamental principles today because certain individuals (even if they are only a small minority) attempt to shake these principles. This is absolutely not permissible. Every communist, let alone every ideological and theoretical worker of the Party, must not have the slightest wavering on this fundamental standpoint. If any one of these four fundamental principles is shaken, then the entire socialist cause and the entire endeavor of modernization will be undermined.
In a historical turning point when the Party and the country were rectifying chaos and shifting the focus of work to socialist modernization, Deng Xiaoping, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, first clearly and comprehensively put forward the four fundamental principles and provided a profound and systematic exposition. Its significance is far-reaching and of great importance. Since then, the four fundamental principles have become an important theme in our country's political life, serving as the foundation for the formulation of various policies by our Party, and have continuously been enriched and improved with the development of practice. In 1982, the Four Cardinal Principles were officially incorporated into the Party Charter and Constitution, becoming the common will of the entire Party and the people of the country. The 13th National Congress of the Party regarded adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles as a basic point of the Party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism. The 14th National Congress listed it as the "foundation of the nation" and as a basic content of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The 15th National Congress established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the Party's guiding ideology and highly reiterated the Four Cardinal Principles as an organic component of Deng Xiaoping Theory. The Four Cardinal Principles summarize the long-term historical experience of our Party and country and serve as the common political foundation for the unity and struggle of the entire Party and the people of the country.
II. The "make-up class" for the discussion on the standard of truth
After the theoretical work conference, the wave of opposition to the Four Cardinal Principles from the right was quickly repelled. However, the long-standing state of ideological stagnation or semi-stagnation was difficult to overcome in the short term, and the "left" ideological tendency remained quite serious and became the main obstacle to rectification.
1. The proposal to discuss the problem of the standard of truth
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the promotion of democracy and the liberation of thought have just "started", but some people think that it has already "gone too far". Some people wrongly attributed the chaos that occurred in society at one time to the Third Plenary Session, believing that these chaotic phenomena were caused by the promotion of democracy and the liberation of thought. Some people have also set the Four Cardinal Principles against the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, believing that the Four Cardinal Principles are a "correction" to the Third Plenary Session. The various incorrect views that exist in the thinking of cadres indicate that the continued liberation of thought and the overcoming of the state of ideological stagnation are still a major long-term task of the ideological and theoretical front. At the same time, the above situation also indicates that the discussion on the problem of the standard of truth conducted before the Third Plenary Session has not been earnestly carried out in some regions and units, and has not deeply penetrated people's hearts, so a part of the people are still in a state of ideological stagnation and still start from the "textbook" in everything. Therefore, it is still very important and urgent to continue to carry out in-depth discussions on the problem of the standard of truth, further rectify the ideological line of the whole Party. In this context, various regions, while implementing the 11th Central Committee's Third Plenary Session's line and disseminating the spirit of the theoretical work conference, have proposed the issue of conducting a "make-up class" for the discussion on the problem of the standard of truth.
On May 21, 1979, the Liberation Army Daily published a commentator article titled "Unswervingly Continue to Implement the Spirit of the Third Plenary Session", which pointed out some ideological and understanding problems that occurred during the implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session. The article stated that the discussion on the problem of the standard of truth, which is the only criterion for testing truth, played a good role in promoting the liberation of thought, but this discussion did not take place in many units of the army. Why do we need to discuss the problem of the standard of truth? Why can't the criterion for testing truth be something other than practice? Why do we need to liberate thought and put the machinery in motion? If the thought is stagnant and starts from the "textbook", the vitality of the Party, the country, and the nation will come to a halt! Many comrades in our army have not understood it well. The article proposed, "Comrades in our army should make up for this lesson and re-study the documents of the Third Plenary Session." The article used the term "make-up class" and clearly put forward the requirement to "make up" for the discussion on the problem of the standard of truth. This was the earliest and most explicit proposal to conduct a "make-up class" for the discussion on the problem of the standard of truth.

In mid-May, Feng Wenbin, Vice President of the Central Party School, pointed out in his report to all students that the main obstacle to implementing the policies of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee is the problem of ideological rigidity among some cadres. He said, "Currently, the education on distinguishing between the two ideological lines is not widespread and not deep enough in many places. Some comrades say, 'The overall situation of ideological liberation is that the central government has taken the lead, some places have made some progress, but many places have not started yet.' Therefore, it is necessary to continue propagating the ideological line of dialectical materialism, liberating from the spiritual shackles of Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, and daring to think about new problems, propose new problems, and solve new problems in the new Long March."
In mid-May, the main leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Sichuan Provincial Committee stated in their speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Provincial Committee that from the ideological condition of the party, especially the senior cadres, it is relatively easy to unify thinking on adhering to the four basic principles, but it is still a major problem to continue to liberate thinking, especially to integrate Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought with the reality of the four modernizations, study new situations, and solve new problems. He said that the situation of ideological rigidity and semi-rigidity still exists within the party, and there are still some comrades who have lingering concerns that have not been resolved. It will take a long time and a great effort to resolve them. Therefore, he proposed that we should further study, propagate, and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee and integrate adherence to the four basic principles with the liberation of thinking.
In May, the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Anhui Provincial Committee pointed out at the provincial committee work conference that we need to distinguish between the mainstream and the tributary when looking at the situation. In the previous period, some people used the opportunity of promoting democracy and liberating thinking from the right-wing perspective to spread skepticism and denial of the four basic principles. There were also a few people in society who advocated anarchism and extreme democratization. This is the tributary. After conveying and implementing the speech of the leaders of the central government on "Four Insistences," this situation has quickly changed. We must not be confused by these tributaries. There is currently another incorrect trend denying the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. Some people seized upon these tributary phenomena and exaggerated them, attacking the party's line as "rightist" and claiming that the policies of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee were "biased." We must also pay full attention to these trends appearing in the guise of "leftist." This shows that the thinking of many people is still in a state of rigidity. Therefore, we must correctly understand the situation, firmly establish our political direction, continue to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, continue to liberate thinking, and deepen the discussion on the issue of truth standards. This discussion goes beyond any theoretical discussion on the ideological front since the founding of New China. It is a Marxist educational and ideological liberation movement of profound significance after the Yan'an Rectification Movement.
In May, the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Jiangxi Provincial Committee delivered a speech at the provincial committee work conference, calling on all party organizations at all levels in the province to adhere to the policy of liberating thinking, taking pragmatic actions, seeking truth from facts, and unity, and unite the ideological thoughts within and outside the party around the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee work conference believes that as long as we follow the decision of the Third Plenary Session, adhere to the ideological line that practice is the sole criterion of truth, adhere to deepening practice, investigation, and research, and follow the mass line, the current problems and difficulties can be completely resolved.
In early June, the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guangdong Provincial Committee pointed out at the cadre meetings at the provincial, municipal, and county levels in the province that we should pay attention to opposing the interference of incorrect ideological trends from both "left" and right-wing perspectives. Compared to right-wing trends, left-wing trends are more likely to confuse people and pose greater harm to us, so we need to be vigilant. The appearance of both left-wing and right-wing trends is not because the spirit of the Third Plenary Session has been implemented comprehensively, but rather because we have only initially implemented the spirit. It is the "beginning," not the "excessive." Therefore, we must continue to study the documents of the Third Plenary Session, and in many aspects, we need to supplement the discussion on the standard of truth. We must continue to educate on the ideological line of dialectical materialism.
The responsible person of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee that there are differences in views on the guiding principles and policies of the Third Plenary Session within our party and among cadres. A trend of doubt or opposition to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session has emerged. Some comrades believe that after the Third Plenary Session, "the policies went right". This misunderstanding is due to a lack of comprehensive and correct understanding of the guiding principles and policies of the Third Plenary Session, and the confusion between some problems that inevitably arise during the implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and the guiding principles and policies determined by the Third Plenary Session. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to emancipate our minds and eliminate the influence of the ultraleft trend among cadres.
The person in charge of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army also made a request to the whole army to continue to study and learn the lesson that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, and further eradicate the lingering influence of the ultra-leftist line of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four". Subsequently, the decision was made at the enlarged meeting of the Navy Party Committee to start a comprehensive and in-depth study and discussion on the lesson of practice being the sole criterion for testing truth, and to seriously address the issue of ideological line and supplement the discussion on the standard of truth.
3. The nationwide launch of the discussion and supplement of the lesson on the standard of truth
Some leaders at the central level, especially Deng Xiaoping, attached great importance to the discussion and supplement of the lesson on the standard of truth. On July 29, 1979, when he met with the participants of the enlarged meeting of the Navy Party Committee, he said: "At the beginning, there were many people who opposed the proposition that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, but the overwhelming majority of cadres and masses nationwide gradually accepted it. This debate is not over yet, and the Navy is considering making up for the lesson, which is very important. The discussion on the standard of truth is the foundation of construction. Without solving the problem of ideological line and emancipating the mind, a correct political line cannot be formulated or implemented. Therefore, do not underestimate the significance of the debate on whether practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Its essence lies in whether we adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."
In mid-August of the same year, Deng Xiaoping made an inspection tour to Tianjin. At that time, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was holding an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee. Deng Xiaoping listened to the work report of the members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee and made an important speech on implementing the guiding principles and policies of the Third Plenary Session, deepening the understanding of the party's political line, ideological line, and organizational line in the new era, and particularly on conducting in-depth discussion on the issue of practice being the sole criterion for testing truth. According to Deng Xiaoping's speech, the responsible person of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that to adhere to the party's political line of the Third Plenary Session, we must emancipate our minds and carry out a comprehensive discussion on the issue of the standard of truth. We must make great efforts to supplement this lesson from the municipal committee to grassroots units. Particularly, the leading comrades at the district, county, and bureau levels must study diligently.
On September 29, 1979, Ye Jianying delivered a speech at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In his speech, he proposed: "We must carry out widespread and in-depth study and discussion on the standard of truth throughout the country, on all fronts and industries, from leadership authorities to grassroots units, and education on the ideological line of dialectical materialism. Particularly, the main responsible cadres must take the lead in emancipating their minds and be resolute. The responsibility of the leadership lies in further guiding the thinking of the broad cadre masses towards realizing the political line of the Four Modernizations." This speech was discussed and passed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, so it can be regarded as the deployment and requirement of the central committee for the discussion and supplement of the lesson on the standard of truth.
Before and after this, all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and various troops of the People's Liberation Army, under the unified leadership and deployment of local or troop party committees, successively conducted "make-up lessons" on the issue of truth standards. Starting from the summer and autumn of 1979, the "make-up lessons" on the issue of truth standards were carried out nationwide and reached a peak in the autumn and winter of that year. This "make-up lessons" went far beyond the scope and depth of the discussions in 1978, especially going deep into the grassroots level, causing strong resonance among the vast number of grassroots cadres and masses, and forming a true and large-scale discussion. In fact, this large-scale discussion lasted until June 1981, when the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party made the resolution on "Several Historical Issues of the Communist Party of China Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China", essentially completing the rectification of ideological confusion and disorder, and thus concluding the "make-up lessons".
The "make-up lessons" on the issue of truth standards were not only a continuation of the discussions on the issue of truth standards in 1978 in the new situation, but also a widespread promotion of the Marxist ideological line and an further promotion and implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.
III. Through the Resolution on "Several Historical Issues of the Communist Party of China Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China"
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party carried out a large-scale rectification of the damage caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" in various fields during the "Cultural Revolution". At the same time, it also cleared and corrected some of the "left" mistakes that occurred before the "Cultural Revolution". Based on this, the Party conducted a comprehensive review and summary of the history of socialist revolution and construction since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and drafted and passed the Resolution on "Several Historical Issues of the Communist Party of China Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China".
1. The objective requirement to summarize historical experience and lessons
As early as the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC, Deng Xiaoping raised the issue of summarizing the history of the "Cultural Revolution". He pointed out that it is necessary to summarize the shortcomings and mistakes that occurred during the "Cultural Revolution" when appropriate, as it is necessary to unify the Party's understanding. The "Cultural Revolution" has become a stage in the development of China's socialist history and needs to be summarized, but there is no need to rush, a scientific evaluation of this historical stage requires serious research. Deng Xiaoping's opinion was accepted by the whole Party and included in the communique of the plenum.
After the plenum, the central leadership began to undertake specific work in this regard. In September 1979, just before the 30th anniversary of the founding of New China, the CPC Central Committee organized cadres engaged in theoretical work to conduct a comprehensive study and summary of the history of the past 30 years since the founding of New China, and drafted a speech, which was then widely solicited for opinions within and outside the Party. From September 25th to 28th, the CPC Central Committee held the Fourth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, where the speech drafted by Ye Jianying was discussed and passed.
On September 29th, Ye Jianying, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council, delivered a long speech at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of New China. He comprehensively reviewed the history of the past 30 years since the founding of New China and pointed out that our achievements over the past 30 years are great, and it is completely wrong not to see these great achievements. Of course, we know that the road we have traveled has not been smooth. We have experienced relatively smooth development as well as serious setbacks. Compared with the arduous efforts made by the whole nation and the superiority of the socialist system, our achievements are far from enough. We must carefully sum up the experience and lessons and strive for greater achievements.
Ye Jianying reviewed in his speech: After the founding of New China, within a short period of three years, we healed the wounds caused by the long-term war, successfully completed the remaining tasks of the democratic revolution, and while providing assistance in the Korean War, we restored the national economy to the highest level in the history of old China.
Then, in 1956, we successfully carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce, completed the development of the national economy and the first Five-Year Plan, and achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and construction. However, faced with tremendous victory, we became careless. In 1957, there was an error in responding to the attack by bourgeois rightists, which led to an expansion of the problem. In 1958, there was a violation of objective laws in guiding economic work, deviating from the principles of in-depth investigation, experimentation, and everything through trial, and committing errors of arbitrary command, exaggeration, and "communist wind". In 1959, there was an inappropriate struggle within the Party against so-called right-wing opportunism.
Regarding the "Cultural Revolution," Ye Jianying pointed out that the starting point for launching the "Cultural Revolution" was to oppose and prevent revisionism. For a ruling proletarian party, it must always be vigilant and prevent itself from embarking on the path of internal oppression of the people and pursuit of hegemony externally. The problem lies in the incorrect assessment of the internal and national situation at the time of launching the "Cultural Revolution" and a lack of accurate explanation of what constitutes revisionism. This also deviated from the principle of democratic centralism and adopted incorrect approaches and methods in the struggle. Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," as counter-revolutionaries, took advantage of this error to push it to the extreme and carried out a decade-long campaign of counter-revolutionary destruction in our country, resulting in a great catastrophe for the Chinese people and the most serious setback to the socialist cause since the establishment of New China.
After reviewing the history since the establishment of New China, Ye Jianying summarized the following lessons: (1) The fundamental purpose of socialist revolution is to liberate productive forces. Therefore, after the proletariat seizes state power and establishes a socialist system, the focus must be steadfastly placed on economic construction, vigorously developing social productive forces, and gradually improving people's lives. (2) It is necessary to make scientifically objective analysis of the domestic class conditions and class struggle situation after the establishment of the socialist system and adopt correct policies and methods. (3) It is essential to correctly understand the relationship between the masses, classes, political parties, and leaders, especially important in socialist society. (4) It is necessary to further improve party discipline and socialist legal systems, effectively safeguard the democratic rights of all party members and citizens, and institutionalize and legalize democratic and socialist democracy within the party.
Ye Jianying's speech above indicates that the Communist Party of China is an honest and great proletarian party that dares to acknowledge its mistakes. It also demonstrates that the Communist Party of China, after a long period of setbacks and mistakes, has correctly summed up its lessons and has become more mature.
2. Evaluate Mao Zedong correctly and have a scientific understanding of Mao Zedong Thought
At that time, when the central committee of the party was summarizing the history since the establishment of New China, it encountered a complex problem of how to scientifically and correctly evaluate Mao Zedong's successes and failures throughout his life. This is because, on the one hand, Mao Zedong was the principal leader of the Communist Party of China and the main creator of the People's Republic of China, and he had immortal merits in the Chinese revolution and the liberation of the Chinese nation, making him beloved by the Chinese people. On the other hand, Mao Zedong made serious "left" mistakes in his later years, which led to the occurrence of the disaster of the "Cultural Revolution." At the same time, how to evaluate Mao Zedong is an unavoidable issue when summarizing the history of the party since the establishment of New China. Whether or not we can evaluate such a leader is a key factor in whether the party's work of rectification and putting things in order can ultimately succeed.
After the Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as the rectification work progressed and the "left" mistakes were gradually corrected, especially with the in-depth discussion of the question of the criterion of truth, the long-standing personal superstitions were shattered. People no longer regarded Mao Zedong as a god, nor as a perfect and flawless revolutionary leader. At that time, there were two biases in how to evaluate Mao Zedong's merits and failures. One bias was that some people were still influenced by personal worship and refused to acknowledge the fact that Mao Zedong made mistakes. The other bias was that due to resentment towards the consequences caused by the "left" mistakes on the party, the country, their own families, or individuals, some people had an extreme mentality and attributed all the mistakes to Mao Zedong personally. Obviously, both of these biases are detrimental to making a correct evaluation of Mao Zedong, as well as to correcting the mistakes of the "left" and scientifically summarizing historical experiences. In response to the above situation, the Party Central Committee, especially older revolutionaries like Deng Xiaoping, called on people to emancipate their minds, break through barriers, and guide people on how to objectively and pragmatically evaluate Mao Zedong's achievements and mistakes and fully and accurately understand Mao Zedong Thought.
On March 30, 1979, in his speech "Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles," Deng Xiaoping addressed the erroneous trend of opposing Mao Zedong Thought that existed in society at that time. He pointed out that the series of victories achieved in the Chinese revolution and construction were inseparable from Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong made immortal contributions to the Chinese people. However, Mao Zedong, like anyone else, had his shortcomings and mistakes. When analyzing his shortcomings and mistakes, we should certainly recognize individual responsibility, but what is more important is to analyze the complex historical background. Only in this way can we approach history and historical figures with fairness, scientific rigor, and a Marxist perspective.
In August 1980, when answering a question from Italian journalist Fara Chi, Deng Xiaoping explained the evaluation of Mao Zedong by the Communist Party of China and its attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that Chairman Mao's achievements are paramount. He was the main architect of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China. His contributions to the Chinese people cannot be denied. He rescued the party and the people from crises multiple times. Without Chairman Mao, at the very least, the Chinese people would have had to grope in the darkness for a longer time. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our party. Mao Zedong Thought is primarily the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, but it is not solely his creation. The older generation of revolutionaries also participated in the establishment and development of Mao Zedong Thought.
Regarding the mistakes Mao Zedong made in his later years, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that some unhealthy factors and thoughts gradually emerged, mainly some "leftist" ideas. The errors started in the late 1950s. During his lifetime, Mao did not effectively carry forward good practices, such as democratic centralism and the mass line. He did not establish or form sound systems, which ultimately led to the "Cultural Revolution." Mao Zedong made political mistakes. These mistakes were not minor. On the other hand, these mistakes were exploited by the Lin Biao and "Gang of Four" counterrevolutionary groups. Their goal was to plot a power seizure. Therefore, we should differentiate between Mao Zedong's mistakes and the crimes of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four." Chairman Mao's mistakes are secondary; we must objectively analyze his later mistakes and continue to uphold Mao Zedong Thought.
From Deng Xiaoping's response to the journalist's question, it can be seen that the correct evaluation of Mao Zedong's achievements and mistakes by Chinese Communists formed a sharp contrast to the approach of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who completely denied the achievements of Joseph Stalin. This signifies the greatness and maturity of the Communist Party of China.
Subsequently, from March 1980 to June 1981, during the drafting process of the Central Committee's Resolution on Several Historical Issues Concerning the Party since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized the need to establish Mao Zedong's historical status and to uphold and develop Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that the evaluation of Mao Zedong and the explanation of Mao Zedong Thought are not only about Mao Zedong as an individual; they are inseparable from the entire history of our party and our country. Regarding Mao Zedong's mistakes, we must criticize them unequivocally, but we must also be objective, analyze various situations, and remain steadfast in adhering to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has educated an entire generation of our party. What we are now advocating, which is to correct the chaos caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," criticize the mistakes of Mao Zedong in his later years, and return to the correct path of Mao Zedong Thought, is a restoration of order.
Other older comrades, setting aside personal grievances, have made contributions from the standpoint of the party and the people's interests, and played an exemplary role in making a correct evaluation of Mao Zedong's achievements and mistakes.
Huang Kecheng is a veteran Communist Party member who has been persecuted for a long time since 1959 due to "left" leaning mistakes. He is a leader who was criticized and dealt with by Mao Zedong at the Lushan Conference, but he still highly affirms Mao Zedong's historical achievements. In November 1980, he discussed the issue of how to evaluate Mao Zedong and his ideology at a meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. He started by talking about history and reviewed Mao Zedong's significant contributions to the Chinese revolution. At the same time, he pointed out that we should have a correct attitude towards Mao Zedong's mistakes. If we attribute all the mistakes made by our party since the establishment of New China to Mao Zedong and let him bear the responsibility alone, it does not conform to historical facts. In the past, when liberating all of China and building New China, we, the old Communist Party members, all took responsibility and made significant contributions. If we now attribute all the mistakes to one person, it seems as if we had no part in it, which is unfair. We should all share the responsibility that we should share, which conforms to historical facts and materialism. Huang Kecheng emphasized: some comrades have said many extreme things about Chairman Mao, and some even speak as if he had no achievements at all. I think this is incorrect and not only fundamentally violates the facts but is also very detrimental to our party and the people. It is understandable that some comrades, especially those who have suffered setbacks and persecutions, have some passionate emotions. Everyone knows that I also faced some difficulties during Chairman Mao's later years. But I believe that for such important issues, we must not let emotions and personal grievances cloud our judgment. We can only proceed from the fundamental interests of the entire party and country.
Huang Kecheng's speech was later compiled into an article published in the People's Daily on April 10, 1981. His article had a tremendous social impact and deeply touched many people. If a comrade who has suffered so much hardship can impartially and justly treat history, what reason do others have to be emotional and vent personal grievances? It is precisely the spirit of pragmatism and broad-mindedness of the older generation of revolutionaries that has set an example for the whole party and the people to correctly evaluate Mao Zedong and understand Mao Zedong's ideology, gradually leading to a consensus among the entire party and the people.
3. Drafting and Adoption of the "Resolution on Party History Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China"
With the deepening of rectification work and the gradual consensus among the entire party and the people in evaluating Mao Zedong's merits and mistakes, the conditions for a comprehensive summary of the history of the Party since the founding of New China have gradually matured. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Party started drafting the "Resolution on Party History Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China."
Shortly after Ye Jianying's speech on the 30th anniversary of the National Day, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began the drafting work of the "Resolution on Party History Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" in November 1979. At that time, the work was led by the Politburo and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and it was chaired by leaders of the Central Committee such as Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang. The specific work of the drafting group was mainly carried out by Hu Qiaomu. Deng Xiaoping attached great importance to the drafting of the resolution and provided guiding comments on the draft and revisions several times.
In March 1980, the drafting group proposed a preliminary concept for the resolution. On March 19th of the same month, Deng Xiaoping put forward three opinions regarding the drafting of the resolution: (1) establish the historical position of Comrade Mao Zedong, uphold and develop Mao Zedong's ideology, which is the most essential point. (2) When analyzing the major events in the 30-year history of the People's Republic of China, it is necessary to conduct a realistic analysis of what is correct and what is wrong, including a fair evaluation of the achievements and mistakes of some responsible comrades. A basic summary of the past should be made through this resolution. This summary should be concise rather than detailed, aiming to guide everyone to unite and look forward. On April 1 of that same year, he also expressed his opinions on the overall design of the draft resolution and talked about his views on the 17-year history of China before the "Cultural Revolution" after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
On June 27, after reading the draft resolution, Deng Xiaoping further pointed out that the focus should be on what Mao Zedong Thought is and what are the correct aspects of Comrade Mao Zedong, while the wrong aspects should be criticized, but in an appropriate manner. Simply criticizing Comrade Mao Zedong's personal mistakes cannot solve the problem, the most important thing is an institutional issue. Deng Xiaoping's remarks showed his extraordinary ability and level of insight into problem analysis and observation as a great Marxist.
In October 1980, the draft resolution was discussed for 20 days among 4,000 senior cadres. During the discussions, everyone spoke freely, and many good opinions were expressed. However, some people still expressed extreme views during the discussions. For example, some suggested not writing about Mao Zedong Thought at all; that Comrade Mao Zedong was a Marxist and communist in the early period, but not in the later period; and some even believed that all the mistakes before the "Cultural Revolution" and during it should be solely the responsibility of Mao Zedong.
Based on this situation, Deng Xiaoping proposed during a conversation with senior party officials on October 25, 1980, that not mentioning Mao Zedong Thought and making inappropriate evaluations of Comrade Mao Zedong's achievements and mistakes would be unacceptable to old workers, poor and lower-middle peasants who underwent land reform, and a large group of cadres associated with them. Mao Zedong Thought is an indispensable banner. If we discard this banner, we would actually negate the glorious history of our party. The part of the draft resolution that expounds on Mao Zedong Thought cannot be omitted. This is not just a theoretical problem, but especially a political problem, which is a major political issue both domestically and internationally. If this part is not written or written poorly, the whole resolution would be better off not being done. Not writing or not upholding Mao Zedong Thought would be a historical and major mistake. When it comes to Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes, they must be criticized without any ambiguity, but it must be done objectively, analyzing various different circumstances. One cannot attribute all problems to personal qualities. Comrade Mao Zedong was not an isolated individual; until his death, he was always the leader of our party. When it comes to Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes, they cannot be exaggerated. Exaggerating them would not only tarnish Comrade Mao Zedong's reputation but also tarnish our party and our country. This goes against historical facts.
In March 1981, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the outline of the draft resolution could be established: the achievements of the first seven years of the founding of the People's Republic of China were unanimously recognized by everyone. The ten years before the "Cultural Revolution" should be affirmed, overall they were good, and they were basically developed on a healthy path. Although there were twists and turns and mistakes were made, the achievements were the main focus. As for the part about the "Cultural Revolution," it should be summarized. Compared to the mistakes in the previous 17 years, the "Cultural Revolution" was a serious and comprehensive error, with extremely severe consequences that still have an impact today. On April 7, Deng Xiaoping expressed his views on some issues during the "Cultural Revolution" to the responsible officials of the drafting group: (1) The legitimacy of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee and the Ninth National Congress should be recognized. During the "Cultural Revolution", our party still existed. (2) During the "Cultural Revolution", great achievements were made in foreign affairs. 
At the same time, Chen Yun also made important suggestions for the revision of the draft resolution. On March 24th, Chen Yun made two suggestions on the draft resolution: First, specifically add a section to talk about the history of the Party before the founding of the country and write about the Party's 60 years. This way, Mao Zedong's achievements and contributions will be summarized more comprehensively, establishing Mao Zedong's historical status, upholding and developing Mao Zedong Thought, and having a comprehensive basis. Second, it is suggested that the central government promote learning, with a focus on studying Mao Zedong's philosophical works. Deng Xiaoping attached great importance to this opinion. Two days later, he conveyed these two suggestions to the drafting group of the resolution. Before and after this, Chen Yun also made the following suggestions on the draft resolution: (1) Regarding the mistakes in the Party's work in the past 32 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it must be written accurately and the judgments must be in line with reality. It must be "finalized"; (2) Suggest adding a paragraph reviewing the history of the 28 years before the founding of the People's Republic of China; (3) Fully affirm Mao Zedong's historical achievements; (4) Write about the international help we have received. 
In May 1981, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Politburo invited more than forty people to discuss the draft resolution for twelve days. Based on the discussions, the drafting group made repeated modifications. 
On May 19th, Deng Xiaoping pointed out at an expanded meeting of the CPC Central Committee Politburo: The historical resolution document must be released as soon as possible, it cannot be delayed any longer, any delay is unfavorable. In order to release it earlier, the current method is to hold an expanded meeting of the Politburo. With over seventy people, spend some time and effort to scrutinize the draft more meticulously, make further improvements to it, and once it is decided, it can be mentioned at the Sixth Plenary Session, and the plan is to publish it on the occasion of the Party's 60th anniversary. 
Subsequently, based on Deng Xiaoping's suggestions, the CPC Central Committee Politburo invited over seventy people to discuss the draft resolution for twelve days. After the modifications, the opinions and suggestions of 130 representatives from various democratic parties were also sought, leading to further modifications and improvements to the resolution's content. In June 1981, the preparatory meeting of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee carefully and meticulously discussed the draft resolution. Deng Xiaoping made some important remarks on the draft resolution during the meeting. 
In this way, after more than a year, the draft resolution went through a process of drafting, discussion, and repeated modifications. Through extensive discussions that occurred four or five times, by drawing upon the collective wisdom, collective modifications, and the wisdom of the entire Party, the opinions of the majority of comrades gradually unified, achieving the goal of drafting the resolution. 
On this basis, the CPC Central Committee held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee from June 27th to 29th, 1981. The plenary session deliberated on the "Resolution on Some Historical Issues of the Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" (referred to as the "Resolution"). After thorough discussions, the plenary session unanimously passed this "Resolution". The "Resolution" applies Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism to provide a correct summary of the major historical events of the Party in the 32 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially the "Cultural Revolution".
The most important contribution of this historical document is as follows:
Firstly, it provides a truthful and scientific evaluation of Mao Zedong's historical position, fully explaining the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party. The "Resolution" points out that Mao Zedong is a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. Looking at his entire life, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. Mao Zedong has made indelible merits in the founding and development of our party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the victory of the cause of liberation of the people of all ethnic groups in China, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the development of our country's socialist cause.
The "Resolution" provides a full exposition of Mao Zedong Thought, stating that it is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China, and it is a proven correct theoretical principle and summary of experiences in the Chinese revolution. It is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. Many outstanding leaders of our party have made important contributions to its formation and development. Mao Zedong's scientific works are a concentrated summary of it. The scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought mainly includes the following aspects: the construction of the revolutionary army and military strategy; policies and strategies; ideological and political work and cultural work; and the construction of the party. In these constituent parts, the fundamental aspects that run through are "seeking truth from facts," "the mass line," and "independence and self-reliance," which are the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought.
The "Resolution" distinguishes Mao Zedong's errors in his later years from Mao Zedong Thought and states that it is completely wrong to deny the scientific value of Mao Zedong Thought because of Mao Zedong's errors in his later years. At the same time, it is also completely wrong to adopt a doctrinaire attitude towards Mao Zedong's speeches and to be unwilling to truthfully acknowledge his errors in his later years, and even attempt to adhere to these errors in new practices. It is necessary to distinguish Mao Zedong Thought, which has become a scientific theory through long-term historical tests, from Mao Zedong's errors in his later years. Mao Zedong Thought is the precious spiritual wealth of our party and will guide our actions for a long time.
The "Resolution" not only provides a scientific summary and definition of this first theoretical achievement formed by the party in the path of Marxist Chineseification, but also paves the way for inheriting and developing this theory, thus continuing to promote the cause of Marxist Chineseification.
Secondly, it provides a scientific summary of the history of the party, especially the 32 years after the establishment of New China. Regarding the seven years (1949-1956) of basically completing the socialist transformation, the "Resolution" believes that the guiding principles and basic policies determined by the party during this period were correct, and the victories achieved were glorious. The establishment of the socialist system was the most profound and greatest social transformation in the history of our country, and it became the foundation for all future progress and development in our country. Regarding the ten years (1957-1966) of starting comprehensive socialist construction, the "Resolution" believes that we have achieved great success but also suffered serious setbacks. All the achievements in these ten years were made under the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee with Mao Zedong as the leader. Later, due to various complex subjective and objective reasons, such as lack of experience, there were deviations in the analysis of the situation and the understanding of the national conditions, resulting in mistakes of subjectivism, expansion of class struggle, rashness and impetuosity in economic construction, including the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a comprehensive and long-lasting error. These mistakes have caused serious setbacks and losses to the socialist cause.
The "Resolution" completely negates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (May 1966 - October 1976). The "Resolution" points out that the Cultural Revolution has caused the most serious setbacks and losses to the party, the country, and the people since the establishment of New China. The main arguments put forward by Mao Zedong to launch the Cultural Revolution neither conform to Marxism-Leninism nor to the Chinese reality. The arguments referred to as "the theory of continuing revolution under proletarian dictatorship" were completely wrong in their assessment of the class situation in our country at that time, as well as the political situation of the Party and the state. History has already proven that the "Cultural Revolution" was an internal upheaval caused by the leaders' mistakes and exploited by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing factions, which brought disastrous consequences to the Party, the country, and the people.
The "Resolution" made the following evaluation of the two years of hesitation and progress after the elimination of the "Gang of Four" in October 1976: The victory in crushing the counter-revolutionary gang of Jiang Qing in October 1976 marked the beginning of a new period of historical development for our country. However, in the first two years, the strong demands from both within and outside the Party to correct the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution encountered serious obstacles. This was not only because the political and ideological confusion caused by the ten-year Cultural Revolution was not easily eliminated in a short period of time but also because at that time, Hua Guofeng, who was serving as the Chairman of the Party Central Committee, continued to make "left" mistakes in guiding ideology. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, held in December 1978, was a significant turning point in the history of our Party since the founding of New China. The Plenary Session ended the situation of the Party's work hesitatingly moving forward since October 1976 and began to comprehensively and seriously correct the "left" deviation in the Cultural Revolution and before it. A series of victories were achieved in rectifying the chaos, resulting in a favorable situation in both economic and political aspects of our country.
Third, the "Resolution" also pointed out for the first time that our socialist system is still in the primary stage and emphasized that our socialist system must go through a long process of moving from relative imperfection to relative perfection. This understanding represents progress compared to the past. Based on a correct summary of historical experience, it made a preliminary summary of the socialist construction path that suits China's national conditions and which the Party has gradually established since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. These are: (1) after the basic completion of socialist transformation, the primary contradiction to be resolved in our country is the contradiction between the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces. The focus of the work of the Party and the state must shift to the socialist modernization construction centered on economic development; (2) socialist economic construction must proceed from China's national conditions, proceed step by step, and in different stages, achieve the goal of modernization; (3) the transformation and improvement of the relations of production must adapt to the state of productive forces. The development of socialist production relations does not exist in a fixed model. It needs to create specific forms of production relations that are appropriate and conducive to continuous progress at each stage, based on the needs of China's productive forces; (4) after the elimination of the exploiting classes as class, class struggle is no longer the primary contradiction. We must oppose the view of expanding class struggle and also oppose the view that class struggle has been extinguished; (5) gradually build a highly democratic socialist political system, which is one of the fundamental tasks of socialist revolution; (6) socialism must have a high degree of spiritual civilization, striving to elevate the status and role of education, science, and culture in modernization construction; (7) improving and developing socialist ethnic relations has significant significance for our multi-ethnic country; (8) it is necessary to strengthen modern national defense construction, and national defense construction must be in accordance with the state's economic development; (9) in foreign relations, we must firmly oppose imperialism, hegemonism, colonialism, and racism, and maintain world peace; (10) the Communist Party of China must be built into a party with a sound system of democratic centralism. Although the specific expressions of these main points have changed in subsequent documents, their basic spirit and main content reflect the preliminary understanding achieved by the Party under new historical conditions in exploring the path of socialist construction.
The adoption of the "Resolution on Several Historical Issues Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" is of great significance for the Party's construction and the political construction of the country. It further unified the thinking and understanding of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, strengthened the unity of the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups, and marked the Party's victorious completion of the task of rectifying chaos in guiding ideology. This resolution immediately generated a strong response among the entire Party and the people of the whole country and received extensive and warm support. At the same time, the adoption and announcement of this resolution also had a significant impact overseas and internationally.
Chapter 4: The Proposal and Formulation of the Overall Reform Program for Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
I. The Proposal of "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"
From September 1 to 11, 1982, the Communist Party of China held the 12th National Congress in Beijing. This was the most important national congress in the history of the Party since the 8th National Congress.
The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee held in December 1978 put forward a series of major decisions that determined the future and destiny of the Party and the country. It criticized the erroneous policy of "two whatevers" and fully affirmed the need to comprehensively and accurately grasp the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. It determined the guiding principles of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and uniting for progress, decisively stopped using the slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link," and made strategic decisions to shift the focus of the Party's work to socialist modernization construction.
1. The Launch of Preparatory Work for the 12th National Congress
The transformation achieved at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee marked a fundamental breakthrough by the Party, breaking free from the long-term constraints of "left" mistakes, correcting the Party's guiding ideology, re-establishing the ideological, political, and organizational lines of Marxism, and putting an end to the situation of the Party's work wavering since October 1976. It laid the foundation for exploring the path of development that suits China's national conditions and the Party's basic line, and opened a new period for China's socialist modernization construction.
After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Party carried out large-scale rectification work, step by step solving many long-standing problems and new problems that emerged in practical life since the establishment of New China. Centered around the shift of the Party's and the country's work focus to economic construction, efforts were concentrated on developing social productive forces and carrying out the theme of socialist modernization construction in China, as well as heavy construction and reform work. How to further outline the blueprint for China's reform and opening up and modernization construction, and explore the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, has become a new topic facing the entire Party. The convening of the 12th National Congress of the Party was precisely in this context.
In order to successfully convene this Party Congress, the Party Central Committee made preparations for over two years. As early as February 1980, the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee officially decided to convene the 12th National Congress earlier and made provisions on the main agenda, allocation principles of delegates, and selection methods.
The Plenum believed that since the 11th National Congress, especially since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, there have been significant changes and developments in the domestic and international situation. With the shift in the Party's work focus, the cause of socialist modernization construction has begun to embark on a path of healthy development. The political, ideological, and organizational lines of the Party determined by the 3rd and 4th Plenary Sessions have become widely popular; the ultra-leftist line pursued by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" and their remnants have been further exposed and criticized; a large number of unjust, false, and wrong cases from history have been redressed, and the Party's policies have been widely implemented across the country. On this basis, the entire Party, army, and people are closely united around the Party Central Committee and working hard for the great cause of socialist modernization and the implementation of the guidelines for adjusting, reforming, rectifying, and improving the national economy. Progress is being made on various fronts such as agriculture, industry, finance and trade, education, science, culture, politics, national defense, and diplomacy; a stable, united, vibrant situation is developing. These facts prove that the Party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies are correct. Our country has basically transformed from the serious chaos caused by the unchecked activities of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" over the past ten years into a situation with leadership, order, direction, goals, favorable conditions, and confidence that has been achieved through overcoming tremendous difficulties – a great victory.
This plenum pointed out that the practice of the people of all ethnic groups in China advancing toward the Four Modernizations now presents our Party with a series of major issues that need to be promptly resolved in a timely manner, including determining the long-term development plan for the national economy, determining the economic system that suits the needs of national economic development, and determining the education plan and education system that suits the needs of national economic development. With the changes in the domestic situation, a series of important issues in the country's political and party life, as well as some important ideological and theoretical issues, also need to be resolved accordingly, in order to facilitate the development and consolidation of a stable, united, lively political situation, and to facilitate the smooth progress of modernization. In order to solve these urgent problems, the Central Committee is required to convene the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China earlier. The specific time for convening this congress will be determined by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.
This plenary session initially decided on the main agenda for the 12th Congress. It stipulated that there would be 1600 delegates attending the 12th Congress, and each electoral unit would elect alternate delegates in a proportion of one-tenth of the number of delegates. Each province, autonomous region, directly-controlled municipality, central government agency, central state agency, headquarters and military branches of the People's Liberation Army, and major military regions will hold party congresses or representative conferences, and through sufficient deliberations and differential electoral methods, delegates will be elected through anonymous voting.
Immediately after the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Party Central Committee started preparations for the 12th Congress.
Regarding the election of delegates to the 12th Congress, in order to do this work well, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee passed several opinions on the election of delegates to the 12th Congress in April 1980. According to the spirit of the resolution of the 5th Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, the document puts forward specific opinions on several issues related to the election of delegates, and requires party congresses or representative conferences at all levels to adhere to the principle of democratic centralism from beginning to end. Delegates attending the 12th Congress must be fully deliberated and elected through differential electoral methods with anonymous voting. Provincial and municipal party committees should strengthen leadership and hold good party congresses or representative conferences at the county and city levels. At the same time, preparations for provincial, autonomous region, and directly-controlled municipality congresses or representative conferences should be completed through sufficient deliberations, and a preliminary list of candidates for delegates to the 12th Congress should be proposed. The list of candidates for delegates should only be known to the leadership. The entire election work should fully reflect the opinions of the majority of delegates. The election work in various regions and units should be completed before the end of November.
In this document, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee also made principle provisions on the proportions of representatives from various sectors: women party members should account for about 15% of the total number of delegates; nationally renowned labor models and heroes should account for about 6%; professionals in science, culture, education, health, sports, etc. should account for about 15%; ethnic minority representatives should be no less than 5%. At the same time, it is also required that the delegates strive to be younger, with no less than two-fifths of delegates being under 55 years old.
The meeting of the Political Bureau also made a decision on "Not Appointing the Elderly Comrades Who Have Lost Work Capacity as Delegates and Candidates for Central Committee of the 12th Congress", pointing out: in order to ensure that the delegates attending this conference and the central committee members elected by the conference have a considerable proportion of comrades who are young and strong, so that the leadership of the party can meet the heavy tasks of socialist modernization construction, ensure the long-term continuity of the party's line, principles, and policies, and ensure the centralized leadership and long-term stability of the party, based on the suggestions of many older comrades and the masses inside and outside the party, and in accordance with the spirit of the 5th Plenary Session and the principles of the new Party Constitution (draft), the Central Committee has decided that elderly comrades who are already old and have lost work capacity and self-care ability shall not serve as delegates to the 12th Congress or candidates for the Central Committee. It is not difficult to see that this is an important step in abolishing the de facto lifelong tenure system for cadres and gradually renewing the leadership team.
On May 18-19, 1980, Hu Yaobang, at the conference on selecting excellent young and middle-aged cadres organized by the Central Organization Department, gave a speech on making preparations for the party congress. He pointed out that we should strive to make the 12th Congress of our party one of the best congresses since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said: To make it the best congress, there are three main criteria: (1) The line it formulates is correct; (2) The leadership team it selects is prestigious and satisfies the majority of comrades in the Party; (3) Its methods adhere to the principles of democratic centralism and fully implement the mass line. When it comes to how the elected representatives should truly represent, Hu Yaobang requested comrades in the organizational departments to seriously study and carefully examine. If they meet the requirements, they should become representatives, but if they do not meet the requirements, they should not be forced.
It is necessary to fully prepare and truly obtain the consent of the majority of party members, not just a few people. The list is not secretive and can be discussed among party members. Do not fear change, this is also dialectics. Through convening the Party Congress, democratic practices within the party can be carried out to strengthen the party's leadership and enhance party members' education.
According to the spirit of the Communist Party's 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee and relevant instructions from the central authorities, party organizations in various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, central agencies, and the People's Liberation Army have successively held party representative conferences or meetings to elect representatives to attend the 12th National Congress on schedule, completing the election work.
Another preparatory task for the 12th National Congress, that is, the preparation work for amending the party constitution, is also underway.
Starting from the winter of 1979, under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, relevant units of the central government have held several discussions with a group of cadres and conducted investigations and solicited opinions in many places across the country, resulting in a draft.
In January 1980, Deng Xiaoping put forward many important guiding opinions on amending the party constitution. Under the leadership of the Central Committee, a special group for amending the party constitution was established, with Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang as the leaders, and Hu Qiaomu responsible for specific work. The original draft was repeatedly discussed and modified to form the first draft of the revision. In February 1980, it was submitted to the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee for discussion and made the first round of modifications based on the discussions at the plenary session. In April, the Central Secretariat sent it to the whole party for discussion and solicited opinions from some non-party members. In May 1980, more modifications were made. In June of the same year, it was sent to party organizations at all levels, including provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, major military regions, and central party, government, and military departments, as well as all delegates attending the 12th National Congress, to solicit opinions. In July, the third round of modifications was made.
Based on the above preparations, the Politburo of the Central Committee held an expanded meeting in late July 1982 in Beijing. Over 130 central and provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal leaders attended the meeting. The meeting discussed some important issues related to the 12th National Congress.
On August 6, 1982, the CPC Central Committee held the 7th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The meeting was attended by 185 Central Committee members, 112 alternate members, and 21 attendees. The meeting was chaired by members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, including Hu Yaobang, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and Hua Guofeng.
At this plenary session, it was decided to convene the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on September 1st and publicly announced to the entire party and people nationwide the restoration of the good tradition of completely opening their own congresses in front of the Chinese people, just like what was done in the 8th National Congress, and abandoning the secretive approach used in the 9th National Congress. The plenary session reviewed and approved the report of the Central Committee on the 12th National Congress and the "China Communist Party Constitution (Draft Amendment)", and decided to submit these two documents for deliberation at the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party.
On August 30, the preparatory meeting for the 12th National Congress was held in Beijing. The conference determined four agenda items for the congress, elected a 12-member Presidium composed of 252 people, and elected Zhao Ziyang as the Secretary-General of the conference. Hu Yaobang proposed at the meeting that the task of the Twelve Congress is to make a victorious summary of the great historical turning points achieved in the six years since the defeat of the "Gang of Four," especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. At the same time, it will determine the grand goals and battle tasks of the party in the new period, so that our party can lead the people of all nationalities in the country to strive for the creation of a new situation in socialist modernization with a new appearance and strong combat effectiveness. The conference passed the "Decision on Confirming the Additions to the Central Committee at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the Fourth Plenary Session". The Presidium of the conference selected a Standing Committee of the Presidium composed of 31 people, including Hu Yaobang, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, Hua Guofeng, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Peng Zhen, Deng Yingchao, etc., and passed the examination report made by Song Renqiong on behalf of the Credentials Review Committee of the Twelfth Congress, and passed the conference agenda. At this point, all the preparations for the Twelfth Congress of the Party have been successfully completed.
2. The Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is held.
From September 1 to 11, 1982, the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing with great solemnity. The conference was attended by 1545 formal delegates and 145 alternate delegates, representing more than 39 million party members. The main agenda of the conference includes three items: (1) deliberating and approving the report of the Central Committee, and determining the guidelines for fully opening up a new era of socialist modernization construction; (2) deliberating and approving the new Constitution of the Communist Party of China; (3) according to the provisions of the new Constitution, electing a new Central Committee, Central Advisory Commission, and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
The conference was presided over by the Presidium and the Standing Committee of the Presidium. Representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals were invited to the opening ceremony. Deng Xiaoping, the executive chairman of the conference, delivered the opening speech.
In the opening speech, Deng Xiaoping reviewed the history since the Seventh Congress of the Party and explained the important historical position of the Twelfth Congress. He said, "The Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China held under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong in 1945 was the most important congress of our party during the period of democratic revolution after the party was founded. That congress summarized the historical experience of the twists and turns in our country's democratic revolution for more than 20 years, formulated correct guidelines and strategies, overcame erroneous ideas within the party, unified the understanding of the whole party based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved unprecedented unity of the whole party. That congress laid the foundation for the victory of the new democratic revolution nationwide." "Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has resumed correct policies in various fields of economy, politics, and culture, and has studied new situations and experiences, formulating a series of new correct policies. Compared with the Eighth Congress, our party now has a much deeper understanding of the laws of socialist construction in our country, and has gained much more experience. The consciousness and firmness in implementing our correct guidelines have been greatly strengthened. With ample grounds, we believe that the correct guidelines formulated by this congress will surely fully open up a new era of socialist modernization construction, make our party prosperous and strong, make our socialist cause prosperous and strong, and make our country and all nationalities prosperous and strong."
In this opening speech, Deng Xiaoping also summarized the party’s historical experience and put forward the guiding ideology of taking the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He proposed, "Our modernization construction must start from China's reality. Whether in revolution or construction, we must pay attention to learning from and drawing on foreign experience. However, copying foreign experience or foreign models can never achieve success. We have learned many lessons in this regard. We must combine the universal truth of Marxism with China's specific reality, follow our own path, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is the basic conclusion derived from summarizing our long-term historical experience." This basic conclusion is an accurate understanding and application of the objective laws of socialist construction in our country by the Communist Party of China. It is also the concentrated expression of the will, wishes, and requirements of all ethnic groups in our country. China's reform, opening up, and modernization construction have achieved great achievements and success under this ideological guidance.
In his speech, Deng Xiaoping accurately assessed the situation and proposed three major tasks facing the Chinese people in the 1980s: intensifying socialist modernization, striving for reunification of the motherland including Taiwan, opposing hegemonism, and safeguarding world peace. Among these tasks, the core is economic construction, as it forms the foundation for resolving international and domestic issues. Deng emphasized that in the coming long period, at least the next twenty years until the end of the 20th century, we need to focus on four key areas: carrying out institutional and economic system reforms, revolutionizing the cadre team by making it younger, more knowledgeable, and specialized; building socialist spiritual civilization; combating criminal activities that undermine socialism in the economic and other fields; and consolidating the party's style and organization based on a thorough study of the new party constitution. These are the most important guarantees for adhering to the socialist path and concentrating our efforts on modernization.
At the 12th Party Congress, Hu Yaobang delivered a political report titled "Fully Opening up a New Phase of Socialist Modernization Construction". The report comprised six parts: (1) Historical changes and new major tasks; (2) Promoting comprehensive growth of the socialist economy; (3) Striving to build a highly developed socialist spiritual civilization; (4) Striving to build a highly developed socialist democracy; (5) Upholding an independent foreign policy; (6) Strengthening the party as a strong core leading the socialist modernization cause.
The report reviewed the Party's journey since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee and the significant achievements across various fronts, while outlining the Party's overall tasks in the new historical period. These tasks are as follows: uniting all ethnic groups in the country, relying on our own efforts, working hard, and gradually achieving modernization in industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology, thus constructing our country into a highly civilized and highly democratic socialist state. Over the course of the five years between this congress and the next, we must vigorously promote the construction of both material and spiritual civilization of socialism based on the requirements of the overall task mentioned above. We should continue to improve socialist democracy and the legal system, conscientiously rectify the party's style and organization, and strive for fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation. At the same time, we need to work together with all patriotic people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas, to promote the great cause of national reunification. Furthermore, we must join hands with people all over the world to continue the struggle against imperialism, hegemonism, and for the maintenance of world peace.
Based on the actual conditions of our country and around the overall task, the report formulates strategic goals, strategic priorities, and a series of policy guidelines for China's economic construction. The report states that among the various tasks in fully opening up a new phase, the primary task is to continue pushing forward the socialist modernization of our economy and promote overall growth of the socialist economy. From 1981 to the end of the 20th century, the overall goal of our economic construction struggle is to strive for the total annual output value of industry and agriculture to double, from 710 billion yuan in 1980 to around 2.8 trillion yuan in 2000, while constantly improving economic efficiency. To achieve these strategic goals, it is important to address the issues of agriculture, energy, transportation, education, and science, considering them as strategic priorities. By solving these problems on a balanced basis, it will be possible to promote rapid growth in consumer goods production, drive the development of the entire industry and other areas of production and construction, and ensure the improvement of people's livelihoods.
To achieve the 20-year goal, the strategic deployment will be implemented in two steps: the first ten years will mainly establish a solid foundation, accumulate strength, and create conditions; the second ten years will usher in a new period of economic revitalization. This important decision was made by the Central Committee of the Party after a comprehensive analysis of China's economic situation and development trends. During the sixth Five-Year Plan period from 1981 to 1985, we must continue to resolutely implement the guidelines of adjustment, reform, rectification, and improvement, practice thrift, oppose waste, and shift all economic work towards focusing on economic efficiency. To concentrate efforts on adjusting various aspects of the economic structure, consolidate and improve the preliminary reforms that have been implemented in the economic management system, and urgently formulate the overall plan and implementation steps for the reforms. During the seventh Five-Year Plan period from 1986 to 1990, extensive technological transformation of enterprises should be carried out, and reforms of the economic management system should be gradually launched. At the same time, rationalization of enterprise organizational structure and various aspects of the economic structure should be completed. In the 1980s, a series of necessary basic construction in energy, transportation, and other areas, as well as a series of major scientific and technological projects, must be undertaken. As long as we effectively accomplish the above tasks, we can solve historical problems and lay a solid foundation for economic growth in the next decade. China's economic development in the 1990s will definitely be much faster than in the 1980s, and China's economy will enter a period of rapid growth in all aspects.
The report highly affirms the significance and role of constructing socialist spiritual civilization and emphasizes the need to strive for building socialist spiritual civilization. The report points out that while constructing a high level of material civilization, we must also strive to build a high level of socialist spiritual civilization. This is a strategic policy issue for socialist construction. Socialist historical experience and the current situation in our country tell us that whether we adhere to this policy will be related to the rise and fall, success and failure of socialism. The relationship between spiritual civilization and material civilization in socialist construction is very close. The construction of material civilization is an indispensable foundation for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Socialist spiritual civilization not only plays a huge role in promoting the construction of material civilization but also guarantees its correct direction of development. The construction of the two civilizations is mutually conditional and mutually desired. The report points out: Building socialist spiritual civilization is not an easy task, especially today. We must make the greatest efforts to adapt to the new conditions and circumstances of the construction period, and carry out the construction of socialist spiritual civilization conscientiously, inspiring the masses with revolutionary thoughts and spirit to construct socialism with great enthusiasm.
The report also points out that building a high level of socialist democracy is one of our fundamental goals and tasks. The report emphasizes that we must continue to reform and improve the country's political and leadership systems in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism, and expand socialist democracy to all aspects of political, economic, cultural, and social life. Develop democratic management in various enterprises and institutions, develop grassroots social self-governance, and closely integrate the construction of socialist democracy with the construction of socialist legal system, institutionalizing and legalizing socialist democracy.
Regarding our country's foreign policy, the report points out: Combining patriotism with internationalism has always been the fundamental starting point for us in handling foreign relations. We adhere to an independent foreign policy. China's foreign policy is based on the scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It starts from the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world. It has long-term and overall strategic basis and will never yield to temporary events or be influenced and incited by anyone. Under any circumstances, we will never seek hegemony. At the same time, the report also points out that our Party adheres to developing relations with communist parties and other working-class parties of all countries based on Marxism, according to the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs. Parties of all countries should respect and help each other. China should make a significant contribution to the world.
The report emphasizes the need to build the Party into a strong core for leading the socialist modernization cause. In order to strengthen the Party's construction in the new era, the Twelfth National Congress made many fundamental and significant amendments to the Party Constitution of the Eleventh National Congress. The general principles of modifying the Party constitution are to adapt to the characteristics and needs of the new era, put forward more stringent requirements for Party members, improve the fighting capacity of Party organizations, and uphold and improve the Party's leadership. The new Party constitution eliminates the "Left" mistakes in the Party constitution of the Eleventh National Congress and inherits and develops the advantages of the Party constitutions of the Seventh and Eighth National Congresses. The report pointed out that in order to make the Party the core force leading the socialist modernization construction, it is necessary to improve the Party's democratic centralism, improve the leadership structure and cadres system, realize the revolutionization, youthfulness, intellectualization, and professionalization of the cadres, and strengthen the Party's work among workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and closely connect with the masses. In three years, a planned and systematic Party reorganization should be carried out to fundamentally improve the Party's style.
Hu Yaobang's report focuses on the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics as the center, and outlines a blueprint for achieving this grand goal from various aspects such as politics, economy, culture, diplomacy, and Party building. Through the combination of theory and practice, Hu's report resolves a series of major issues in China's socialist revolution and construction and has attracted strong reactions from all aspects. From September 2nd to 4th, the delegates attending the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) spent three days in a heated discussion on the report. Everyone spoke their minds freely and the atmosphere of the meeting was very lively.
On the afternoon of September 5th, the Presidium of the Congress held a meeting. Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, explained the suggestions and opinions put forward by the delegates during the group discussions on the report of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC and the draft of the Party Constitution, as well as the modifications made based on these suggestions and opinions. The meeting approved the draft resolution on the report of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC and the draft resolution on the Party Constitution, and decided to submit these two draft resolutions to the Congress for approval. The meeting also decided to submit the list of candidates for the Central Committee, the Central Advisory Committee, and the Central Discipline Inspection Committee proposed by the Presidium for discussion by all delegates, and approved the election methods for these three committees to be submitted for the Congress' deliberation.
On the afternoon of September 6th, a plenary session was held. The Congress adopted a resolution on the report of the 12th Central Committee and approved the report made by Hu Yaobang on behalf of the 11th Central Committee. The resolution of the Congress stated, "The correct line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee have been effective in their work." "The correct outline and a series of guidelines and policies put forward in the report for comprehensively opening up a new phase of socialist modernization construction should be the basic basis for the Party's future work." The Congress also adopted the Party Constitution proposed by the 11th Central Committee and a resolution on this constitution. The resolution called on the Party to organize a serious study of the Party Constitution, make efforts to ensure that all Party members truly understand the general principles and provisions of the Party Constitution, and elevate the understanding of all Party members, especially cadres and Party members, so as to fully prepare for the comprehensive rectification of the Party's style and organization, and make the Party a strong core leading the socialist modernization construction.
Ye Jianying and Chen Yun delivered speeches at the Congress on the 6th, expressing their support for Deng Xiaoping's opening speech, Hu Yaobang's political report, and the Party Constitution of the CPC, and emphasizing the significance and principles of cooperation and alternation between new and old cadres. Ye Jianying said, "Our Party is a vibrant party. After this Congress, a group of young and capable comrades will take up leadership positions in the central and other leadership positions. This is an important symbol of the prosperity and development of the Party's cause. Our older comrades, seeing this situation, cannot help but feel joy." At the same time, he quoted the line from Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin, "The young phoenix sings more clearly than the old phoenix," to praise the young comrades sincerely and express his "hope that the young comrades who have just taken up their positions will cooperate closely with the old comrades, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and bravely move forward," surpassing the older comrades; and hopes that the retired old comrades will not retreat in their thinking and will continue to contribute to the Party and the people's interests in their practical actions, continuing to do work within their capabilities.
Chen Yun analyzed the situation of the Party's cadre team and explained the significance and principles of cooperation and alternation between new and old cadres. He said, "Solving the handover problem of cadres is an important task facing the whole Party. To solve this problem, firstly, old cadres must gradually withdraw from the leadership team. The old comrades who temporarily stay on the front line must handle major issues well and promote succession planning." He emphasized the need to promote thousands of young and middle-aged cadres to enter leadership positions at all levels. He emphasized, "We must promote thousands of cadres, instead of just a few dozen or a few hundred." Only in this way can there be enough cadres to replace the work of the old cadres. However, "those who followed Lin Biao and Jiang Qing in rebelling during the 'Cultural Revolution', those with serious clique mentality, and those who engaged in vandalism and looting, none of these 'three types of people' can be promoted, and those who have been promoted must be resolutely removed from the leadership team." He said, on one hand, we must promote boldly, and on the other hand, we must ensure political integrity. When comparing moral character and abilities, we need to pay more attention to moral character. In other words, we need to truly promote those who have a strong party spirit, a proper work style, and the courage to adhere to principles. He believes that as long as we solve the handover problem of the cadre team, our Party's cause will surely have successors.
On the morning of September 9th, the Presidium held a meeting to establish the official list of candidates for the three committees based on the preliminary selection results, and also passed the draft resolution on the work report of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. In the afternoon, each delegation held group meetings to discuss the list of candidates proposed by the Presidium.
From October 10th to the morning of the 11th, the plenary session was held to conduct the election of members of the Central Committee and members of the Central Advisory Committee. After thorough preparation, the plenary session democratically elected 210 members of the Central Committee and 138 alternate members, forming a new Central Committee. Among these 348 Central Committee members and alternate members, 211 were newly elected, accounting for 65% of the total. There were 171 members below the age of 60, accounting for 49.1% of the total. There were 122 members with a college degree, accounting for 35.1% of the total. In terms of knowledge and specialization, there was a significant improvement compared to the previous Central Committee. The Central Committee retained eight revered elder revolutionaries, including Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Peng Zhen, and Deng Yingchao, who had high prestige both domestically and internationally. At the same time, the Central Advisory Committee, which had never been established in the party's history, was newly formed, with 172 members elected. These members had over 40 years of party membership, made significant contributions to the party, and had rich leadership experience. The Central Discipline Inspection Commission elected 133 members.
The establishment of these three committees reflects Deng Xiaoping's "Reform of the Party and State Leadership System," which calls for the establishment of three committees and further implementation of the principle of alternating old and new cadres. It provides reliable organizational guarantees for strengthening and improving the party's leadership, for long-term stability of the party and the country, and for achieving a new phase of comprehensive socialist construction.
On September 11th, the 12th National Congress concluded, and Li Xiannian delivered the closing speech. He highly praised Hu Yaobang's report, the new party constitution, and the achievements of the congress. He called for the wide and in-depth promotion and study of the spirit of the 12th National Congress, and the implementation of practical measures to steadily achieve our great goals.
From September 12th to the 13th, the 12th Central Committee held its first plenary session. Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang presided over the meeting. The plenary session elected Wan Li, Xi Zhongxun, Wang Zhen, Wei Guoqing, Ulanhu, Fang Yi, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, Li Desheng, Yang Shangkun, Yang Dezhi, Yu Qiuli, Song Renqiong, Zhang Tingfa, Chen Yun, Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qiaomu, Hu Yaobang, Nie Rongzhen, Ni Zhifu, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Zhen, and Liao Chengzhi as members of the Central Political Bureau, and elected Yao Yilin, Qin Jiwei, and Chen Muhan as alternate members of the Central Political Bureau.
Hu Yaobang, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun were elected as members of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau.
Election of Hu Yaobang as the General Secretary of the Central Committee, Wan Li, Xi Zhongxun, Deng Liqun, Yang Yong, Yu Qiuli, Gu Mu, Chen Pixian, Hu Qili, and Yao Yilin as Secretaries of the Central Secretariat, Qiao Shi and Hao Jianxiu as Alternate Secretaries.
The plenum decided that Deng Xiaoping should be the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, with Ye Jianying, Xu Xiangqian, and Nie Rongzhen as Vice Chairmen, and Yang Shangkun as Executive Vice Chairman.
The plenum approved that Deng Xiaoping should be the Director of the Central Advisory Committee, with Bo Yibo, Xu Shiyou, Tan Zhenlin, and Li Weihan as Vice Directors, and Wang Ping and 24 others as Executive Committee members. It also approved Chen Yun as the First Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, Huang Kecheng as the Second Secretary, Wang Heshou as the Executive Secretary, and Wang Congwu, Han Guang, Li Chang, Ma Guorui, and Han Tianshi as Secretaries. Ma Guorui and Han Tianshi, along with 11 others, were designated as Executive Committee members.
The 12th National Party Congress was a very important meeting, with significant historical achievements and significance in the history of the Party and the socialist construction in our country.
3. The main contributions and historical significance of the 12th National Party Congress
This congress explicitly put forward the proposition of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Deng Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics has had great guiding significance for our country's reform and opening-up and socialist modernization.
First, the 12th National Party Congress successfully achieved the transition between the old and new leadership of the Party. Resolving the issue of the transition between old and new cadres, and achieving the revolutionary, youthful, knowledgeable, and professionalization of cadres as soon as possible, was one of the main topics of the 12th National Party Congress. From the history of the international communist movement, the issue of the handover of leadership at the top of the Party has always been a major event concerning the future and destiny of the Party and the country, but it is also a problem that has not been well resolved and has had painful lessons. The 12th National Party Congress actively and effectively explored this issue.
Second, the congress formulated and passed a new Party Charter. The Party Charter is the fundamental law of the Party. Our Party has attached great importance to amending and formulating the Party Charter in every representative congress. The 12th National Party Congress, in order to make the Party a strong core in leading the socialist modernization construction, and to significantly improve the political quality and fighting capacity of the entire Party, formulated a new Party Charter with distinctive characteristics. Its characteristics are as follows: it has a relatively substantial "general outline," which succinctly summarizes the nature of the Party and its overall tasks, and makes Marxist provisions on how the Party should correctly play its leadership role in national life; it sets higher requirements for Party members and cadres in terms of ideology, politics, and organization compared to previous Party Charters; based on historical experience and lessons, the new Party Charter emphasizes that all levels of organizations, from the central to the grassroots, must strictly adhere to the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership, and clearly stipulates: "any form of personality cult is prohibited." It makes many new provisions for improving the organizational structure of the Party's central and local organizations, strengthening Party discipline and the disciplinary inspection organs, and building grassroots Party organizations. The new Party Charter passed by the 12th National Party Congress embodies the wisdom of the entire Party and is formulated based on the Party's historical experience.
Third, the 12th National Party Congress enriched and developed Marxism on certain theoretical issues. Regarding the issue of the basic characteristics of socialism, the congress report of the 12th National Party Congress proposed that a new content, namely, socialist spiritual civilization and highly advanced socialist democracy, should be included. This way, the basic characteristics of socialism include not only the relations of production and the productive forces but also the superstructure and ideology, making them more comprehensive and complete. Regarding the issue of the structure of socialist ownership, the congress report of the 12th National Party Congress pointed out that state-owned economy occupies a dominant position in the national economy as a whole but, for a long period, a variety of forms need to coexist. Regarding the issue of socialist planning and the market, previous discussions often emphasized planning and excluded the market. The 12th National Party Congress put forward the principle of giving priority to planned economy and regulating it with the market. Under this principle, the scope and boundaries of directive planning, guiding planning, and market regulation should be correctly defined. In the issue of class struggle during the socialist era, the 12th Party Congress report put forward that after the elimination of the exploiting class as a class, most of the contradictions existing in our society do not have the nature of class struggle. Class struggle is no longer the principal contradiction in our society, but class struggle will still exist in a certain scope and may intensify under certain conditions. In addition, the 12th Party Congress report also provides new explanations on issues such as the construction of spiritual civilization and party building. These new understandings enrich and develop the treasure trove of Marxist theory.
Fourth, the 12th Party Congress scientifically summarized the Party's historical experience, formulated grand goals and a more complete series of correct principles, policies, and measures to create a new phase of socialist construction based on the current situation in our country. It established the Party's overall tasks and general line for the new historical period. It simultaneously ranks economic construction, political construction, and ideological and cultural construction as the objectives of socialist construction, which is the first time in the history of socialist construction in our country and a pioneering move in the international communist movement. The 12th Party Congress fully initiated a new phase of socialist modernization construction in our country. After the 12th Party Congress, China's reform and opening up and the cause of socialist modernization construction entered a period of vigorous development.
II. The formulation of the economic system reform agenda and the comprehensive launch of the reform and opening up
With the advancement of rural and urban economic reforms, the content of the reform has greatly exceeded the original scope of developing commodity production and exchange. It has increasingly revealed the orientation of developing a commodity economy and market regulation, further touching upon the core of the planned economic command system. This has exposed some deeper contradictions and problems, leading to intense debates. The focus of the debate is whether China's current economy is a commodity economy and whether an economic system adapted to a commodity economy should be established.
1. The clash over the theory of "socialist commodity economy"
At that time, many people believed that the socialist economy is a planned economy, not a commodity economy. Since it is a planned economy, the economic system should be compatible with a planned economy. This opinion is, of course, in a morally advantageous position because, in the eyes of many, there are already a large number of discussions in Marxist classics. By quoting the words of the "forefathers," one already has sharp theoretical weapons. The argument that "socialism is a commodity economy" cannot withstand a refutation.
However, both before and after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, many economists insisted on the concept of a "commodity economy." Going back earlier, in 1959, Wang Xuewen and Qi Qi jointly published an article in Economic Research, proposing "a planned development of the commodity economy." After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in the spring of 1979, Zhuo Jiong, an old generation of economists in Guangdong, wrote an article that decisively stated: "Abandon a planned economy and develop a commodity economy." In the same year, at a symposium on socialist economic value law held in Wuxi, Hu Zhaopei, a professor at Xiamen University, clearly stated the viewpoint that "the socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership." In 1979, Deng Liqun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, published an article in Finance and Trade Economics advocating that the current stage of the socialist economy is a commodity economy.
In October 1979, the Preliminary Opinions on the Overall Plan for Economic System Reform issued by the Reform Small Group of the State Council's Finance and Economics Commission explicitly stated: China's current stage of socialist economy is a commodity economy with the dominance of public ownership of the means of production and the coexistence of multiple economic components. An economic system adapted to it must be established. Although this statement has added two attributes before it, it clearly states that establishing an economic system compatible with the commodity economy is the goal of the reform. According to Professor Yang Qixian, who participated in the drafting, this statement was added by Xu Muqiao.
During this period, Chen Yun was also contemplating how to reform the planned economic system. In March 1979, he summarized in the "Outline of Plan and Market Issues": "The main shortcomings in the planning systems of the Soviet Union and China for the past sixty years are that there is only 'planned proportionality' and there is no requirement for market regulation under the socialist system. The so-called market regulation refers to the adjustment according to the law of value. In certain aspects of economic life, it can be regulated by the methods of 'non-government' and 'blind' production." This was the earliest expression within the party of the need for market regulation under the planned economic system, and throughout the 1980s, the discussion of the relationship between planning and market, and their respective proportions, became the mainstream discourse within the party and the theoretical community. In 1981, Chen Yun summarized this expression as "planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as the supplement."
The debate between the economic and ideological circles regarding planned economy versus commodity economy has been ongoing. However, in 1982, the situation underwent a sudden change. In early May of that year, the National Economic System Reform Office (later renamed the Economic System Reform Commission in 1983) and the Economic Center of the State Council jointly held a large-scale seminar to discuss theoretical issues related to economic reform. The seminar was divided into eight groups, with over two hundred participants. The main theme of this seminar was to affirm planned economy and consider it as the socialist economic system. Although some scholars pointed out that commodity economy is a theoretical generalization of real-life, and that commodity production and exchange are the fundamental elements of commodity economy without essential differences, the dominant opinion believed that while commodity production and exchange exist in socialist society, it does not mean that there is a commodity economy.
Since no new theoretical progress was made, the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in September 1982, emphasized the principle of "planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as the supplement" in its political report, stating: "China implements a planned economy on the basis of public ownership. Planned production and circulation are the mainstay of China's national economy." "For the production and distribution of production materials and consumer goods that are related to the national economy in state-owned enterprises, especially for key backbone enterprises that affect the overall economy, mandatory planning must be implemented... For collectively owned enterprises, some mandatory targets should also be issued according to needs."
The 12th National Congress confirmed that China still implements planned economy and must implement mandatory planning and targets, which was an inevitable stage of understanding during the initial phase of China's reform when they were "crossing the river by feeling the stones." In this situation, the theory of "commodity economy" naturally fell into an awkward position. In 1982 and 1983, criticisms of the terms "socialist commodity economy" and "planned commodity economy" increasingly intensified in newspapers.
Some scholars believed that "as the basic characteristic of the socialist economy, it should be a planned economy, not a commodity economy." "The starting point of a planned commodity economy is still a commodity economy. The concept of 'planned' is abstract; since planned economy no longer exists, where does the concept of 'planned' come from?"
Other scholars believed that "if we generalize our economy as a commodity economy, it will blur the essential differences between socialist economy and capitalist economy." "The essential characteristic of a socialist economy can only be a planned economy... Demeaning the socialist economy to a 'commodity economy' can only be a historical regression. In fact, without planned economy, there can be no socialism." 
Of course, there were also scholars who believed that considering the presence or absence of mandatory planning as an important criterion for distinguishing between socialist planned economy and capitalist market economy was correct.
For a time, newspapers and public opinions were filled with strong criticisms against the theory of "commodity economy." Xue Muqiao, who advocated the theory of "commodity economy," was even criticized for having "the vices of intellectuals." After intense criticism, Xue Muqiao finally made concessions and proposed that "the most important characteristic of a socialist economy is not the commodity economy, but a planned economy based on public ownership of the means of production, with the existence of commodity production and exchange." 
On September 6, 1982, Liu Guoguang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, published an article titled "Adhering to the Basic Direction of Economic System Reform" in the People's Daily, emphasizing the importance of guiding plans and relatively reducing the scope of command plans. On September 21, the People's Daily, on behalf of the commentator, published a long article on the front page criticizing Liu Guoguang without naming him. 
The article repeatedly emphasized the importance of command plans, stating that "the use of the market is not equal to market regulation" and argued that "command plans are not only necessary in specific situations when the national economy is adjusting, but also necessary for the production and distribution of products that are vital to the nation's economy, as well as for the operation of backbone enterprises under general conditions. In fact, it is the key to the principle of planned economy as the mainstay and market regulation as the supplement." Liu Guoguang's article was submitted to the People's Daily before the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was published just before the Congress, contradicting the spirit of the political report of the Congress. From autumn 1982 to 1983, the forces defending command plans were quite strong. Deng Liqun, who had advocated for the "commodity economy" in an article written in 1979, also joined the ranks of criticizing the commodity economy.
In fact, the reason for the high-profile criticism of the commodity economy in 1982 and 1983 was largely due to a macro interpretation of China's economy after the 12th National Congress, namely the relationship between market regulation and planned economy, which was likened to the relationship between a bird and a cage. If the bird represents a vibrant economy, then the cage is the national plan. An active economy and market regulation can only play a role within the scope of planned permission and cannot be separated from the guidance of the plan. This is equivalent to saying that the ongoing reform of state-owned enterprises is a "reform within the cage." Another political background was the anti-"spiritual pollution" campaign in 1983. At that time, some people criticized the advocacy of the "commodity economy theory" as "spiritual pollution". Fortunately, this deviation was quickly corrected by the central government. The process of China's reform always unfolds in the midst of "mountains and rivers with no way out" and opens up new horizons of "a bright village amidst dark green willows." While the criticism of the commodity economy was at its peak, a new situation was brewing.
2. Differences and Breakthroughs in the Reform of the Plan Management System
In 1983, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council prepared to advance the strategy of "macro reforms first" comprehensively. Where should the starting point for macro reforms be? It was chosen in the "command system of the planned economy system," which is the plan management system. As the plan management system controls the overall situation of the planned economy system, reforming the plan management system first becomes the starting point for advancing the strategy of "macro reforms first" comprehensively.
From August to December 1983, under the leadership of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, the Reform Leadership Group for the Plan Management System was established, and a working group for the reform of the plan management system was set up. The main members of the working group were from the State Planning Commission and the State Council's Reform Commission, with an office located in the southern district guardhouse in Zhongnanhai. The task of the working group for the reform of the plan management system was to propose reform plans. This work was carried out from August to December 1983, but due to divergent opinions and significant differences between different views, most of the time was spent on debates.
In the great debate, two representative opinions stood out:
The first opinion is that state-owned enterprises should expand their autonomy in production and management, expand the scope of market regulation, and implement profit and loss responsibility. This requires reducing the scope of directive plans and corresponding pricing of state-priced products.
The second opinion mainly emphasizes two points: (1) All important products related to the national economy, whether they are in shortage or surplus, should be subject to directive planning. The scope of directive planning should not be reduced. (2) State-owned enterprises cannot implement profit and loss responsibility or relative profit and loss responsibility. The reason is that if state-owned enterprises implement profit and loss responsibility, they will not be willing to accept low-priced directive production plans and product allocation plans.
The debate is very intense and in-depth. Economist Wang Zhuo, who participated in this discussion, also recalled several incidents that occurred during the discussion process:
The first incident was when Népszabadság, known as the father of Hungarian reform, visited our country. When he visited the State Planning Commission, some people from the Commission asked him: Did Hungary truly abolish the directive planning? Some of the people present clearly expressed doubts about this. When Népszabadság visited the Ministry of Materials and other ministries, some units also raised similar questions, revealing doubts about Hungary's abolition of directive planning. Népszabadság was deeply puzzled by this and when he went to the State Council's Office for Economic Reform, he asked: Why don't some of your ministries believe in Hungary's reform of abolishing directive planning? He expressed regret about this! This incident shows that at that time, the various ministries of the central government generally disagreed with the reform of reducing the scope of directive planning, let alone canceling it.
The second incident occurred during a reporting meeting attended by leaders of a ministry. A person specifically mentioned that Wang Zhuo had proposed the argument of commodity production during the discussion. At that time, anyone who advocated the development of commodity production was considered a heretic. Wang Zhuo was about to speak in response. Liao Jili, from the State Council's Office for Economic Reform, immediately protected Wang Zhuo and said, "That's not the case," and countered the attacking opinion of that comrade. Wang Zhuo didn't need to speak anymore.
The third incident occurred at the same meeting when a somewhat famous economist spoke against the reform of reducing the scope of directive planning. After the meeting, some comrades had various discussions and accused him of being a verbal reformist who changes his original argument as soon as the "political winds" shift.
The fourth incident was that several different opinions discussed within the planning management system reform working group, which were initially meant to be internal discussions, were later known to comrades outside the group. Based on this, someone from the Central Party Policy Research Office wrote a letter to the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, saying that there are people rekindling the debate on directive planning. This was originally a debate on reform issues, but it was painted with a political color, preventing this beneficial debate from achieving the expected results.
After several months of work, the planning management system reform working group finally produced a draft document that compromised between the two opinions. After the meeting, it was revised multiple times but ultimately failed to become a decent document. However, the macro-strategy for reform has not failed, and the "Great Debate" has not ended. In 1984, this Chinese reform project continued and achieved breakthrough results. This was the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform" passed at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 20, 1984. This decision recognized for the first time that China was implementing a "planned commodity economy."
3. Drafting and Adoption of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform"
The members of the drafting group of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform" were selected from the team responsible for drafting the government work report of the Sixth National People's Congress. They included Yuan Mu, Gao Shangquan, Gui Shipu, Wang Renzhi, Xie Minggan, Yang Qixian, and others. Yuan Mu initially took charge and drafted an outline. The outline was discussed multiple times, but it always remained within the circle of "planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as the supplement." At this point, some of them believed that in order to break free from this circle, there had to be a breakthrough in the issue of a commodity economy, specifically changing the target model of reform from "planned economy as the mainstay, market regulation as the supplement" to "planned commodity economy." However, there were divergent opinions within the drafting group on this issue.
In July and August 1984, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Beidaihe. Under the leadership of Hu Yaobang, the drafting group discussed the outline twice. Hu Yaobang was not satisfied with the outline. He emphasized repeatedly that this was a historic document and must be well-written. He also stated that the opinions of Zhao Ziyang on economic issues had to be considered, and proposed including the development of multiple economic elements. Hu Yaobang strengthened the drafting group by adding Lin Jianqing, Lin Zili, Gong Yuzhi, Zheng Bijian, and others. Lin Jianqing took over as the leader from Yuan Mu.
After returning from Beidaihe to Yubei Mountain in Beijing, both Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang separately presided over discussions. When discussing the relationship between planning and the market, Zhao Ziyang said, "I am inclined to write about a planned commodity economy." During this period, many people made suggestions to Zhao Ziyang. For example, in August, more than ten economists such as Dong Fuchu, Tong Dalin, and Yu Guangyuan held a conference at Beijing Baiwanzhuang, strongly advocating for the inclusion of the term "planned commodity economy." They wrote a conference brief to Zhao Ziyang, stating their reasons. It can be seen that Zhao Ziyang's preliminary establishment of the term "planned commodity economy" took into account opinions from various sources.
Zhao Ziyang also convened the drafting group for two discussions in Zhongnanhai. During the last discussion, in addition to the members of the drafting group, Deng Liqun was also invited. Zhao Ziyang asked everyone, "Are there any theoretical problems?" Yang Qixian replied, "Theoretically, it holds up." Zhao Ziyang asked again, "Is there any contradiction with the constitution?" Zheng Bijian replied, "There is no contradiction." "There is no mention in the constitution of 'planned economy as the mainstay, with market regulation as auxiliary'." Zhao Ziyang announced the adjournment of the meeting, and people stood up to prepare to leave. Zhao Ziyang asked Deng Liqun, "Old Deng, what do you think?" Deng Liqun replied, "I proposed this back in 1979." Sometimes the details of history are thought-provoking.
On September 9th, Zhao Ziyang wrote letters to Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, and Chen Yun, suggesting that China's economic system be summarized as follows:
(1) China implements a planned economy, not a market economy.
(2) Spontaneous and blind production and exchange regulated by the market are limited to small commodities, three types of agricultural and sideline products, and service and repair industries, which play a complementary role in the overall national economy.
(3) Planned economy does not mean that command planning is dominant. Both command planning and guiding planning are specific forms of planned economy... In the current and future a considerable period of time, our policy should be to gradually reduce command planning and expand guiding planning.
(4) Guiding planning mainly uses economic means for regulation, and command planning must also consider the role of economic laws, especially the law of value. The socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership. Planning must be realized through the law of value and rely on the law of value to serve planning. The expression "planning first, law of value second" is not accurate and should not be continued in the future...
Zhao Ziyang's letter quickly received the approval of the four members of the Politburo Standing Committee. On September 11th, about 1500 people were convened by the central government to discuss the draft for soliciting opinions. The attendees included central committee members, alternate committee members, central advisory committee members, central disciplinary commission members, main responsible comrades from various central departments, responsible comrades from provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and major military regions, as well as leaders from 26 major enterprises. Through discussions, the participants strengthened their understanding of the necessity and urgency of economic system reform, especially urban system reform. They agreed to include "planned commodity economy" in the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform" (referred to as the "Decision") at the Third Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee. At the same time, the title of Part IV of the original draft, "Reform Planning System, Conscious Application of the Law of Value," was changed to "Conscious Application of the Law of Value in the Planning System, Developing a Socialist Commodity Economy."
"But including it in the decision does not mean that everyone's thinking has been clarified." Yang Qixian said that due to ongoing controversies, the day before the formal writing of the "Decision," a sentence was added: "However, under socialist conditions, labor, banks, land, and mines are not commodities." This actually means that the commodity economy is limited to the production of products and does not include production factors. It is not a complete commodity economic system.
The "Decision" passed at the Third Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee on economic system reform clarifies the necessity and urgency of accelerating the reform of the entire economic system with a focus on cities. It sets the direction, nature, tasks, and basic principles and policies for the reform.
The most significant contribution of this "Decision" is breaking through the traditional notion of opposing planned economy with commodity economy and confirming that our country's socialist economy is a "planned commodity economy based on public ownership." The reform in our country is the self-improvement and development of the socialist system. The basic task of the reform is to further implement the policy of revitalizing the economy internally and opening up externally, gradually establish a socialist economic system with Chinese characteristics, full of vitality and vigor, and promote the development of social productive forces.
The "Decision" clearly states the main issues that need to be addressed in relation to the basic tasks of reform, namely establishing a dynamic socialist economic system; enhancing enterprise vitality as the central focus of economic system reform; establishing a planned system that conscientiously applies the law of value and developing a socialist commodity economy; establishing a rational price system and giving full attention to the role of economic leverage; implementing the separation of government and enterprise responsibilities and correctly playing the role of government institutions in managing the economy; establishing various forms of economic responsibility systems and earnestly implementing the principle of distribution according to work; actively developing various forms of the economy and further expanding economic and technological exchanges with foreign and domestic sources; employing a new generation, cultivating a large contingent of socialist economic management cadres; and strengthening party leadership to ensure the smooth progress of reform.
This "Decision" makes the direction, tasks, and requirements of China's reform more clear and is a programmatic document guiding the comprehensive implementation of economic system reform in our country. Although it does not explicitly propose the establishment of a socialist market economic system as the reform goal, the proposal of a planned commodity economy target based on public ownership already implies a clear market orientation, which is a significant breakthrough in socialist economic theory. Deng Xiaoping highly praised this, believing that it was "the combination of basic principles of Marxism and socialist economic practice in China."
Practice has proven that the release and implementation of the "Decision on Economic System Reform" at the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee was another liberation of the thinking of the cadres and the masses. After this plenary session, economic system reforms focusing on cities began to gradually unfold in areas such as expanding enterprise autonomy, conducting pilot projects for a shareholding system, reforming ownership structures, changing employment systems, and implementing factory director responsibility systems.
III. Clarify the themes of the times and the development of foreign relations
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, when the party and the state shifted their focus to socialist modernization centered on economic construction, foreign affairs, like other work, served the central task of economic construction and the key point of socialist modernization. In order to adapt to this need, the party and the state made adjustments to their foreign relations strategies.
1. Adjustment of international strategy and foreign policy
With economic construction as the center, there is a need for a favorable external environment, namely a peaceful international environment. How to create a peaceful international environment is subject to various factors. How to correctly analyze and assess the international situation and adopt the correct foreign relations strategies and policies is an extremely important aspect.
(1) Preliminary adjustments by Chinese leaders to their understanding of war and peace. When New China was just established, in order to resist and break the United States' hostility, isolation, and blockade, the Chinese government pursued a "leaning to one side" foreign policy and formed an alliance with the Soviet Union. This was necessary given the international environment at the time. In the late 1950s, the Soviet Union pursued great-power chauvinism and forced China to accept demands that compromised Chinese sovereignty, exerting political, economic, and military pressures that rapidly deteriorated Sino-Soviet relations. By the 1970s, the United States, one of the two superpowers, was strategically retreating due to its weakening in the Vietnam War, while the Soviet Union, at a stage of increasing military strength, took advantage of the situation to expand its influence on a global scale, posing a serious threat to global peace and China's security. In response to this international situation, the Chinese government adjusted its foreign policy and adopted a "one line" diplomatic strategy of simultaneously allying with the United States and resisting the Soviet Union. This strategy not only effectively safeguarded China's own security but also greatly curbed the momentum of global expansion by the Soviet Union.
After the end of the Cultural Revolution, how to analyze and judge the international situation and formulate foreign strategies and policies based on these became a major issue in China's foreign relations. In December 1977, the Central Military Commission held a meeting, and Chairman Hua Guofeng of the Communist Party of China made a speech regarding the international situation, especially the issue of war and peace. He believed that because imperialist and social-imperialist systems inherently breed war, the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States, sooner or later, will erupt into a world war. Therefore, a world war is unavoidable, sooner or later it will break out, and we must seize the opportunity and be well prepared for war. But compared to the global war caused by the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, the greatest threat to Chinese security is still the Soviet Union's invasion of China. Because the heart of the Soviet Union's desire to destroy us is not dead, it is our main and most dangerous enemy. In this regard, we must be sufficiently aware and cautious, focus on its aggression towards us, be prepared for an early and large-scale fight, conduct surprise attacks, be prepared to face the most serious situation, and never harbor any lucky mentality. The older comrades present here must be prepared to fight another major war in their lifetime. This understanding, to a certain extent, represents the views of Chinese leaders at that time. This understanding indicates that at that time, there was still a strong sense of crisis regarding the inevitability and imminent nature of war, especially the Soviet Union's invasion of China war.
Although it was believed that a global war and the Soviet Union's invasion of China were inevitable and imminent, Chinese leaders still sought to postpone the war, buy time, and focus on construction and strengthening national defense capabilities. Moreover, there were certain favorable conditions for delaying the outbreak of war: Mao Zedong's theory and revolutionary diplomatic strategy of dividing the world into three parts could help establish an international united front against hegemony. In addition, the Soviet Union's global strategy was not fully prepared, and after the United States' failure in Southeast Asia, their global strategy was defensive, and they were not fully prepared for a world war. Therefore, it was possible to gain some time and delay the outbreak of war. However, due to the grave estimation of the danger of war, it was still difficult to determine how much time could be gained to delay the outbreak of war. It was highly possible to gain five years or a little more time without engaging in war, but it might also be only two, three, or four years. In any case, it was necessary to prepare well in advance for all aspects of military preparedness. Before the outbreak of war, it was crucial to utilize the possible peace time to rapidly establish our country's strong economic and defense capabilities. Low speed was not acceptable, medium speed was not acceptable, it had to be high speed.
By early 1980, the basic estimation of the international situation mentioned above remained unchanged. China still believed that various contradictions in the world would continue to develop, the international situation would become more turbulent, and war factors would continually increase. However, considering the international political reality that war had not yet broken out and the domestic political reality that China was not fully prepared for war, Chinese leaders still hoped to postpone the arrival of war as much as possible. Deng Xiaoping proposed, "It is possible for us to gain some more time without engaging in war," and "we can delay the outbreak of war." "It is advantageous for us to gain a relatively long period of time for the modernization of our army, the improvement of our military combat capabilities, and our war preparedness work." At this time, while insisting that a large-scale global war was inevitable, there seemed to be a gradual easing of the highly urgent sense of an impending world war.
However, afterwards, the Chinese leaders' views on war and peace gradually began to adjust in response to the development and changes in the international situation. On January 16, 1980, Deng Xiaoping stated at the Central Committee Cadre Meeting of the Communist Party of China: 
"We have confidence that if the struggle against hegemony is done well, it is possible to delay the outbreak of war and strive for a longer period of peace." He also proposed the view that through the struggle against hegemony, the strategic deployment of the United States and the Soviet Union could be disrupted to delay the outbreak of war. Deng Xiaoping further eased his sense of crisis about the imminent war and strengthened his confidence in striving for a longer period of peace. Due to a more moderated judgment of the danger of war, Deng Xiaoping extended the previously proposed time for delaying war and seeking peace from five years or less to ten years or even twenty years. In April 1980, during his meeting with the President of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, Deng Xiaoping said: It seems that there will be some storms in the international arena, but taking a longer-term perspective and adopting effective measures, the dangers of the 1980s can be overcome, and it is possible to strive for a peaceful environment for twenty years. We need a relatively long-term peaceful environment for development. Although the international situation was unstable at that time, especially after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan at the end of 1979, the international situation became even more turbulent. However, Deng Xiaoping continuously extended the obtainable peace time, which shows a significant and fundamental change in his views on the world situation as well as war and peace. He shifted his focus from emphasizing the danger of war to stressing the importance of obtaining more extended periods of peace, and he emphasized the need to seize this peaceful time to develop the economy instead of preparing for war.
(2) A new summary of the world era theme. As China's relations with several major powers underwent significant changes, the Chinese side quickly noticed the positive role of these changes.
At the end of the 1970s, the international situation was still volatile, and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan at the end of 1979. In response to this international situation, the focal point of China's foreign relations was to "strive for more time without war," to "delay the outbreak of war," and to "seize time for development."
After establishing diplomatic relations with the United States, China initially strengthened the "One Line" strategy of cooperating with the United States against the Soviet Union. This was done both out of considerations for national security and the need to accelerate foreign opening-up. However, the normal development of China-US relations always encountered obstacles, with the Taiwan issue being the most significant. Shortly after establishing diplomatic relations with the United States, the US Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act," causing damage to China-US relations. On August 17, 1982, the governments of China and the United States issued a joint communiqué, stipulating step-by-step resolutions to the problem of US arms sales to Taiwan, which led to a basic stabilization of China-US relations. However, the US government did not fulfill its promises. In this situation, China began to widen the distance between itself and the United States.
In 1982, based on the need to strive for peace, delay war, and establish more balanced external relations, the Chinese government began to promote opposing hegemonism, safeguarding world peace, and strengthening solidarity and cooperation with the Third World as the basic principles of its new diplomatic policy. Regarding the implementation of this policy, Deng Xiaoping emphasized, "When we propose to safeguard world peace, it's not just empty talk. It is based on our own needs and also meets the needs of the world's people, especially the people of the Third World. Therefore, opposing hegemonism and safeguarding world peace are our genuine policies and the guidelines for our foreign policy." In September of the same year, Hu Yaobang stated in his report at the 12th National Congress, "China adheres to an independent foreign policy and develops relations with other countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."
In the mid-1980s, the international situation clearly began to ease. Not only did US-Soviet relations improve, but Sino-Soviet relations also became more relaxed. In light of these new changes in the international situation, in May 1984, Deng Xiaoping explicitly stated that the "peace issue" and the "North-South issue" had become two prominent issues in the world. On March 4, 1985, during a meeting with Japanese guests, he further concluded that "peace and development are the two major issues facing the contemporary world." He said, "The truly significant global strategic issues in the world today are peace and economic development or development issues. The peace problem is an East-West issue, and the development problem is a North-South issue. To sum it up, it's about the four directions: East, West, North, and South." The proposal of the theme of peace and development has laid an important foundation for the transformation of China's diplomatic strategy in the new era.
(3) Reestablishing an independent foreign policy. On September 1, 1982, Deng Xiaoping solemnly announced in the opening speech of the 12th National Congress: Independence, self-reliance, whether in the past, present, or future, are our footholds. The Chinese people cherish their friendship and cooperation with other countries and peoples, and cherish the right to independence and self-determination that they have gained through long-term struggles. No foreign country should expect China to be its vassal, nor should it expect China to suffer from actions that harm our interests.
It is obvious that Deng Xiaoping's remarks are aimed at the changes in Sino-US relations in the previous period, indicating the Chinese government's firm position and announcing the transformation of China's diplomatic strategy.
Deng Xiaoping also pointed out in his speech: Accelerating socialist modernization, striving to achieve reunification of the motherland, including Taiwan, opposing hegemonism, and maintaining world peace are the three major tasks for the Chinese people in the 1980s. Among these three major tasks, the core is economic construction, which is the foundation for solving international and domestic problems.
Deng Xiaoping's speech clearly indicated that the goal of China's diplomatic strategy is to create a favorable international environment for China's domestic socialist modernization, reflecting the guiding principle of diplomatic work serving the center of economic construction.
Hu Yaobang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, comprehensively expounded the issue of China's adherence to independent foreign policy in the political report of the 12th National Congress. He declared: "China will never attach itself to any big country or bloc of countries, nor will it yield to the pressure of any big country." "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are applicable to our relations with all countries, including socialist countries."
Independence and peaceful coexistence have been the diplomatic policies pursued by the People's Republic of China since its establishment. However, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, due to the limitations of the international environment and historical conditions at that time, there were tendencies to "align with the United States" and "align with the Soviet Union" in the strategy of "leaning to one side" and "drawing a line", which to some extent affected the implementation of independent foreign policy and peaceful coexistence in diplomatic work, and also affected China's relations with some countries friendly to the United States or the Soviet Union.
After entering the 1980s, based on China's long-standing diplomatic practice and the new changes in the international situation, Deng Xiaoping added new connotations to the diplomatic policy of independence and peaceful coexistence. The new connotation of independence and self-reliance is "non-alignment", not attaching itself to any big country or bloc of countries; the new connotation of the principle of peaceful coexistence is that the relations between countries should not be judged based on differences or similarities in social systems and ideologies; regardless of differences in social systems and ideologies, they should be established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Deng Xiaoping believed that dividing lines and determining closeness or distance based on social systems or ideologies are unreliable. Only by going beyond the differences in social systems and ideologies and universally implementing the five principles of peaceful coexistence can normal state-to-state relations be developed, international cooperation be enhanced, and world peace be maintained. China's adherence to an independent foreign policy of non-alignment and the universal implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence have received widespread praise and support internationally.
China regards the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of human progress and development as the fundamental goals of its diplomatic work, and to achieve world peace, it is first necessary to stop the arms race and implement genuine disarmament. To this end, the Chinese government has changed some of its views and practices on disarmament in the past, actively participated in various international disarmament activities, and put forward many new proposals and propositions on this issue. For example, it proposed that the goal of disarmament should be the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons; the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, should take the lead in stopping the testing, production, and deployment of all types of nuclear weapons and substantially reduce their various types of nuclear weapons in their domestic and foreign territories.
In order to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war, the Chinese government has also proposed that all nuclear states should undertake the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances, especially not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries and non-nuclear regions. On this basis, an international convention should be concluded with the participation of all nuclear states to ensure the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. Concurrently with nuclear disarmament, significant reductions in conventional arms should also be carried out. No country should develop, test, or deploy weapons in outer space in any way. An international convention banning and completely destroying chemical weapons should be concluded at an early date. To ensure the implementation of disarmament, disarmament agreements must include necessary and effective verification measures.
Considering that disarmament issues are related to the security interests of all countries in the world, the Chinese government has also proposed that disarmament issues should not be monopolized and dominated by a few major countries, and their disarmament agreements should not harm the interests of other countries. Regardless of the size or military strength of a country, all countries should have the equal right to participate in the discussion and resolution of disarmament issues, and achieve effective disarmament based on the principles of fairness, reasonableness, comprehensiveness, and balance.
In addition to proposing the above fair and reasonable suggestions, the Chinese government has also taken a series of practical actions on disarmament issues. For example, in 1985, the Chinese government reduced military personnel by 1 million and converted military production to civilian production, and converted a large number of military facilities for civilian or dual-use purposes. At the same time, defense spending was significantly reduced, and by the early 1990s, China's military expenditure as a proportion of GDP was the lowest among all countries. China's reasonable propositions and practical actions to reduce military armaments have gained universal welcome and praise from the international community.
Deng Xiaoping's international strategic thinking and diplomatic theories proposed in the new era, as well as the adjustments made by the Chinese government to its diplomatic principles and policies, have made China's independent and peaceful diplomacy more perfect, created a new situation in China's diplomatic work, and thereby played an important role in China's socialist modernization construction, safeguarding world peace, developing friendly cooperation with other countries, and promoting common prosperity, making great contributions.
2. Development of peaceful and friendly relations with major countries
As the leaders of China are undergoing changes regarding war and peace issues, China's relations with several major countries are also changing.
(1) The good development of Sino-Japanese relations. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan in October 1978, the relations between the two countries began to develop well in politics, economy, science and technology, culture, and other fields. In December 1979, Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira of Japan officially visited China. During this visit, both sides believed that, although China and Japan have different systems, it is necessary to further strengthen intergovernmental dialogue and promote exchanges at various levels between the two countries in order to deepen mutual understanding and trust. During this visit, the leaders of both countries focused on discussing China-Japan economic cooperation issues. The leaders of the two countries unanimously agreed that further cooperation between China and Japan in the fields of resources and energy is desirable, and agreements were reached on cooperation in exploring and developing oil in Bohai Sea, as well as cooperating in the development of coal resources, etc. The Japanese side also stated that from 1979 to 1983, Japan would provide 330 billion yen (about 1.5 billion US dollars) in economic cooperation funds loans to China for priority construction projects, including two ports (Qinhuangdao Port and Shijiusuo Port) and two railways (Jingqin Railway and Yanshi Railway), and from April 1980, preferential tariff treatment would be provided to Chinese products. During Prime Minister Ohira's visit, the two sides also signed a cultural exchange agreement. Through Prime Minister Ohira's visit, economic cooperation between China and Japan was significantly advanced.
1982 marked the 10th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki conducted reciprocal visits. At the end of May and the beginning of June 1982, during Zhao Ziyang's visit to Japan, he proposed three principles for the development of Sino-Japanese relations: based on the "Sino-Japanese Joint Statement" and the "Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship", actively develop the economic relationship between the two countries on the basis of the existing peaceful and friendly relationship; Sino-Japanese economic relations should follow the principles of equality, mutual benefit, complementarity, and continuously develop towards new breadth and depth based on their respective needs and capacities; the development of this economic relationship is in line with the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Japanese peoples and their desire for everlasting friendship, and should be long-term, stable, and not affected by international vicissitudes. The three principles for Sino-Japanese relations proposed by China received positive responses from Prime Minister Suzuki and the Japanese government. In September of the same year, Prime Minister Suzuki returned to China. Deng Xiaoping told Prime Minister Suzuki that in summary, Sino-Japanese relations means that the peoples of the two countries will be friends for generations, which is our national policy.
In November 1983, General Secretary Hu Yaobang visited Japan. Prime Minister Nakasone proposed to change the three principles of Sino-Japanese relations to four principles, adding "mutual trust" in addition to the existing three principles of "peace, friendship, equality, mutual benefit, long-term stability". Hu Yaobang agreed. In accordance with the agreed upon during this visit, the "China-Japan Friendship Committee for the 21st Century" was established in 1984 with representatives from various sectors of China and Japan, and 3,000 Japanese young people visited China in the same year. The following year, 500 Chinese young people visited Japan.
In March 1984, Prime Minister Nakasone visited China. In April 1985, Chairman Peng Zhen visited Japan. The above visits by leaders of the two countries made positive contributions to the establishment of the four principles of Sino-Japanese relations and the promotion of long-term and stable friendly cooperation between China and Japan. During this period, exchanges and cooperation between China and Japan in the fields of economy, culture, science and technology were more active. By 1989, the total trade volume between China and Japan reached 18.9 billion US dollars, 2.7 times the total trade volume of 1979; Japan became China's second largest trading partner, ahead of the United States. Progress was made in financial cooperation and technology transfer between the two countries. In December 1979, when Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki visited China, the Japanese government officially announced its financial cooperation for the six large-scale projects proposed by China, deciding to provide the first batch of 50 billion yuan in government loans to China in 1979, with an annual interest rate of 3%, a repayment period of 30 years, and a 10-year grace period. This was referred to as government development aid, abbreviated as ODA. In 1984, the second batch of low-interest loans amounted to 470 billion yen (about 2.1 billion US dollars). In December 1984, the Japanese side agreed to provide the second batch of energy development loans to the Chinese side for about 2.4 billion US dollars. In 1988, the Japanese side proposed the third batch of low-interest loans amounting to 810 billion yen, mainly for the construction of 42 key projects during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period. New progress was also made in Sino-Japanese cooperation in the development of offshore oil fields, with five contracts signed and a total investment of 800 million US dollars from the Japanese side. In order to promote and guarantee the smooth development of economic cooperation between the two countries, the two governments signed the Sino-Japanese Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement in 1983. The increasingly close economic cooperation between China and Japan has effectively promoted the development of their respective economies and brought great benefits to both parties.
Of course, while China and Japan have achieved good development in their bilateral relations, some problems have also occurred. For example, in 1979 and 1980, the Japanese side infringed on China's sovereignty in the Diaoyu Islands issue; in the spring of 1982, the "textbook incident" occurred. At that time, the Japanese Ministry of Education tampered with the history of Japan's militarist aggression against China when approving history textbooks for primary and secondary schools, changing "invasion" to "entry", changing "comprehensive invasion" by Japan into "comprehensive attack", and even stating that the cause of the "Nanjing Massacre" was "due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, the enraged Japanese army killed many Chinese soldiers and civilians," etc., absolving Japan of any guilt. In 1985, the Prime Minister of Japan and other government members formally paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines war criminals, and so on. Although these events have to some extent affected the smooth development of Sino-Japanese relations, overall, the development of relations between the two countries during this period was relatively good.
(2) Sino-US relations continue to progress in promoting understanding. China and the United States officially established diplomatic relations in 1979. In order to further strengthen mutual understanding between China and the US and promote the development of Sino-US relations, Deng Xiaoping accepted President Carter's invitation to make an official friendly visit to the United States in early 1979. This was the first visit by a Chinese leader to the US after the establishment of the People's Republic of China and received a warm welcome from the US government and people. During the visit, Deng Xiaoping exchanged views with President Carter on the international situation, especially the issue of Vietnam invading Cambodia with the support of the Soviet Union. The two sides also discussed Taiwan-related issues and Sino-US relations. During the visit, China and the US signed agreements on scientific and technological cooperation, cultural cooperation, cooperation in education, business, and space, as well as agreements to establish consular relations, mutually set up consulates general, and decided to hold negotiations on trade, aviation, and maritime agreements. During the visit, Deng Xiaoping had extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in the United States.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US and Deng Xiaoping's visit to the US promoted the development of Sino-US relations in various fields. In August 1980, China and the US signed agreements on civil aviation, maritime, and textile, which significantly increased bilateral trade and facilitated rapid cultural exchanges. However, some misguided actions by the United States on the Taiwan issue continue to be a major obstacle to the smooth development of Sino-US relations.
After the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US, President Carter proposed a "legislative adjustment" bill to Congress regarding US-Taiwan relations on January 26, 1979, stating that in the future, commercial, cultural, and other relations with Taiwan will be maintained on an unofficial basis and an "American Institute in Taiwan" will be established to handle relevant affairs. When discussing this bill, both Houses of the US Congress proposed a series of amendments that severely violated the principles of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the US and blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs. This strongly provoked opposition from the Chinese side.
At the end of March 1979, the US Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act," which violated the fundamental principles of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the US and recognized international law in terms of its basic spirit and many specific provisions. This was particularly evident in the so-called "guaranteeing Taiwan's security" issue and the nature of US-Taiwan relations. The "Taiwan Relations Act" declared, "The President shall inform the Congress promptly of any threat to the security or social and economic system of the people on Taiwan and any danger to the interests of the United States arising therefrom and determine the appropriate action to be taken in accordance with the constitutional processes by the United States and the Congress." These provisions actually reinstated the US-Taiwan "Mutual Defense Treaty," which was announced to be terminated in the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the US, and blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs.
The "Taiwan Relations Act" also legally stipulated that the US would continue providing so-called "defense articles" and "defense services" to Taiwan. The law stated that the recognition of the People's Republic of China should not in any way affect the various tangible or intangible properties that the Taiwan authorities possessed in the United States before the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. According to international law, after the US recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government of China, the US had an obligation to promptly hand over the official properties of China that were previously occupied by the Taiwan authorities to the People's Republic of China. Many provisions in the "Taiwan Relations Act" actually treated Taiwan as an independent political entity and attempted to give the US-Taiwan relationship an official nature.
On April 10, Carter signed the "Taiwan Relations Act," with reservations only on specific issues, indicating that he would exercise the "consideration power" granted by the law in a manner consistent with the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. China is furious about the emergence of the "Taiwan Relations Act". On April 19th, Deng Xiaoping, when meeting with the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee delegation visiting China, pointed out that the political foundation of Sino-US normalization is the recognition of one China. Now this foundation has been disrupted; China is dissatisfied with the "Taiwan Relations Act" passed by the US Congress. The fundamental problem of this bill is that it does not actually recognize the existence of one China. On April 28th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the US Embassy in China, pointing out that the "Taiwan Relations Act" essentially intentionally continues to treat Taiwan as a "country" and the Taiwan authorities as a "government", and many of its clauses violate the principles of the China-US Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations. The US Embassy in China responded on July 6th, saying, "The United States will abide by the understandings reached with the People's Republic of China regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations", and "the final version of the Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress does not fully reflect the government's intentions in every detail, but it provides the President with sufficient discretionary power to allow the President to carry out this law in a manner consistent with normalization." However, the US Congress eventually passed this bill.
Following the "Taiwan Relations Act" incident, the United States increased arms sales to Taiwan. After long-term negotiations between China and the United States, the "817" Communiqué was reached in 1982, which further clarified the principles and directions for resolving the issue of arms sales to Taiwan. This took an important step in removing obstacles in China-US relations.
To enhance mutual understanding between China and the United States, stabilize bilateral relations, promote China-US friendship, and maintain world peace, in January 1984, Premier Zhao Ziyang of the State Council visited the United States at the invitation of President Reagan and exchanged views with President Reagan and other leaders of the US government on international situations and major international issues of mutual interest. In April of the same year, President Reagan paid a return visit to Chinese leaders. In July 1985, Chairman Li Xiannian visited the United States, followed by Vice President Bush's visit to China in October of the same year. The visits of leaders of the two countries continued to exchange views on bilateral relations and major international issues, with the Taiwan issue being one of the core issues. Obviously, only by removing the obstacle of the Taiwan issue can a truly reliable foundation be established for the stable and lasting development of China-US relations.
Although there have always been obstacles between China and the United States on the Taiwan issue, the overall trend of development in economic, trade, scientific, technological exchanges, and cooperation between the two countries is positive. Economic and technological cooperation between China and the United States has gradually developed. By the end of 1986, the total amount of direct investment contracts by the United States in China exceeded 2.627 billion US dollars. Among them, joint ventures invested 400 million US dollars, and investment in offshore oil development was nearly 600 million US dollars. There were a total of 62 approved Sino-US joint ventures, accounting for 6% of the total number of Chinese foreign-funded joint ventures, second only to the Hong Kong region, ranking first among all countries. From 1979 to 1986, the Chinese and US governments signed 27 official agreements on scientific and technological cooperation, with more than 500 cooperative projects and over 5,000 personnel exchanges.
Bilateral trade between the two countries, which was almost zero in 1972, reached 3.53 billion US dollars by 1985, making the United States China's third-largest trading partner. From 1981 to 1986, the cumulative bilateral trade volume exceeded 35.3 billion US dollars. Among them, 5.9 billion dollars in 1981; 5.28 billion dollars in 1982; it dropped to 4 billion dollars in 1983, but rebounded to 6.1 billion dollars in 1984; reached 7.4 billion dollars in 1985; and 7.3 billion dollars in 1986.
During the visit to China by US Secretary of Commerce Baldrige in May 1983, he announced to the Chinese government the Reagan administration's new regulations to relax technology exports to China, changing China from a "P" group country subject to US export controls to a "V" group country, placing China in the same category as friendly non-aligned countries. This regulation was officially announced by the United States on June 21st of the same year. In October 1985, the United States opened up the export of 27 different categories of equipment to China. US technology exports to China have loosened to some extent.
However, there are also many problems in economic trade and technological cooperation between China and the United States. The trade protectionism within the United States has posed a threat to the development of Sino-US economic and trade relations. For example, the United States has repeatedly restricted the import of Chinese textiles. From 1972 to 1986, China's trade deficit with the United States amounted to a cumulative $18.4 billion. The Sino-US investment protection agreement has also failed to reach a result after several years of negotiations due to the United States' insistence on more stringent conditions compared to other developed countries. In terms of technology transfer, the United States still imposes many restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China, which requires approval from the United States' national security review and the "Paris Coordinating Committee".
(3) The Sino-Soviet relationship developed during the process of "thawing". Starting from the 1960s, Soviet leaders seriously violated the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, leading to a serious deterioration of relations between the two countries. In the late 1970s, the Soviet Union continued to maintain and strengthen its military pressure on China's northern border, posing a serious threat to China's security. This made the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in name only. In view of this, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made a decision on April 3, 1979, not to extend the treaty after its expiration. On the same day, Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua met with Soviet Ambassador to China Xie Erbakov and handed him a Note from the Chinese government to the Soviet government, informing the Soviet side of the above decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
In 1982, progress was made in the talks between China and the United States on the issue of selling weapons to Taiwan, which led to a new improvement in Sino-US relations and had a positive impact on Sino-Soviet relations. On March 24, Soviet leader Brezhnev delivered a speech in Tashkent expressing a willingness to improve relations with China. Deng Xiaoping took note of the information conveyed by the Soviet side and immediately instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to respond to it. On March 26, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference and issued a brief statement on Sino-Soviet relations. The next day, the People's Daily published this statement prominently on its front page, causing widespread international repercussions. In the summer, Deng Xiaoping invited several leaders from the Central Committee and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a meeting and proposed to take a major action to send a message to the Soviet Union and strive for a major improvement in Sino-Soviet relations. But this had principles and conditions, and the condition was that the Soviet Union had to do something, so it was proposed that the Soviet Union take the initiative to resolve the "three major obstacles". Subsequently, senior officials from the foreign ministries of both China and the Soviet Union visited the other country as embassy guests to conduct work visits. On August 10, the head of the Soviet European Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited Moscow in the name of inspecting embassy work and proposed to hold political consultations at the level of deputy foreign ministers. On the 20th, the Soviet side presented a memorandum as a formal reply, agreeing to discuss bilateral relationship issues with the Chinese side at any time, any place, and any level, in order to "eliminate obstacles to the normalization of relations". In view of the positive response from the Soviet side, Deng Xiaoping decided to reopen the Sino-Soviet negotiations after listening to the report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thereafter, the two sides agreed to establish an official dialogue channel and hold political consultations at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Beijing and Moscow alternately, to discuss how to achieve the normalization of relations between the two countries. In September, Hu Yaobang mentioned in his report at the 12th National Party Congress that as long as the Soviet Union took practical steps to remove the security threat to China, Sino-Soviet relations could move towards normalization. Regardless of the state of Sino-Soviet relations, China will uphold and develop the friendship between the two peoples. This expressed a positive response to speeches by Soviet leaders regarding policies towards China. In October, the two countries resumed political dialogue and held the first round of deputy foreign minister-level consultations. China proposed the elimination of three major obstacles, namely withdrawing troops from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border, withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, and urging Vietnam to cease aggression against Cambodia and withdraw its troops from Cambodia. This is the key to achieving the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union used the excuse of not harming the "interests of third countries" to adopt an attitude of non-recognition and refusal to discuss the "three major obstacles." 
Subsequently, when several Soviet leaders passed away, China sent delegations to the Soviet Union to attend funerals, led by members of the Central Political Bureau, the Foreign Minister, and the Secretary of the Central Secretariat and Vice Premier respectively. Through high-level contacts, they affirmed the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, expressed a desire to improve Sino-Soviet relations, and urged the Soviet side to take practical actions to normalize Sino-Soviet relations. In December 1984, Deputy Prime Minister Aksyuchits visited China. Bilateral contacts were raised from vice-ministerial to vice-premier level, and the Economic, Trade, and Technological Committee was established. An economic and technical cooperation agreement was signed for industrial projects in China and their reconstruction, as well as a barter and payment agreement from 1986 to 1990. Bilateral trade increased, border trade resumed, and cooperation expanded, significantly improving bilateral relations.
In March 1985, Gorbachev assumed the position of General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. In October 1985, Deng Xiaoping asked the leader of Romania, who was visiting China, to deliver a message to Gorbachev: if the Soviet Union could persuade Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia, he would be willing to meet with Gorbachev. In November, the Soviet side proposed that the time was ripe for the highest-level meeting between the Soviet Union and China and the restoration of relations between the two parties and countries, suggesting that the meeting be held in the Soviet Far East or within Chinese territory to discuss the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. In July 1986, Gorbachev made a speech in Vladivostok, stating that the Soviet Union would withdraw six divisions from Afghanistan by the end of 1986, discussing the withdrawal of a "considerable number of Soviet troops" from Mongolia, and expressing willingness to demarcate the border on the main channel of the Sino-Soviet boundary river. He also said, "The Soviet Union is willing to seriously discuss supplementary measures to establish a good-neighborly situation with China at any time and at any level." China cautiously welcomed this and made a positive gesture, agreeing to resume border negotiations. In September, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that if the Soviet Union took solid steps to eliminate the three major obstacles in Sino-Soviet relations, especially in urging Vietnam to stop aggression in Cambodia and withdraw its troops, he would be willing to meet with Gorbachev anywhere in the Soviet Union.
Due to the improvement in bilateral relations, Sino-Soviet border negotiations officially resumed in February 1987. After two rounds of negotiations, progress was finally made after years of stalemate. From August 27th to September 1st, 1988, Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev held working discussions in Beijing specifically on the issue of Cambodia. The two sides reached a certain level of internal understanding. On September 16th, Gorbachev made a speech in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, proposing that the Soviet Union was ready to start preparations for the highest-level meeting between the Soviet Union and China. Based on the working discussions between the vice foreign ministers of China and the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's speech on September 16th, a meeting was held on September 28th in New York between Qian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister attending the 43rd United Nations General Assembly, and Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister. Both sides believed that the discussion of the Cambodian issue should continue. From December 1st to 3rd, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made an official visit to the Soviet Union at the invitation. This was the first official visit by a Chinese Foreign Minister to the Soviet Union since 1957, with the main task of preparing for a Sino-Soviet summit. From February 1st to 4th, 1989, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze made a return visit to China, also in preparation for the Sino-Soviet summit. On February 6th, both sides issued statements regarding the Cambodian issue and Gorbachev's visit to China. The statements indicated that "both sides advocate for an early and fair political solution to the Cambodian issue and express their willingness to make efforts to promote the realization of this goal"; "both sides believe that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia is an important part of the political solution to the Cambodian issue." Both parties note Vietnam's decision to withdraw all troops from Cambodia by the end of September 1989 at the latest, and hope that the implementation of this decision will promote progress in other aspects of resolving the Cambodian issue. Both parties also agree to continue discussions on resolving the Cambodian issue. As a result, one of the most important obstacles, namely the Cambodian issue, has essentially been resolved.
Of the "three major obstacles," the other two obstacles were relatively easily resolved. Regarding the issue of reducing Soviet troops stationed along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders, the Soviet Union announced in January 1987 that it would withdraw a motorized infantry division and other parts of its troops from Mongolia in the next 4 to 6 months. In December 1988, Gorbachev announced in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly that the Soviet Union would withdraw 75% of its troops from Mongolia within two years. On May 15, 1989, this withdrawal process began. Regarding the issue of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, in July 1986, Gorbachev announced in a speech in Vladivostok that the Soviet Union, after withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, would hold negotiations with Pakistan, the Kabul government of Afghanistan, and the United States under the auspices of the United Nations. On April 14, 1988, the four parties signed an agreement in Geneva on the political resolution of the Afghan issue, which stipulated that the Soviet Union would begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan on May 15, 1988, and complete the withdrawal within 9 months. Finally, the Soviet Army completely withdrew from Afghanistan by February 15, 1989. With this, the "three major obstacles" that impacted the relations between the two countries were essentially resolved, and the path to the Sino-Soviet summit was finally cleared.
From May 15 to 18, 1989, at the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, made an official visit to China. During this visit, Gorbachev held meetings separately with Chairman Yang Shangkun, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Zhao Ziyang, and Premier of the State Council Li Peng, among other Chinese leaders. However, the most crucial meeting was the high-level meeting with Deng Xiaoping on the morning of May 16.
Prior to the meeting, Deng Xiaoping first clarified that the theme of the meeting was "ending the past and opening up the future," while emphasizing that "the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." Based on this, Deng Xiaoping set the policy for the meeting: not to evade differences, not to dwell on old accounts, to seek common ground, focus on the future, and explore the establishment of a new type of friendly neighborly relationship on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Through this high-level meeting, the two neighboring countries, China and the Soviet Union, finally ended decades of abnormal state and reestablished normal state-to-state relations. On the evening of the 16th, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Zhao Ziyang met with Gorbachev, signifying the normalization of relations between the two parties.
On May 18, the joint communique between China and the Soviet Union was issued in Beijing, summarizing the consensus reached during the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union. The communique officially confirmed the guidelines for bilateral relations agreed upon by the top leaders of the two countries. It is different from the alliance relationship of the 1950s and the confrontational state of the 1960s and 1970s. It is a normal state-to-state relationship of non-alignment, non-confrontation, non-targeting of third countries, and friendly neighborliness.
3. Development and expansion of neighborhood diplomacy and multilateral diplomacy
After entering the 1980s, with the adjustment of China's diplomatic strategy, in addition to focusing on advancing major country diplomacy, China also vigorously developed neighborhood and multilateral diplomacy, achieving positive results. From 1983 to 1987, China established diplomatic relations with 10 more countries, bringing the total number of diplomatic relations to 135. The Chinese government and the country's top leaders made friendly visits to 46 countries, and vice-premiers, government envoys, and foreign ministers visited 77 countries. China hosted visits from heads of state, heads of government, vice presidents, vice premiers, and foreign ministers from more than 90 countries. Chinese and foreign senior parliamentary leaders visited each other 113 times. China has participated in 64 international conventions, signed 12 bilateral consular treaties, and many other operational agreements, laying a foundation for friendly cooperation between China and countries around the world.
Of particular note is the significant improvement in China's relations with neighboring countries. From 1984 to 1987, China's leaders visited Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Nepal. Trade and friendly exchanges between China and Mongolia increased, and the two countries signed a new consular treaty. China negotiated the normalization of relations with Laos and the two countries resumed the exchange of ambassadors. China's relations with Indonesia improved through multiple contacts, and both sides resumed direct trade.
Overall, China's foreign relations have developed well with clear results:
First, in terms of relations with neighboring countries. China attaches importance to properly handling historical issues with neighboring countries and has made certain adjustments to its policies towards Southeast Asian countries, distinguishing strictly between party-to-party relations and state relations, which greatly improved bilateral relations between China and Southeast Asian countries. At the same time, China proposed the Five Principles for resolving the China-India border issue, leading to the resumption of high-level visits and border negotiations between the two countries.
Second, in terms of relations with developing countries. China emphasizes practical cooperation and has put forward the four principles of "equality, mutual benefit, practical results, and diversified forms" for economic cooperation, which has deepened China's economic foundation with developing countries.
Third, in terms of relations with Western European countries. By the late 1970s, China had established diplomatic relations with all Western European countries except Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the Vatican. China also proposed specific ways to accelerate economic cooperation with Western European countries, such as joint ventures, cooperative development, compensatory trade, processing of supplied materials, and processing of samples, particularly through the joint development of oil, coal, and non-ferrous metal resources. In the 1970s and early 1980s, China signed cooperation agreements with many Western European countries in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology, culture, civil aviation, and maritime transportation. In 1978 and 1979, China also signed trade and textile agreements with the European Community. From 1980 onwards, China received most favored nation treatment from the European Community. During this period, there was a significant increase in China's trade with Western Europe, as well as a promising start in other forms of economic cooperation. China imported some advanced technologies from Western European countries and began to attract funds needed for modernization from them. The common desire for "development in peace" laid a solid foundation and opened up broad prospects for China's relations with Western European countries.
After 1983, China's trade with Western European countries continued to grow. The trade volume reached 9.575 billion US dollars in 1985, an increase of 40.7% compared to 1984. In 1986, the trade volume reached 11.339 billion US dollars, an increase of 39.3% compared to 1985. However, China's trade deficit was relatively large.
Fourth, in international organizations, China actively participates in multilateral diplomatic activities centered around the United Nations, utilizing its international position as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. China has joined 64 international conventions and played an important role in promoting world peace and development. In terms of development promotion, China emphasizes that it is a member of developing countries and strives to strengthen its relations with them. China actively contributes to promoting North-South dialogue, South-South cooperation, and international economic and technological cooperation. In the government work report at the Fourth Session of the Sixth National People's Congress in March 1986, Zhao Ziyang clearly stated that multilateral diplomacy is an important part of China's independent and peaceful foreign policy:
"China adheres to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, supports the work carried out by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in accordance with the spirit of the Charter, and actively participates in activities favorable to world peace and development conducted by the United Nations and its specialized agencies. China actively participates in various international organizations and engages in active multilateral diplomatic activities, striving to enhance cooperation among countries in various fields. By the end of 1986, China had entered almost all important areas of intergovernmental multilateral diplomacy, participating in nearly 400 international organizations and approving accession to 13 international conventions. China has established 11 permanent multilateral diplomatic institutions in various countries, as well as 10 representative offices of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in China. In 1984, Chinese renowned jurist Ni Zhenghuan was elected as a judge of the International Court of Justice at the 39th session of the United Nations General Assembly, bringing an end to the historical absence of Chinese nationals serving in this important institution. In November 1986, Chinese jurists were again elected as members of the International Law Commission.
In the aspect of multilateral economic and technical assistance, China actively participates and strives to promote cooperation in all aspects. By the end of 1986, China had signed and implemented loan agreements with the World Bank totaling 4.15 billion US dollars, of which 1.6 billion US dollars were concessional loans, accounting for 39%. There were 41 loan projects mainly used for education, health, agriculture, transportation, hydroelectric power, energy, etc. China borrowed the first tranche of credit loans from the International Monetary Fund twice in 1981 and 1986, totaling 1.048 billion special drawing rights. In seven years, institutions such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, and the United Nations Children's Fund promised more than 800 million US dollars in free technical assistance to China and arranged approximately 600 projects. At the same time, China also made contributions to United Nations economic institutions, donating a total of 25.48 million yuan and 25.51 million US dollars in convertible currencies by the end of 1986. These contributions have played a positive role in promoting China's economic construction and strengthening international economic and technological cooperation.
In the past decade since the reform and opening-up, through a new round of adjustments to its foreign policy, China's diplomacy has begun to develop comprehensively. An international environment and surrounding environment favorable to our country's modernization construction and reform and opening-up has initially formed.
IV. Proposing the "One Country, Two Systems" concept and initiating the peaceful reunification process
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee with Deng Xiaoping at the core, based on the significant changes in domestic and international situations and from the perspective of the fundamental interests of the country and the nation, creatively put forward the scientific concept of "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems," ultimately making it a basic national policy of our country.
1. The genesis of the scientific concept of "one country, two systems" for peaceful reunification of the motherland
The policy of "one country, two systems" for the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the inheritance and development of the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards Taiwan since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's advance was unstoppable, and the goal of "overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the whole of China" quickly became a reality. Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in despair. Since then, the unfortunate separation of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait occurred. Mao Zedong and others, faced with the situation of the mainland and Taiwan being separated, have been tirelessly exploring and seeking ways and means to achieve the reunification of the motherland, proposing a series of policies towards Taiwan.
From 1949 to 1955, the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards Taiwan can be summarized as solving the problem through "relying solely on armed force." On December 31, 1949, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a "Letter to the Frontline Soldiers and Compatriots Nationwide," indicating that the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang had been permanently overthrown, and the task in 1950 was to liberate Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Tibet, completely destroying the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek group. By May 1950, except for Tibet, the mainland of China had been completely liberated, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with high morale, actively prepared for a cross-sea war to liberate Taiwan. However, not long after, the Korean War broke out, and the US Seventh Fleet invaded the Taiwan Strait, using force to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan. Subsequently, China sent volunteers to fight in Korea, temporarily suspending the action to liberate Taiwan. After the end of the Korean War, the Chinese government reiterated its policy of using force to solve the Taiwan issue on multiple occasions.
In 1955, our army conducted amphibious operations and liberated the islands of Yijiangshan and Dachen. In May 1955, the Communist Party of China had a new change in its policy towards Taiwan. On May 13th, Zhou Enlai first proposed two possible ways to liberate Taiwan during the 15th meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee: through war or through peaceful means. The Chinese people are willing to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan under possible conditions. This is not a joke, but a solemn promise approved by Mao Zedong. In April 1956, Mao Zedong put forward the policies of "peace is precious," "loving the country is a priority," and "loving the country regardless of order". On June 28th of the same year, Zhou Enlai conveyed a new message to the world during the third meeting of the first session of the National People's Congress: "Our government has repeatedly pointed out that there are two possible ways for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, through war or through peaceful means; the Chinese people are willing to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan under possible conditions. There is no doubt that if Taiwan can achieve peace, it will be most beneficial for our country, our Chinese people, and the peace of Asia and the world... Now, on behalf of the government, I officially state that we are willing to negotiate with the authorities in Taiwan on the specific steps and conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and we hope that the authorities in Taiwan will send representatives to Beijing or other appropriate locations to start such negotiations when they deem it appropriate."
At the same time, the CPC Central Committee also sent a message through Zhang Shizhao in Hong Kong to Chiang Kai-shek, stating "the tomb cottage in Fenghua is still standing, and the flowers and grass in Xikou are unharmed". It aimed to move Chiang Kai-shek with a sense of hometown sentiment. On July 16th, 1956, Zhou Enlai met Hong Kong journalist Cao Juren in Beijing. He was a mysterious figure with a special relationship with the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. During the meeting, Zhou Enlai said, "The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have cooperated twice. The first cooperation resulted in the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution, and the second cooperation resulted in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. These are all facts. Why can't there be a third cooperation? We are not surrendering to Taiwan, but we want to talk to each other. As long as the political power is unified, everything else can be discussed and arranged." 
Mao Zedong later personally met with Cao Juren, which shows the importance Mao Zedong attached to this matter. During the meeting, Mao Zedong said, "If Taiwan is unified with the mainland and lives according to their own way of life, even the fish in the water have regional specificity. Mao's fish won't survive in other places." Mao Zedong also stated that if Chiang Kai-shek is connected with the mainland and dissolves the alliance with the United States, the root will still be his own, so he can continue to survive and carry out his own system. His army can be preserved, I will not oppress him to reduce troops, I don't need him to simplify his government, and let him carry out the Three Principles of the People. Zhou Enlai summed up these ideas as "one principle, four goals," which means that Taiwan must be unified with the mainland (one principle); after Taiwan and the mainland are unified, except for diplomacy, all military and political powers and personnel arrangements will be decided by Chiang Kai-shek; the funding shortage for all military, political, and construction expenses will be allocated by the central government; social reforms in Taiwan can proceed gradually through negotiations; both sides should agree not to send people to disrupt each other's unity (four goals). In fact, it also includes the basic idea of "one country, two systems."
However, the Kuomintang did not respond positively to the Communist Party of China's peace initiative. On the contrary, it continued to increase troops in Kinmen and Matsu, while the United States intensified its activities behind the scenes, attempting to make the Kuomintang accept its scheme of "controlling the straits". In this situation, on the one hand, to strike against the reactionary atmosphere of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and on the other hand, to maintain the "connection" between the mainland, Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu in the form of armed conflict, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's frontline forces in Fujian were ordered to launch a fierce attack on the islands of Jinmen and Da Dan, Er Dan in August 1958, with "a simultaneous barrage of ten thousand cannons". However, despite this, the government of our country still adhered to its policy of primarily liberating by force and seeking peace as a supplement. During the period of the "Cultural Revolution," influenced by "leftist" ideology, our government adopted a tougher stance in its policy towards Taiwan, which was a phase of "continuing to maintain the military confrontation and engaging in diplomatic struggles."
2. Preliminary Ideas on the Policy of Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland in the New Era
In the late 1970s, due to the relatively relaxed international situation, China's diplomacy entered a new phase. China successively restored and established normal relations with the United States and Japan. The United States and Japan both recognized the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government of China and that Taiwan is part of China's territory. By 1978, the number of countries that had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China had increased to 116, while only 23 countries and regions maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
On New Year's Day of 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," which marked the comprehensive determination of the Chinese government's policy of peaceful reunification. The Communist Party of China stated in the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan": "Today, the realization of China's reunification is the common aspiration of the people and the overall trend. It is universally recognized that there is only one China and that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China. The recent signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and the normalization of relations between China and the United States are further evidence that nothing can stop the trend. At present, the motherland is stable and united, and the situation is better than ever before. The people of all ethnic groups on the mainland are working together to achieve the great goals of the four modernizations. We earnestly hope that Taiwan will return to the motherland as soon as possible and jointly develop the cause of building the country. Our national leaders have expressed their determination to consider the actual situation and accomplish the great cause of reunifying the motherland, respecting the status quo of Taiwan and the opinions of people from all walks of life in Taiwan, and adopting reasonable policies and measures so as not to cause any harm to the Taiwanese people."
"The Chinese government has ordered the People's Liberation Army to stop shelling islands such as Kinmen starting today. There is still military confrontation between both sides in the Taiwan Strait, which can only create artificial tension. We believe that the military confrontation should be ended through negotiations between the government of the People's Republic of China and the authorities in Taiwan in order to create the necessary conditions and a safe environment for any form of exchange between the two sides."
The "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" not only marked the comprehensive determination of the Chinese government's policy of peaceful reunification but also contained the germination of the idea of "one country, two systems." Shortly after the publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," during his visit to the United States, Deng Xiaoping explained China's policy toward Taiwan to relevant American figures, saying: "According to our wishes, we entirely hope to resolve this issue through peaceful means because it is more beneficial to the nation and the Chinese people. We no longer use the term 'liberate Taiwan' but as long as the reunification of the motherland is achieved, 'we will respect the reality and the existing system there.'" This was actually the first time that the idea of using the "one country, two systems" approach to resolve the Taiwan issue was publicly proposed.
On December 6 of the same year, during his meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, Deng Xiaoping further specified the idea of "one country, two systems." He said: "The conditions we have for Taiwan are very simple. That is, the system in Taiwan remains unchanged, the way of life remains unchanged, and the people-to-people relations between Taiwan and foreign countries remain unchanged, including foreign investments and people-to-people exchanges in Taiwan. Taiwan, as a local government, can have its own self-defense and military capabilities. There is only one condition, which is that Taiwan must be an integral part of China. As a local government of China, it has ample autonomy."
On September 30, 1981, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Ye Jianying, issued the Nine Guidelines for Peaceful Reunification of Taiwan, namely:
(1) In order to quickly end the unfortunate situation of national division for the Chinese nation, we suggest holding equal negotiations between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang, implementing a third cooperation, and jointly accomplishing the great cause of reunification. The two sides can first make contact and fully exchange opinions.
(2) The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait urgently hope for information exchange, family reunification, trade development, and increased understanding. We suggest that both sides jointly provide convenience for postal, trade, visiting relatives, tourism, as well as academic, cultural, and sports exchanges, and reach relevant agreements.
(3) After national reunification, Taiwan can become a special administrative region with a high degree of autonomy and retain its military. The central government will not interfere in the affairs of Taiwan.
(4) The current social and economic systems of Taiwan will remain unchanged, as well as the way of life and economic and cultural relations with foreign countries. Private property, houses, land, business ownership, legal inheritance rights, and foreign investments shall not be infringed upon.
(5) The authorities and representatives from all sectors in Taiwan can assume leadership positions in national political institutions and participate in national governance.
(6) When Taiwan's local finances encounter difficulties, the central government can provide appropriate subsidies.
(7) The people from all ethnic groups and various sectors in Taiwan who are willing to settle in the mainland of the motherland shall be properly arranged, free from discrimination, and enjoy freedom of coming and going.
(8) Taiwanese business and industrial figures are welcome to invest in the mainland of the motherland and establish various economic ventures, guaranteeing their legal rights and profits.
(9) It is the responsibility of every individual to reunify the motherland. We wholeheartedly welcome the people from all ethnic groups, various sectors, and mass organizations in Taiwan to provide suggestions and discuss national issues through various channels and in various ways.
Up to this point, the Communist Party of China has outlined the basic content of "one country, two systems" in practice.
3. Formal Proposal of "One Country, Two Systems"
In January 1982, Deng Xiaoping formally proposed the concept of "one country, two systems" for the first time in a conversation, pointing out that the nine principles proposed by Ye Jianying were in fact "one country, two systems". Afterwards, the leaders of the Party and the country made statements on "one country, two systems" on different occasions. In September of the same year, Deng Xiaoping stated during his meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the issue of recovering Hong Kong's sovereignty that the issue could be resolved with the "one country, two systems" approach. This indicates that the policy of using "one country, two systems" to solve the issue of national reunification has expanded from Taiwan to Hong Kong and Macau.
In December of the same year, in the amendment to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China passed at the fifth session of the Fifth National People's Congress, consideration was given to the special situations in the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. It legally confirmed the policy of establishing special administrative regions after the recovery of Hong Kong and Macau's sovereignty and after achieving unification with Taiwan, and maintaining the capitalist systems in these regions unchanged. Article 31 of the Constitution states: "The state may establish special administrative regions when necessary. The systems implemented in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law by the National People's Congress in accordance with specific conditions." This affirms the idea that within a unified country, two different social systems can be implemented in the form of a fundamental law of the state.
On June 26, 1983, Deng Xiaoping received a group of visiting American guests, including the renowned professor Yang Liyu from Seton Hall University in New Jersey. During the meeting, based on the discussions of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping elaborated on the essence and specific ideas of the policy of peaceful reunification. He said, "The core issue is the reunification of the motherland. Peaceful reunification has become the common language of both the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. But it is not a matter of one side swallowing the other, nor is it a matter of you swallowing me." Instead, it is the implementation of two systems within one country. We will steadfastly adhere to the policy of peaceful reunification. After the reunification of the motherland, the local government in Taiwan can implement its own policies, have its own independence in internal affairs; it does not need to go to Beijing for judicial power and final appellate power; the military will be independent; the mainland will not send military or political personnel to Taiwan; Taiwan's party, government, and military systems will be managed by Taiwan itself; and the central government must reserve a quota for Taiwan. Deng Xiaoping also said that the implementation of "one country, two systems" is to complete the great cause of reunification that previous leaders did not accomplish. If the Communist Party and the Kuomintang jointly accomplish this, the history of the Chiang family will be written in a better light.
At the time, the domestic news media did not pay special attention to this meeting and Deng Xiaoping's speech. A month later, Yang Liyu published an article in the Hong Kong magazine "Wide Angle Mirror," introducing the circumstances of the meeting and the main content of Deng Xiaoping's conversation. Deng Xiaoping's speech immediately received strong reactions from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and both domestic and overseas Chinese, and it was widely praised as the "Six Points of Deng." The publication of the "Six Points of Deng" marked the complete formation of the concept of "one country, two systems." In May 1984, this scientific concept was officially incorporated into the Government Work Report passed at the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress, becoming a fundamental national policy with legal guarantees.
Deng Xiaoping answered the question of what "one country, two systems" actually meant on multiple occasions and to different audiences. In June 22 and 23, 1984, when he respectively met with a visiting delegation of Hong Kong businessmen and prominent figures including Zhong Shi Yuan, he provided the most concise, specific, easy-to-understand, and memorable explanation. He said, "Our policy is to implement 'one country, two systems.' Specifically, it means that within the People's Republic of China, with its billion population, we implement a socialist system on the mainland, and capitalist systems are implemented in Hong Kong and Taiwan."
"One country, two systems" is a complete scientific concept. Here, the premise is one China, without which there can be no talk of reunification. One China refers to the People's Republic of China, and it is not permissible to have any form or disguised form of "two Chinas," "one country, two governments," "one China, one Taiwan," "two equivalent political entities," "the Republic of China in Taiwan," or "Taiwan as a sovereign independent country."
Under the premise of "One China", the main body of the country is socialist. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the main body of China must be socialist. In mainland China, we must resolutely adhere to the socialist system. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, through the joint efforts of the people, socialism has taken root firmly in the mainland. Practice has proved and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. Therefore, in the mainland, we must uphold socialism. Under the premise of adhering to "One China", socialism is practiced in mainland China while capitalism is practiced in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. In these regions, the current social and economic systems remain unchanged, lifestyles remain unchanged, and existing laws remain basically unchanged. Taiwan is also allowed to retain its military. This system will remain unchanged for a considerable period of time.
The policy of "One Country, Two Systems" has aroused strong reactions at home and abroad. On August 27, 1984, the Hong Kong Ming Pao published an editorial stating that "One Country, Two Systems" is the "fundamental principle of Marxism today." In 1984, the America Chinese Daily published an editorial titled "A Major Event in the History of International Relations", believing that the implementation of "One Country, Two Systems" in Hong Kong and mainland China will have far-reaching impacts on China's reunification and world affairs. The Taiwanese authorities have stubbornly refused to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party and have made many self-serving remarks about the Hong Kong issue, only to further alienate Taiwan from people both domestically and internationally. I hope the Taiwanese authorities change their course, follow the tide of history, or it will be too late to regret.
4. Launch negotiations for the return of Hong Kong and Macau in accordance with the policy of "One Country, Two Systems".
Although the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" was originally proposed to resolve the Taiwan issue, it was first successfully applied to resolve the Hong Kong and Macau issues.
The Hong Kong issue is a historical legacy of British colonial aggression against China. The Hong Kong region includes Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories, which have always been Chinese territories. After the Opium War in 1840, the British forced the Qing government to sign the unequal treaties of the Treaty of Nanjing, Treaty of Beijing, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, forcibly occupying the Hong Kong, Kowloon, and New Territories regions and subjecting Hong Kong to British colonial rule. The successive Chinese governments since the 1911 Revolution have not recognized the aforementioned unequal treaties, and have conducted multiple negotiations with the British to recover Hong Kong. In the eve of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, due to the special domestic and international circumstances, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong decided to "temporarily leave Hong Kong alone". After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government adopted a policy of "long-term planning, full utilization" for Hong Kong, not recognizing the three unequal treaties imposed by imperialism on China. However, considering historical reasons, the status quo was temporarily maintained and resolved peacefully through negotiation at the appropriate time.
According to the provisions of the aforementioned unequal treaties, the "New Territories", which accounts for 92% of the entire Hong Kong area and concentrates the major energy and industrial sectors, will expire on June 30, 1997. As the expiration of the lease on the "New Territories" approaches, the question of whether the land lease can be extended beyond "97" becomes more urgent, causing hesitation among investors. In order to extend the period of governance over Hong Kong, in March 1979, the British sent Governor MacLehose to visit Beijing, attempting to understand the Chinese government's attitude towards the Hong Kong question. Deng Xiaoping pointed out during the meeting that it has always been our belief that the sovereignty of Hong Kong belongs to the People's Republic of China, but Hong Kong also has its special status. The position of the Chinese government does not affect the investment interests of investors. This is why Hong Kong can have its capitalism during a long period of time in the 20th and early 21st centuries, while we practice our socialism.
In early 1981, Deng Xiaoping proposed that the Hong Kong issue has been put on the agenda and we must have a clear policy and attitude. Subsequently, he instructed the establishment of a specialized group to discuss countermeasures for the Hong Kong issue. In December of that year, the Central Secretariat Meeting made the decision to reclaim Hong Kong sovereignty on July 1, 1997. In April 1982, when Deng Xiaoping met with former British Prime Minister Heath, he explained the Chinese government's basic stance on resolving the Hong Kong issue, clearly stating that now is the time to consider dealing with the Hong Kong issue.
In June 1982, when Deng Xiaoping met with prominent figures from Hong Kong, he officially announced the Chinese government's basic position and principles for dealing with the Hong Kong issue: first, Hong Kong must be reclaimed by 1997, to restore sovereignty, no later than that; second, on the premise of restoring sovereignty, to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. At the same time, the research group approved by the central government went to Hong Kong to conduct investigations and studies, and formulated the Twelve Policies for resolving the Hong Kong issue, with "one country, two systems" as the core. The main essence of these policies is to restore sovereignty, maintain unchanged systems, let Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong, and ensure a high degree of autonomy. These policies further specified the guidelines for resolving the Hong Kong issue according to the principle of "one country, two systems," thus laying a foundation for the Sino-British negotiations to resolve the Hong Kong issue.
On September 24, 1982, when Deng Xiaoping met with British Prime Minister Thatcher, he explicitly expounded the Chinese government's basic position on the Hong Kong issue: first, the question of sovereignty is not open for discussion. China has no room to maneuver on this issue. China and the UK negotiate and discuss ways and means to resolve the Hong Kong issue on this premise. Second, after China reclaims Hong Kong in 1997, policies suitable for Hong Kong will be implemented. Hong Kong will continue to practice capitalism. Third, the Chinese and British governments need to properly negotiate how to avoid major fluctuations in Hong Kong during the fifteen years from now until 1997.
Based on the principles put forward by Deng Xiaoping, formal negotiations between China and the UK on the Hong Kong issue officially began. The entire negotiation lasted for two years and can be broadly divided into two stages: the first stage from September 1982 to June 1983, during which the two sides held preliminary discussions on some fundamental and procedural issues, and the Chinese side finalized its Hong Kong policies; the second stage from July 1983 to September 1984, during which substantive negotiations were conducted, leading to the formation of the Sino-British agreement text on the Hong Kong issue based on the Chinese policy.
In September 1984, China and the UK reached an agreement. On December 19 of the same year, the heads of state of China and Britain officially signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue in Beijing, announcing that the government of the People's Republic of China would restore sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and the British government would hand over Hong Kong to China on that day. During the transitional period from the date of effectiveness of the Joint Declaration to June 30, 1997, the British government would be responsible for the administrative management of Hong Kong, with cooperation from the Chinese government. The two-year Sino-British negotiation came to a successful conclusion. On May 27, 1985, the two governments exchanged the instruments of ratification for the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its three annexes in Beijing, and the Joint Declaration came into effect. Hong Kong entered the transitional period before the restoration of Chinese sovereignty.
After Hong Kong entered the transition period, the Chinese government began to formulate the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. On April 10, 1985, during the third session of the Sixth National People's Congress, the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee was established to be responsible for drafting the Basic Law. On July 1, the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee was officially established and began its work. In February 1990, after extensive solicitation of opinions and repeated revisions, the ninth plenary session of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee deliberated on the draft Basic Law and submitted it for review and approval by the National People's Congress. On April 4, during the third session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" and its three annexes: "Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", "Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Its Voting Procedures", and "National Laws Applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", as well as the flag and emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, were reviewed and passed. The cooperation between China and the UK in resolving the Hong Kong issue basically went smoothly in the 1980s.
With the launch of the Hong Kong's return process, the issue of Macau's return also came on the agenda. As early as 1974, the Portuguese government announced the abandonment of all overseas colonies and recognized Macau as Chinese territory rather than a colony. In February 1979, China and Portugal established diplomatic relations and reached an understanding on the issue of Macau. The Portuguese government recognized Macau as Chinese territory, and both sides agreed to settle the issue through negotiations between the two governments at an appropriate time.
In the autumn of 1984, the Chinese and British governments reached an agreement on the Hong Kong issue, and the conditions for resolving the Macau issue through negotiations between China and Portugal became mature. On October 6 of the same year, when Deng Xiaoping met with prominent figures from Macau, he further elaborated on the principles of resolving the Macau issue: the resolution of the Macau issue would also be conducted in accordance with the principles used to resolve the Hong Kong issue, namely "one country, two systems", "Macau people ruling Macau", and unchanged for 50 years. In June 1986, the Chinese and Portuguese governments began negotiations on the Macau issue. On April 13, 1987, the prime ministers of China and Portugal officially signed the "Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the Question of Macau" in Beijing. The declaration announced that Macau is Chinese territory, and the People's Republic of China government would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macau on December 20, 1999. On January 15, 1988, representatives of the two governments exchanged instruments of ratification of the Joint Declaration in Beijing, officially entering the transitional period of Macau's return.
Chapter 5: The Theory of the Primary Stage of Socialism and the "Three-Step" Development Strategy
I. The Proposal of the Theory of the Primary Stage of Socialism and the Establishment of the Party's Basic Line
During the period from the 12th National Congress to the 13th National Congress of the Party, under the guidance of the spirit of the 12th National Congress, the entire party and the people of the whole country made efforts to create a new situation in the socialist modernization construction, and achieved certain progress through exploration and efforts. On this basis, the 13th National Congress of the Party was held in victory in 1987, marking the formal establishment of the Party's basic line in the primary stage.
1. Preparation and holding of the 13th National Congress of the Party
On October 25, 1987, the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was grandly opened at the Great Hall of the People. The convening of the 13th National Congress was decided in September 1986 at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Party. Subsequently, the Party Central Committee began preparations for the 13th National Congress. The preparations for the 13th National Congress mainly consisted of two aspects:
The first aspect was the election of delegates to attend the congress. According to the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, the number of representatives for the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party is 1950. The central committee requires that the composition of representatives should be broad. There should be an appropriate proportion of minority party members and women party members. Special attention should be paid to the election of a certain number of young and middle-aged party members who have made outstanding achievements in socialist modernization construction and various reforms.
Through democratic elections, 1936 representatives with broad representation were selected. Among them, cadres at all levels accounted for 75.7%, personnel from various fields such as economy, science and technology, culture, education, sports and health accounted for 18.9%, famous model workers and heroic fighters accounted for 5.4%. Women accounted for 14.9%. Minorities accounted for 10.8%. Those with a college education or higher accounted for 59.5%. Among the representatives, there are a certain proportion of old party members who joined the party from the early days of the party to the period of the liberation war, and the majority are party members of the new China. There are veterans of the proletarian revolution and energetic young and outstanding party members, with those under 55 accounting for 58.8%.
The second point is the preparation of the conference documents. The Party Central Committee established a drafting group for the political report. The entire drafting work was carried out under the care and guidance of Deng Xiaoping.
On March 21, 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the head of the drafting group at the time, made a written report and request to Deng Xiaoping regarding the outline of the draft report for the Thirteenth National Congress. Seven parts were proposed for the report: (1) Talk about the historical changes that have occurred in China since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, including since the Twelfth National Congress. (2) Talk about the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which is a Marxist line based on China's national conditions. Emphasize that China is still in the primary stage of socialism, which is the fundamental basis for adopting the current policy instead of other policies. (3) The economic development strategy derived from this. (4) The task of developing a socialist commodity economy and the direction of China's economic system reform derived from this. (5) The task of building a socialist democratic politics and the principles of China's political system reform derived from this. (6) The task of strengthening and improving the Party's leadership, including the leadership system of the ruling party, inner-party democracy, supervision of party leaders, party cadres, and party conduct. (7) The necessity of avoiding "left" and right" tendencies in theoretical and ideological guidance, emphasizing the two basic points of the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which are sticking to the Four Cardinal Principles and adhering to reform and opening up to invigorate. It points out that in new practices, there must be creative theoretical exploration.
The request also proposed that the Thirteenth National Congress's political report should be based on the theory of the primary stage of socialism. Why should the theory of the primary stage of socialism be used as the basis for argumentation? The request said: to confirm that China is in the primary stage of socialism, first, it is to clearly state that we are socialist and cannot go back to capitalism; full-scale westernization is harmful to the country and the people. Second, it is to clearly state that we are in the primary stage of socialism, and we can only progress gradually, we cannot rush or seek perfection prematurely. It seems that by discussing the primary stage of socialism, it is possible to clarify the need to avoid both "left" and right" tendencies, as well as the nature and basis of our reform. If this can be achieved, it would be beneficial for achieving a unified understanding within the party and for ensuring long-term stability in foreign understanding of our policies. Please indicate if you agree. If so, the drafting of the report will proceed in this direction, and a rough draft can be expected by early May, with revisions until July and then submitted for central review at Beidaihe. If not, please give instructions!
Four days later, Deng Xiaoping gave instructions: "This design is good."
On November 16, 1987, Deng Xiaoping said during a meeting with Tatsuko Doi, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party: "The report of our Party's Thirteenth National Congress was collectively written, reflecting the wisdom of several thousand people. Many of its contents were not proposed by me. Of course, there were also my views and opinions, but the majority were collective opinions."
After the initial draft of the political report of the Thirteenth National Congress was released, the CPC Central Committee invited leaders of various democratic parties, relevant organizations, and some non-party patriotic intellectuals, as well as representatives from ethnic and religious communities, to hold a week-long symposium to solicit their opinions on the draft. At the symposium, participants freely expressed their opinions and put forward valuable suggestions for modification.
On October 20, 1987, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the CPC discussed and approved the report of the Central Committee to the Thirteenth National Congress, as well as the partial amendments to the Party Constitution. There was unanimous agreement to submit these two documents for deliberation at the Thirteenth National Congress.
With this, the preparations for the Thirteenth National Congress of the CPC were fully completed.
On the morning of October 25, the Thirteenth National Congress of the CPC opened at the Great Hall of the People.
The delegates, carrying the heavy responsibility of 46 million party members, wearing the red attendance badges, happily arrived at the Great Hall of the People to attend the opening ceremony. Among them were veteran proletarian revolutionaries and outstanding middle-aged and young people who had made contributions to reform and opening up. Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, non-party Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, leaders of various democratic parties, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, as well as non-party patriotic intellectuals, representatives from ethnic and religious communities, were invited as guests and seated at the presidium. Some members of the Twelfth Central Committee who were not delegates to the Thirteenth National Congress, members of the Central Advisory Commission, members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and some old comrades within the Party and other relevant personnel attended the meeting.
Deng Xiaoping presided over the congress and announced its opening. Zhao Ziyang delivered the political report on behalf of the Twelfth Central Committee.
The political report was divided into seven parts: (1) Historic achievements and the tasks of this congress; (2) The primary stage of socialism and the Party's basic line; (3) Economic development strategy; (4) Economic system reform; (5) Political system reform; (6) Strengthening Party building in the course of reform and opening up; (7) Striving for new victories for Marxism in China.
The report clearly put forward and expounded on the theory of the socialist stage, namely: First, our country is already a socialist society. We must adhere to and not deviate from socialism. Second, our socialist society is still in its primary stage. We must start from this reality and not surpass this stage. The primary stage of socialism in our country is not a generic reference to the initial stage that any country entering socialism will go through, but specifically refers to the specific stage that our country must go through in constructing socialism under the conditions of backward productive forces and underdeveloped commodity economy. This stage will take at least hundreds of years. 
Based on the theory of the primary stage of socialism, the report formulates the Party's basic line during the primary stage of socialism, which is: to lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, with economic construction as the central task, uphold the four basic principles, adhere to reform and opening up, self-reliance, hard work, and strive to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country.
The report summarizes the 12 basic points of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, namely: emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, taking practice as the sole criterion for testing truth; building socialism must be based on our own national conditions and follow our own path; in the conditions of backward economy and culture, building socialism must go through a long primary stage; the fundamental task of socialist society is to develop productive forces and concentrate efforts on modernization; socialist economy is a planned commodity economy; reform is an important driving force for the development of socialist society, opening up is a necessary condition for realizing socialist modernization; socialist democratic politics and socialist spiritual civilization are important features of socialism; upholding the four basic principles and adhering to the overall policy of reform and opening up are two basic points that must be combined and cannot be separated; "one country, two systems" is used to achieve national unity; the style of the ruling party is related to the life and death of the party; the principles of independence, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs are used to develop relations with foreign communist parties and other political parties; peace and development are the themes of the contemporary world.
The report formally formulates the "Three-Step Development Strategy" for economic development. The first step is to double the gross national product compared to 1980 and solve the problem of people's basic needs. The second step is to double the gross national product again by the end of the twentieth century and achieve a moderate level of living for the people. The third step is to reach the level of moderately developed countries in terms of per capita gross national product by the middle of the twenty-first century, with the people's living conditions being relatively affluent and realizing basic modernization.
The report also formulates an action plan to accelerate economic and political system reform and officially puts political system reform on the agenda of the Party. Regarding economic system reform, focusing on transforming the enterprise management mechanism as the central link, phased reforms are carried out in areas such as planning, investment, pricing, finance, and foreign trade to establish the basic framework of a new planned commodity economy system. Political system reform aims to eliminate disadvantages and build a socialist democratic political system with Chinese characteristics. The long-term goal of reform is to establish a highly democratic, fully legal, efficient, and dynamic socialist political system. The short-term goal of political system reform is to establish leadership system that is conducive to improving efficiency, enhancing vitality, and stimulating various initiatives.
In addition, the report explicitly puts forward the criterion of productivity, that is, whether it is conducive to the liberation and development of social productive forces as the standard to evaluate reform measures and other party policies.
After eight days of intense and orderly work, the 13th National Congress of the Party successfully completed all tasks, and the Congress elected the 13th Central Committee, the 2nd Central Advisory Committee, and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The Congress closed on November 1st in a democratic and united atmosphere.
The Congress calls on all Party comrades to, under the banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the leadership of the 13th Central Committee, adhere to the Party's basic line, firmly grasp the "one central task, two basic points" as stipulated by this basic line, strengthen Party unity, strengthen close ties with the people of the whole country, work together with one heart and one mind, inspire spirits, work hard, forge ahead, and strive to achieve the grand goal of socialist modernization.
The conference emphasized that the entire party must resolutely implement the party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism as formulated in the conference, conscientiously implement the resolutions passed by the conference, strive to complete the tasks proposed by the conference, and lead the people of all ethnic groups to continue moving forward along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the conference, many political parties and organizations from other countries called to congratulate the conference. Representatives of democratic parties, non-party patriotic democrats in China also expressed their congratulations to the conference, and the presidium of the conference expressed gratitude to them. 
On November 2, the first plenary session of the 13th Central Committee was held, and the meeting elected members of the Politburo of the Central Committee, including Wan Li, Tian Jiyun, Qiao Shi, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Tieying, Li Ruihuan, Li Ximing, Yang Rudai, Yang Shangkun, Wu Xueqian, Song Ping, Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, Hu Yaobang, Yao Yilin, Qin Jiwei, and alternate members of the Politburo Ding Guangen; members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo Qiao Shi, Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng, Hu Qili, Yao Yilin; General Secretary of the Central Committee Zhao Ziyang; Secretaries of the Central Secretariat Hu Qili, Qiao Shi, Rui Xingwen, Yan Mingfu, and alternate Secretary Wen Jiabao; and the decision to appoint Deng Xiaoping as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhao Ziyang as First Vice Chairman, and Yang Shangkun as Executive Vice Chairman. The plenary session approved Chen Yun as Director of the Central Advisory Committee and Qiao Shi as Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. 
It is worth noting that in the new Central Committee, a large number of relatively young comrades were selected, while a group of outstanding and respected old proletarian revolutionaries retired. This vividly demonstrates the vigorous development of our party's cause, and is a reliable guarantee for the continued and stable implementation of our party's correct line. 
Compared with the previous central leadership structure, the average age of the Politburo, the Standing Committee of the Politburo, and the Central Secretariat has significantly decreased. The average age of the members and alternate members of the 12th Central Committee when they were elected was 59.1 years old, while that of the 13th Central Committee is 55.2 years old, fully showing that our party's cause is flourishing, vibrant, and has successors. At this conference, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and other old proletarian revolutionaries withdrew from the Central Committee and the Politburo of the Party, which played a very important role in further rejuvenating the central leadership body and the new and old alternation of the leadership structure. 
This conference is a democratic, united, open, comprehensive conference to promote reform and construction, and also a conference that makes our party more vibrant and vigorous.
2. The Deepening of Understanding of the "Primary Stage of Socialism" and Its Historical Significance 
It is the primary issue to correctly understand the historical stage in which our society is currently located, and it is the fundamental basis for us to formulate and implement correct lines and policies in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
In building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the primary issue is, of course, to understand the national conditions of China. On this issue, both the Soviet Union and China have profound lessons. 
The Soviet Union was the world's first socialist country. Its greatest achievement is to turn socialism from theory into reality. But in a country like the Soviet Union, there was no ready-made successful experience for us on how to build socialism. At the time, the situation in the Soviet Union was very difficult. The domestic hostile forces wanted to overthrow the Soviet power, and the international enemies wanted to strangle the socialist system that had not yet stood firm. Faced with internal and external pressures, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, finally overcame various difficulties. Socialism not only stood firm but also presented a thriving scene. Based on practice, Lenin proposed: From the standpoint of communism, to deny political parties means to leap from the eve of capitalism's collapse (in Germany) to its highest stage, communism, rather than to its lower and middle stages. We were still in the initial stage of transition from capitalism to socialism and to communism in Russia (the third year after the overthrow of the bourgeoisie). After Lenin's death, just over 12 years later, Stalin declared in 1936: "Our Soviet society has basically achieved socialism, established the socialist system, and realized the system known to Marxists as the first stage or lower stage of communism." Three years later, Stalin declared again: "We are moving towards communism." This practice was obviously rash. After Stalin's death, Khrushchev pushed the idea of rushing towards communism to the extreme. Following the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which proposed comprehensive communist construction, Khrushchev proposed at the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1961 that the Soviet Union would take 20 years to basically build a communist society. The new program adopted by the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was: "Our generation will live under the communist system." When boasting about the significance of this program, Khrushchev said, "The three programs of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are like a three-stage rocket. The first stage enables us to break away from the capitalist world, the second stage elevates us to socialism, and the task of the third stage is to introduce communism." 
Twenty years passed and the plan completely failed, becoming a mirage, which showed that the Soviet Union's estimation of the stages of social development did not match reality. It was not until the 1980s that the Soviet Union and some countries in Eastern Europe began to reevaluate the stage of their own social development. 
The Communist Party of China also took a detour in understanding the historical stage in which China was situated. 
After 28 years of effort, the Communist Party of China achieved great victory in the new democratic revolution, and in a relatively short period of time, it restored the national economy and carried out socialist transformation, establishing a socialist system in China. Regarding the national conditions of China, Mao Zedong analyzed it as follows at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: In terms of the proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, modern industry accounted for about 10% and agriculture and handicraft industry accounted for about 90% in the country as a whole. This was the manifestation of the oppression of imperialist and feudal systems on China. This was the manifestation of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of old China in the economic sphere. This was also the fundamental starting point for all periods during the Chinese revolution and for a considerable period after the revolutionary victory. Based on this point, a series of strategic, tactical, and policy issues emerged within our party. 
Based on this analysis, Mao Zedong proposed the major economic policies that our party should implement after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. After the establishment of New China, in the process of socialist transformation, our party made adjustments to some of the policies put forward by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee based on the new situation, and the basic spirit was implemented. However, after the basic completion of socialist transformation, we relaxed our investigation and analysis of the new national conditions. We should have drawn the necessary conclusions based on the 10% modern industry and 90% agriculture and handicraft industry. Unfortunately, at that time, we were too excited about the victory of socialist transformation and distanced ourselves from reality, taking a circuitous route. 
The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China marked a major turning point in China's history. With the launch of rectification, when the Party analyzed the tortuous path and causes of development mistakes that China has gone through since the establishment of New China, it began to involve the issue of the stage of social development in China. In 1979, in his speech at the thirtieth anniversary of the National Day, Ye Jianying pointed out: "Compared with the capitalist system, which has already had a history of three to four hundred years, socialism is still in its infancy. "Our country is still a developing socialist country." This already includes the idea of the primary stage.
In 1981, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) passed the "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues of the Communist Party of China since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," which clearly stated for the first time that our socialist system is still in the primary stage. However, there is no doubt that China has established a socialist system and entered a socialist society. Any viewpoint that denies this basic fact is incorrect.
The political report of the Twelfth CPC National Congress in 1982 stated that our socialist society is still in the early stage of development and that material civilization is not yet highly developed.
The "Resolution on the Guiding Principles of Socialist Spiritual Civilization Construction by the CPC Central Committee" passed at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the CPC in 1986 stated: "Our country is still in the primary stage of socialism. We must not only implement the principle of distribution according to work and develop a socialist commodity economy and competition, but also, for a considerable period of time, develop various economic components under the condition of public ownership as the mainstay and encourage the well-off of a certain part of the population under the goal of common prosperity." 
These three important documents all put forward the major theoretical proposition of "the primary stage of socialism" in China and made clear and scientific explanations of it, but they did not play a role.
The political report of the Thirteenth CPC National Congress systematically expounded on this issue of significant theoretical and practical significance for the first time and used it as the basis for the entire report, clearly affirming that China is currently in the primary stage of socialism, and clarifying the two levels of meaning of the primary stage of socialism: first, our society is already a socialist society. We must adhere to socialism and cannot deviate from it. Second, the socialist society in China is still in the early stage.
The content of the primary stage of socialism in our country not only refers to the first stage or the earliest stage in the development sequence, but mainly refers to a special stage of development for a country with underdeveloped economy and culture like China. Its meaning has two levels: first, in terms of the nature of society, China has already reached socialism and is not in a transitional period. Therefore, we must adhere to the socialist direction and road and cannot go back to capitalism or engage in "full Westernization" or "capitalist lessons." Any tendency to go backwards and deviate from the socialist track is incompatible with the socialist nature. Second, in terms of the level of development, the maturity level of China's socialist society is still very low, only at the primary stage, not at a higher stage. Therefore, we must start from this most basic and important national condition and objective reality, engage in construction and reform, and cannot demand excessively high achievements. The proposition of the primary stage of socialism, by clearly distinguishing it from the transitional period and the higher stage of socialism, provides a scientific foundation for our party's line, principles, and policies, thereby avoiding the left-wing mistakes of surpassing the stage in the past.
China is in the primary stage of socialism due to the level of its productive forces. The political report of the Thirteenth CPC National Congress analyzed it as follows: on the one hand, the socialist economic system based on public ownership of the means of production, the socialist political system of people's democratic dictatorship, and the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field have already been established; the system of exploitation and the exploiting classes have been eliminated; the national economic strength has experienced significant growth, and education, science, and cultural undertakings have developed considerably. On the other hand, China has a large population, a weak foundation, and its per capita GDP still ranks low in the world. The prominent features are as follows: with a population of over one billion, eight hundred million live in rural areas and still rely mostly on manual tools for their livelihood; there is a certain amount of modern industries coexisting with a large number of industries that are several decades or even hundreds of years behind the modern level; economically developed areas coexist with underdeveloped and impoverished areas; although there are a few areas with world-advanced scientific and technological levels, the overall level of science and technology is not high, and illiteracy and semi-literacy still account for nearly one-fourth of the population. The backwardness of productivity determines that the degree of production socialization necessary for the development of socialist public ownership is still low. The commodity economy and domestic market are not well developed, and natural economy and semi-natural economy account for a considerable proportion. The socialist economic system is still immature. In terms of the superstructure, a series of economic and cultural conditions necessary for the construction of highly socialist democratic politics are insufficient. Feudalism, decaying capitalist ideology, and the habits of small-scale production have a widespread influence in society and often infiltrate the ranks of the party cadres and government officials. This situation indicates that we are far from surpassing the primary stage of socialism today.
The primary stage of socialism in our country is a relatively long historical stage. As pointed out in the political report of the 13th National Congress: From the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private ownership of the means of production in the 1950s to the basic realization of socialist modernization, it will take at least hundreds of years, all of which belong to the primary stage of socialism.
In this stage, the main contradiction we face is the contradiction between the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backwardness of social production. Therefore, in order to solve the main contradiction, we must give top priority to liberating and developing the productive forces and always take economic construction as the central task.
China is in the primary stage of socialism, not in a general sense, but in a specific sense. The so-called not in a general sense means that it is not the initial stage that any country enters into after entering socialist society. Developed capitalist countries and countries with medium development levels do not need to go through such a "primary stage" after entering socialist society. The so-called specific sense means that countries like us, which were originally economically and culturally backward, must go through a specific historical stage after entering socialist society, which is the "primary stage". So, what kind of historical stage is the primary stage of socialism in our country? The political report of the 13th National Congress answered this question:
In summary, the primary stage of socialism in our country is a stage of gradually getting rid of poverty and backwardness; it is a stage where the agrarian country based on manual labor of the majority of the agricultural population gradually transforms into a modern industrial country with a majority of non-agricultural population; it is a stage where the natural economy and semi-natural economy, which account for a significant proportion, transform into a highly developed commodity economy; it is a stage where a vibrant socialist economic, political, and cultural system is established and developed through reform and exploration; it is a stage where the whole nation rises up, works hard, and realizes the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Based on the reality of the primary stage of socialism, we must concentrate our efforts on modernization construction, uphold comprehensive reform, adhere to opening up, give priority to the public sector while vigorously developing the commodity economy, take stability and unity as a premise, and strive to build a democratic political system. We must also take Marxist ideology as guidance and strive to build spiritual civilization.
The Chinese Communist Party's recognition of the primary stage of socialism in our country has significant theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, it enriches and develops the theory of Marxist socialism development stages, providing a scientific basis for our party to formulate correct lines and policies. In practice, it guides our country's reform, opening up, and construction along the path of scientific socialism, helping us to guard against both "left" and right deviations. If we cannot see that our country has already achieved socialism, there is a possibility of making right-wing errors. If we do not recognize that our country is in the primary stage of socialism, there is a possibility of making "left" errors. The recognition roots of both "left" and right deviations stem from being divorced from reality, from the national conditions, and from not realizing that our country is in the primary stage of socialism.
3. Deep analysis of the "one central task and two basic points"
Based on the judgment that China is in the primary stage of socialism, the political report of the 13th National Congress put forward the Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism, which is to "lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, rely on our own efforts, work hard, and strive to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country."
This basic line of thinking is not easy to obtain.
The basic line or general line refers to the party's fundamental guiding principles in a large historical stage. All other policies and measures must be subordinate to and serve the basic line or general line. Because of the significant importance of the basic line, the party's top leaders attach great importance to its formulation.
During the period of democratic revolution, the first generation leadership collective of the CPC with Mao Zedong as its core formulated the correct general line, which is: "a proletarian-led, people's, anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist revolution."
Under the guidance of this general line, the Communist Party of China led the people to drive away the Japanese aggressors, defeated Chiang Kai-shek and established the new China.
The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the basic completion of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the socialist revolution. During this period, our country was in the transition from new democracy to socialism. The party's general line during the transition period was: "from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation, this is a transitional period. The general line and overall task of the party during this transitional period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce." Practice has proved that this general line is correct. By implementing this general line, the socialist system in our country has been established, and our country's socialist industrialization has taken a gratifying step.
After our country entered the socialist society, our party put forward the general line of "gaining momentum and striving for the best, and promoting socialist construction in an all-round way with greater, faster, better and more economical results." As for this general line, the Resolution on Several Historical Issues passed in 1981 made the following evaluation: "In 1958, the correct aspect of the general line for socialist construction and its basic point approved at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Party Congress reflects the widespread desire of the people for urgently changing the backward economic and cultural conditions in our country, but the drawback is that it neglects the objective economic laws." This evaluation is objective. By implementing this general line, our country experienced the "Great Leap Forward" in the eagerness to develop productive forces and the eagerness to change production relations and transition to "people's communes". As a result, the desire for quick success ultimately led to failure. Violating economic laws, we suffered the consequences of these laws. After this, we achieved certain achievements on one hand, but on the other hand, we made mistakes, suffered setbacks, widened the gap between us and developed countries, and affected the demonstration of the superiority of socialism.
During the "Cultural Revolution", the 9th Party Congress proposed a basic line for the whole socialist historical stage, which was a "left" erroneous line with "class struggle as the key". It was not a "lifeline", but a "death line" that led the country towards collapse and chaos.
History is the mirror by which one can know the rise and fall of a nation. The Party has several basic lines or general lines in its history, some of which have been successful while others have taught valuable lessons through failure. Faced with history, the Party reflects, and so do its leaders. Why does one line lead to victory while another leads to failure, and what are the reasons behind this? The result of this reflection undoubtedly holds significant importance in shaping the Party's basic line during the primary stage of socialism. Its direct consequence is that the Party gradually formed its basic line during the primary stage of socialism by summarizing its historical experiences.
As early as 18 years before the concept of the "primary stage of socialism" was proposed, Zhou Enlai laid the initial foundation for the formation of this basic line in the Government Work Report during the first session of the Third National People's Congress held in December 1964. In the report, Zhou Enlai pointed out that the main task of future economic development is to transform our country into a socialist power with modern agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology at a relatively short historical period, catching up with and surpassing the advanced level of the world. In order to achieve this great historical task, starting from the third Five-Year Plan, the development of our national economy can be divided into two stages: the first stage is to establish an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system, and the second stage is to comprehensively modernize agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology, leading our country's economy to the forefront of the world.
This vision, hindered by erroneous interference from the "left," failed to become a reality, but its historical significance cannot be underestimated. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held at the end of 1978, reaffirmed the correct ideological line, rejected the previous "left" line that prioritized class struggle, shifted the focus of work to economic construction, and formulated the basic principles of reform and opening up. This laid a solid foundation for the formulation of the Party's basic line during the primary stage of socialism.
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Party repeatedly emphasized the importance of focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four fundamental principles, and carrying out reform and opening up. After successfully rectifying the chaos, the Party's 12th National Congress put forward the overall task for the Party in the new era, which is to unite all the people of our country, rely on our own efforts, work hard, gradually achieve modernization in industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology, and build our country into a highly civilized and democratic socialist state.
In September 1986, the 6th Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the overall layout of socialist modernization: focusing on economic construction, resolutely carrying out economic system reforms, resolutely carrying out political system reforms, resolutely strengthening the construction of spiritual civilization, and coordinating and promoting these aspects together. This "overall layout" already encompassed the main contents of the basic line summarized by the 13th National Congress, but it was still incomplete.
On January 28, 1987, the Communist Party of China Central Committee stated in its notice "Regarding Several Issues on Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization" that the line since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee is based on China's actual conditions to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The basic points of this line are twofold: adhering to the four fundamental principles and adhering to the policy of reform, opening up, and invigorating. The introduction of these "two basic points" directly prepared for the final formation of the basic line.
Under these circumstances and based on the theory of the primary stage of socialism, the 13th National Congress of the Party explicitly proposed and summarized the Party's basic line during the primary stage of socialism.
The key points of the Party's basic line during the primary stage of socialism are "placing economic construction at the center, adhering to the four fundamental principles, and persevering with reform and opening up," also known as the "one central task, two basic points."
The "one central task, two basic points" embodies Deng Xiaoping's painstaking efforts and condensed his strategy for national rejuvenation. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, led by Deng Xiaoping, implemented a strategic shift and decided on the basic national policy of reform and opening up. From then on, it led China's giant ship into a new era and new fields. However, Deng Xiaoping felt that something was missing. So, at the theoretical work conference in early 1979, Deng Xiaoping timely proposed to adhere to the four basic principles. After that, Deng Xiaoping always held onto the central link of economic construction and grasped the two basic points to promote the sustained and healthy development of Chinese society. When someone summarized the party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism as "one central task, two basic points," Deng Xiaoping expressed appreciation and believed it was well summarized.
"One central task, two basic points" are interrelated, interdependent, and indispensable.
"To take economic construction as the center" runs through the whole process of completing the fundamental task of socialism and is the red line for developing social productive forces. It not only reveals and defines the central position of economic construction in the work of the Party and the country, but also requires other tasks to be subordinate to and serve the center of economic construction, in order to ensure the development of social productive forces. Why should we adhere to economic construction as the center? This is because the fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces. Specifically, because our socialist system did not originate from a developed capitalist society like Russia, but rather from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society with a weak foundation and poor conditions. Although great achievements have been made in developing productive forces since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are still far behind developed countries. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to economic construction as the center, carry out socialist modernization, and concentrate our efforts on developing productive forces. "Adhering to reform and opening up" and "adhering to the four basic principles" are the two basic points, which revolve closely around the center of economic construction and the central task of developing productive forces. The basic characteristics of the primary stage of socialism are: underdeveloped productivity, immature production relations, and imperfect superstructure. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to reform. Reform and opening up are the only way for our country to develop social productive forces and achieve socialist modernization. The four basic principles are the fundamental guarantee for developing social productive forces and socialist modernization. The "two basic points" are the unity of adhering to the socialist direction and the self-improvement and development of the socialist system.
"One central task, two basic points" also constrain and promote each other. With the objective requirement of developing productivity as the benchmark, the center is to develop productive forces, while the "two basic points" are like the two wings of an aircraft, providing balance to the main body in the center position. The two basic points are constrained by the "one central task" while also mutually constraining each other.
The party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism not only defines "one central task, two basic points," but also defines our goal of struggle. This is to "strive to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and culturally advanced socialist modern country." Prosperity, democracy, and cultural advancement actually include requirements in the economic, political, and ideological and cultural aspects. This is not only a trinity modernization goal, but also three important aspects of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
"Prosperity" is the goal and requirement in the socio-economic field. A socialist society must be prosperous rather than poor. The 13th National Congress was the first to include "prosperity" as a goal of the party's struggle.
"Democracy" is the goal and requirement in political construction. Socialist democracy is substantially higher than capitalist democracy. Socialist democracy requires the broad masses of the people to participate in the management of the country and society, truly achieving "people as masters of their own affairs".
"Civilization" refers to spiritual civilization, which is the goal and requirement in the ideological and cultural field. Socialist spiritual civilization is an important characteristic of socialism. To construct socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to eliminate various forms of ignorance and backwardness left over from the old society. For a long period in the past, our understanding of socialism was not completely clear, and we did not formulate a scientific goal that suits our national conditions. This lack of clarity was an important manifestation of this.
The goal of striving for prosperity, democracy, and civilization is a three-dimensional reflection of our new understanding of socialism. This is a major achievement in understanding our national conditions and socialism since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.
The basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism stipulates the reliance on strength to achieve the goals of struggle. This is "leadership and unity of people of all ethnic groups". After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership system, the exploiting class as a class has been eliminated. Apart from a few hostile elements, the people of all ethnic groups in the country under the leadership of the Communist Party are the reliance in accomplishing the various tasks of the primary stage of socialism.
The basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism poses requirements for the spiritual state in accomplishing various tasks, namely, "self-reliance and hard work". What does China rely on for development? What does China rely on to achieve the goals of prosperity, democracy, and civilization? Foreign aid is undoubtedly important, but it is not our base point. Our base point is to rely on self-reliance. In other words, primarily relying on the strength of the people themselves, relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the people.
The Chinese people have a glorious tradition. They are indomitable in the face of difficulties. It is precisely relying on this spirit of hard struggle that they have overcome difficulties and won one victory after another. This spirit was a winning weapon in the era of revolutionary warfare, and it is also necessary to achieve the goal of a three-dimensional combination of prosperity, democracy, and civilization. To fulfill the historical mission of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the primary stage of socialism, people of all ethnic groups in China must actively engage in the tide of reform and construction with the attitude of masters. Only in this way can we become part of the world's civilized nations.
II. The introduction of the "Three-step Development" strategy
Starting from 1979, Deng Xiaoping began to design the specific blueprint for China's modernization and gradually formed the strategy of "two steps" to achieve a "two-fold increase" and reach the goal of a "moderately prosperous level" by the end of the 20th century.
The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) shouldered the historical task of shifting the focus of the Party's work and the attention of the people to socialist modernization construction. It reaffirmed the goal of achieving the four modernizations within the 20th century and put forward the need to "correctly resolve the specific paths, principles, methods, and measures to achieve the four modernizations". It should be said that the 3rd Plenary Session established the overall goal of the economic development strategy of "achieving the four modernizations" and put forward the basic principles to achieve this goal. However, what does the blueprint for the "four modernizations" look like? How can it be achieved through what means and steps? At that time, the understanding was still relatively abstract and vague.
1. New thinking on China's modernization development strategy
After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the second generation of the central leadership group with Deng Xiaoping at the core began to seriously contemplate and explore how to achieve China's modernization. In March 1979, Deng Xiaoping proposed in his speech "Adhere to the Four Fundamental Principles": "In the past, we carried out the democratic revolution, which had to be adapted to China's conditions and followed the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside opened up by Comrade Mao Zedong. Now, in doing construction, we must also adapt to China's conditions and follow a Chinese-style path of modernization." He also proposed, "Chinese-style modernization must start from China's characteristics". Deng Xiaoping summarized at least two important characteristics that must be seen in order for China to achieve modernization: one is a weak foundation and the other is a large population with limited arable land. These two characteristics determined that China's starting point for modernization was very low, so the time it would take to achieve modernization would be relatively long. China could only gradually achieve modernization step by step based on this low starting point. Afterward, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council discussed and studied how China could achieve socialist modernization. They believed that "in carrying out modernization, we must start from China's national conditions". The Central Work Meeting held in April 1979 analyzed China's national conditions and pointed out: "We are a populous country with more than 900 million people, of whom over 80% are farmers. Although we have achieved victory in the revolution for 30 years, our economy is still very backward and the living standards of our people are still very low. Our country is poor, and modernization requires a large amount of capital, while the people want to improve their lives. This is a contradiction; in carrying out modernization, we need fewer people, but we have a large amount of labor force that needs employment, which is also a contradiction. In such contradictions, we can only carry out the 'Four Modernizations'; this is the reality and the basic starting point that we must consider when planning and building the blueprint."
It was precisely based on the basic starting point of China's national conditions that Deng Xiaoping began to conceive the specific blueprint for China's modernization. This is both a requirement for the construction of modernization and an inevitable result of the logical development of Deng Xiaoping's thinking. On December 6, 1979, during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, Deng Xiaoping answered the question of how the blueprint for China's modernization was conceived, saying: "The four modernizations we want to achieve are Chinese-style four modernizations. Even if by the end of this century, our four modernizations have achieved certain goals, the average income of our nation will still be very low. In order to reach the level of a relatively well-off third world country, such as an average income of 1,000 US dollars, we still need to make great efforts."
Even if it reaches that level, compared to the West, China is still lagging behind. I can only say that China is still in a moderately prosperous state." Here, Deng Xiaoping first defined the four modernizations as reaching a level of "one thousand dollars" and entering a "moderately prosperous" state. The concepts of "one thousand dollars" and "moderately prosperous" were also formed during this conversation. Over a month later, when discussing his response to Prime Minister Takeo Miki's question, Deng Xiaoping said, "Of course, this answer is not accurate, but it is not said randomly either." Deng Xiaoping analyzed that currently, we only have a few hundred US dollars, if we were to reach 1000 dollars, it would need to triple. Singapore and Hong Kong have over 3000 dollars. It is not easy for us to reach that level because we have a vast territory and a large population, with conditions that are very different. But it should be said that if our GDP really reaches an average of 1000 dollars per person, then our lives will be much better than theirs, even better than their 2000 dollars. If the conversation between Deng Xiaoping and Prime Minister Miki was the first time that he discussed his vision for the next 20 years with a foreign guest, then in January 1980, in his speech titled "The Current Situation and Tasks," although he was just recounting his conversation with Prime Minister Miki, he presented his vision to the entire party for the first time. He pointed out: To realize the Chinese-style four modernizations, it will be accomplished in two decades, with each ten-year period consisting of important and determining stages. Therefore, the 1980s are very important and decisive. This decade lays a solid foundation while the following decade, within the next 20 years, will truly achieve the Chinese-style four modernizations and have real hope.
According to Deng Xiaoping's conception, in June 1981, the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee put forward the goal of "achieving modernization in a step-by-step and phased manner." In November 1981, at the Fourth Session of the 5th National People's Congress, the "moderately prosperous level" was defined as the prospect of China's economic development. The congress believed that the development speed during the sixth five-year plan cannot be fast, but there is hope for higher development speed during the seventh five-year plan, and even higher in the following decade. The congress proposed to strive to double the total output value of industry and agriculture within 20 years, achieving a moderately prosperous level of living for the people. By September 1982, at the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Deng Xiaoping's proposed "moderately prosperous" level was officially put forward and established as the strategic goal for the entire party and the entire Chinese nation towards the end of the 20th century. The report of the 12th Congress pointed out that from 1981 to the end of the 20th century, the overall main objective of China's economic construction is to continuously improve economic efficiency, strive to double the annual total output value of industry and agriculture nationwide, increase it from the 710 billion yuan in 1980 to around 2.8 trillion yuan in the year 2000, and have the people's material and cultural lives reach a moderately prosperous level. In order to achieve the goal of the 20-year struggle, it needs to be divided into two steps strategically. The first ten years mainly lay a solid foundation, accumulate strength, create conditions, and the following ten years will enter a new period of economic rejuvenation.
After proposing the "two-step approach" to achieve the goal of "moderate prosperity" by the end of the 20th century, Deng Xiaoping began to further conceive the economic development goals of China in the mid-21st century starting in 1984, gradually forming the complete "three-step approach" of economic development strategy.
2. The Brewing and Elaboration of the "Three-Step Approach" Development Strategy
The development strategy of the "three-step approach" began to be brewed before 1984. The original wording was to achieve the Four Modernizations by the end of the 20th century. Later, the Party gradually realized that this task could not be quickly completed by the end of the 20th century, so the term "reaching a moderately prosperous level" was used instead. Although the term "achieving the Four Modernizations by the end of this century" is still sometimes used, its meaning has gradually changed, and it is no longer used in terms of completion but in terms of stages. In this case, in September 1982, the 12th National Congress of the Party proposed the goal of achieving double the economic output. Since only a moderately prosperous level could be achieved by the end of the 20th century, it would take some time to reach the level of modernization. In December 1980, Deng Xiaoping said in his speech on "Implementing Adjustments and Ensuring Stability and Unity" that after reaching a moderately prosperous level, "we should continue to advance and gradually achieve a higher level of modernization." In November 1981, the government work report of the Fourth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress pointed out that when people's living standards reach a moderately prosperous level by the end of the 20th century, our country's economy can start from a new starting point and quickly reach the level of economically developed countries. It can be seen that at this time, the goal of reaching the level of economically developed countries in stages had begun to take shape. However, by 1984, the conditions for clearly proposing the "Three-step Development Plan" goals were not yet met because the achievement of the "moderately prosperous" goal still needed to be tested. Shortly after the 12th National Congress of the Party, on October 14, 1982, Deng Xiaoping had a conversation with the responsible comrades of the National Development and Reform Commission, saying, "Can we achieve double the economic output by the end of the 20th century? The 12th National Congress of the Party said we can, and I also believe we can, but whether we can achieve it remains to be seen in our future work." "We need to focus on long-term planning now, and the key to long-term planning is to prepare for the next decade." "Preparation is a matter of racing against time and cannot be taken lightly." Deng Xiaoping’s remarks mean that there is a risk of failing to achieve double the economic output if time is not seized and taken seriously. 
After the 12th National Congress of the Party proposed the goal of doubling the economic output, Deng Xiaoping's lingering question was whether the goal could be achieved or if it would fall through. From 1982 to 1984, China's economic development was very fast, greatly exceeding the economic growth rate stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Significant breakthroughs were achieved in rural reform, and in 1984, China's grain production reached a record high. Urban reform also began to take off, and the situation nationwide was encouraging. In early 1983, Deng Xiaoping inspected Jiangnan. He traveled through Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai and saw that the situation was very good. People were happy, many new houses were being built, the market was well stocked, and the cadres were confident. Seeing these vivid scenes, Deng Xiaoping believed that "it seems that the prospects for the Four Modernizations are very good." After returning to Beijing, when Deng Xiaoping talked to several responsible comrades of the Central Committee, he pointed out that in order to achieve double the economic output by the end of the 20th century, there needs to be a comprehensive and more specific plan, and each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government also needs to have its own specific plan and be well-informed. In March 1984, when he talked with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, Deng Xiaoping clearly stated, "The goal of doubling the economic output will not fall through." In June, when Deng Xiaoping met with the representative delegation of the Japanese side for the second meeting of the China-Japan Committee of Non-Governmental Personnel, he confidently stated that if China's economy continues to develop in the same way in the coming years, "the goal of doubling the economic output by the end of this century will surely be achieved." On October 1, at the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared that the recent situation indicates that the grand goal of doubling the economic output proposed by the 12th National Congress is achievable. 
Considering that achieving "moderate prosperity" by the end of the 20th century had already become a realistic goal, Deng Xiaoping, thinking about the future and long-term interests of the Chinese nation, began to contemplate the economic development strategy of China in the 21st century and design a grand blueprint. 
On April 18, 1984, Deng Xiaoping met with British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe. Before and after this, Deng Xiaoping had already made it clear that achieving a moderately prosperous society by the end of the 20th century was only the "minimum goal" of the Four Modernizations. So, how long will it take to achieve the "four modernizations" and the basic realization of modernization? He first proposed the idea of this question during a conversation with Jeffrey Howe. He said that compared to our grand goals, the development in the past few years is just the beginning. After reaching a moderately prosperous level, we still need to approach the level of developed countries within 30 to 50 years in the 21st century. Deng Xiaoping mentioned this idea repeatedly. On May 29th, when Deng Xiaoping met with Brazilian President Figredo, he said: China is still poor now, with a per capita GDP of only 300 US dollars. But we have ambitious goals, to reach 800 US dollars per capita by the end of the 20th century. 800 US dollars is not much for economically developed countries, but it is a true ambition for China. What's more important is that with this foundation, we can approach the level of developed countries in another 30 to 50 years of development. Subsequently, in three conversations on June 30th, October 6th, and October 22nd of the same year, Deng Xiaoping expressed his ideas in roughly the same language, that is, the per capita GDP would reach 800 US dollars by the end of the 20th century, not 1000 US dollars. This is because he considered that by the end of the 20th century, China's population would exceed one billion and needs to be controlled to around 1.2 billion. If the total GDP doubles and the population grows to 1.2 billion, then the per capita GDP would be a little over 800 US dollars. Later, Deng Xiaoping also used the flexible term "800 to 1000 US dollars", but sometimes still said "800 US dollars" or "1000 US dollars". In addition, the goal Deng Xiaoping mentioned at that time was to "approach the level of developed countries", and the required time was "30 to 50 years", which is not exactly the same as his later statements.
As time entered 1985, Deng Xiaoping's "Three-Step Development Strategy" moved forward. In his speech at the National Conference on Science and Technology on March 7th, 1985, he pointed out that we have been striving for decades to eradicate poverty. The first step is to reach a moderately prosperous level by the end of the 20th century, which means not being poor or rich, but having a relatively good life. The second step is to approach the level of developed countries economically within another 30 to 50 years, making the people relatively affluent. This is the overall situation. Deng Xiaoping's words in this passage have several new elements compared to his speech in 1984: firstly, he used the terms "first step" and "second step", which prepared for the later summary of the "Three-Step Development Strategy"; secondly, he explained the "moderately prosperous level" as not being poor or rich but having a relatively good life; thirdly, he equated "making the people relatively affluent" with approaching the level of developed countries as a goal to strive for; fourthly, he pointed out that this is the "overall situation" for the entire party and the country. On March 25th, 1985, in his conversation with American journalists and his conversation with Tanzanian Vice President Mwinyi on April 15th of the same year, Deng Xiaoping said that the first step is to reach a moderately prosperous level by the end of the 20th century. From the time this goal was proposed at the end of 1979 until the end of the 20th century, there are 20 years. Based on a GDP of one trillion US dollars, it will take another 30 to 50 years, or more precisely, 50 years, to come close to the level of developed countries and achieve our second-step goal. It will take 70 years to accomplish this. In these two conversations, Deng Xiaoping clearly extended the time span of China's economic development strategy from 20 years to 70 years and divided the development goals into two steps, making the strategic goals and deployments increasingly clear. In September 1985, the Communist Party of China held the National Congress. Deng Xiaoping pointed out at the meeting: People now say that China has undergone significant changes. I have mentioned to some foreign visitors that this is just a minor change. Doubling the income and achieving a moderate level of prosperity can be considered a medium change. It is only when we can approach the level of developed countries by the middle of the 21st century that we can say it is a major change. Deng Xiaoping used the terms "minor change," "medium change," and "major change" to clearly represent the three stages of economic development. This "three changes" clearly demonstrate the three stages of economic development, which are very similar to the later concept of the "three-step approach" that he summarized.
By 1987, Deng Xiaoping's strategic plan for the "three-step approach" was complete. The positive economic development trends in 1985 and 1986 indicated that most of the main indicators of China's Seventh Five-Year Plan could be achieved ahead of schedule, which meant that the strategic goal of doubling the income by 1990 could be achieved earlier than expected. This made Deng Xiaoping more confident and his vision for future economic development became clearer. On March 8, 1987, Deng Xiaoping told visiting Tanzanian President Mwinyi that in the past eight years, we have gained experience and achieved satisfying results in construction. "In the first decade, from 1981 to 1990, doubling the GDP is estimated to be easily achieved and can be completed ahead of schedule. In the second decade, from 1991 to the end of this century, doubling it again is also reliable based on the development trend. People's living standards have improved significantly in the past eight years since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee. By the end of this century, although our per capita GDP of 800 to 1,000 US dollars is not much, the annual GDP will exceed one trillion US dollars. With this foundation, it is hopeful to strive for the level of a moderately developed country." Deng Xiaoping has actually proposed the strategic plan of the "three-step approach" here, but just did not explicitly use the terms "first step," "second step," and "third step." Additionally, Deng Xiaoping changed the development strategic goal of our country from "approaching the level of developed countries" to "reaching the level of a moderately developed country" by the middle of the 21st century. On April 16 of the same year, when meeting with members of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, Deng Xiaoping again used the standard of a "moderately developed country" and quantified this goal as "per capita income of 4,000 US dollars" and "GDP of 60 trillion yuan," making the strategic goal of our country by the middle of the 21st century clear. On April 30 of the same year, when meeting with Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Lara, Deng Xiaoping explicitly and comprehensively described the economic development goals of the "three-step approach" for the first time. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our original target was to double the income in the 1980s. Based on the 1980 GDP per capita of only 250 US dollars, doubling it would reach 500 US dollars. The second step is to double it again by the end of the 20th century, reaching 1,000 US dollars per capita. Achieving this target means that we will enter a moderately prosperous society, transforming impoverished China into a moderately prosperous China. By then, the GDP will exceed one trillion US dollars, although the per capita figure will still be relatively low, but the strength of the country will greatly increase. The most important goal we have set is the third step, doubling the income again by two to three times in 30 to 50 years in the 21st century, to reach a per capita income of around 4,000 US dollars. By achieving this, China will reach the level of a moderately developed country. This is our ambitious goal."
At this point, Deng Xiaoping's vision for the "Three-Step Development Strategy" for China's modernization construction is complete.
3. Establishment of the "Three-Step Development Strategy"
Based on Deng Xiaoping's vision and the basic national conditions of China's primary stage of socialism, the Socialist Modernization Construction "Three-Step Development Strategy" was formally established at the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 1987. The report of the 13th National Congress stated, "After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the strategic arrangement for China's economic construction is roughly divided into three steps. The first step is to double the gross national production value compared to 1980 and solve the people's basic material needs. This task has been basically achieved. The second step is to double the gross national production value by the end of the 20th century and achieve a moderately prosperous standard of living for the people. The third step is to reach the per capita gross national production value of a moderately developed country by the middle of the 21st century, achieve a relatively affluent life for the people, and basically achieve modernization. Then, we will continue to advance on this basis." The formulation of the "Three-Step Development Strategy" for economic development resolves the significant issues regarding the goals and steps of China's modernization construction, and will have a profound and lasting impact on China's development in the coming decades.
Compared with China's previous development strategies, the characteristics of the Socialist Modernization Construction "Three-Step Development Strategy" are as follows: First, it is realistic. Compared with the goals of "surpassing Britain and the US in 15 years" and "achieving four modernizations by the end of this century," it is a lower goal, but it is indeed a realistic goal. The early achievement of the first step of the "Three-Step Development Strategy" is powerful evidence. Second, it starts and ends with the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. Using "basic needs," "moderately prosperous," and "affluent" as the goals of modernization allows the people to vividly and intuitively understand and experience the process of achieving these goals, mobilizes their enthusiasm, and strengthens their confidence, which is in line with the fundamental purpose of socialism. Third, it is explicit, specific, and quantifiable. Quantifying the goals as "1000 US dollars" and "4000 US dollars" makes the goals very clear, specific, and easy to operate and measure. Fourth, it is connected to the world economy. This goal uses the "US dollar" as the unit of measurement, considering and comparing China's economy within the broader scope of the world, making the gap between China and developed countries clear and placing China's economy in the development of the world economy. Fifth, it is not only an economic goal but also a political goal. The fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces, and modernization construction is China's greatest political task. Whether the strategic goals of the "Three-Step Development Strategy" can be achieved is related to the future and destiny of socialism. Therefore, it is not just an economic development goal but also a political goal.
The significance of achieving the strategic goals of the "Three-Step Development Strategy" is immense. It is a strategic goal that enables China to gradually move away from poverty and towards prosperity. To achieve this strategic goal, not only can it greatly enhance China's comprehensive national strength, significantly improve people's lives, greatly enhance China's international influence, and contribute greatly to humanity, but it can also better reflect the superiority of the socialist system. Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "To prove that socialism is truly superior to capitalism, we need to wait for the third step, it is still premature to boast about it." With China's large population, if by the middle of the 21st century, the population reaches 1.5 billion and the per capita income reaches $4,000, the annual GDP will reach $6 trillion, greatly surpassing the United States' $4.97 trillion GDP in 1987. "This not only provides a way out for the three-quarters of the world's population in the Third World but, more importantly, it demonstrates to humanity that socialism is the only way and socialism is superior to capitalism."
The "three-step" economic development strategy goals constitute an important part of the construction of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is a specific implementation plan and fundamental embodiment of the central task of socialist modernization construction. Some major principles and policy guidelines for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics revolve around and serve this development strategy. This development strategy points the direction for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the primary stage of socialism. It can be foreseen that as long as we continue to follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the development strategy goals of Deng Xiaoping's designed "three-step" modernization construction will definitely be achieved.
III. Further clarification of the goals of political system reform
With the deepening development of economic system reform, the task of political system reform has become more urgent on the party's agenda. The task of political system reform has attracted attention as early as around the 11th Plenary Session. In 1980, in his speech on "Reform of the Party and State Leadership System" at the expanded meeting of the Central Political Bureau, Deng Xiaoping solemnly put forward the major task of political system reform. The central government was ready to gradually implement political system reform from then on, but due to various reasons, political system reform was not fully implemented until 1986.
1. Deep understanding of the importance and urgency of promoting political system reform
With the development of the situation, political system reform has inevitably come back on the agenda. On June 10, 1986, when Deng Xiaoping listened to the report on the current economic situation by responsible comrades at the central level, he explicitly pointed out: It seems now that without political system reform, we cannot adapt to the situation. Reform should include the reform of the political system, and it should be considered as a sign of progress in the reform. Deng Xiaoping also emphasized that all comrades, especially the members of the Central Secretariat, should consider the issue of political system reform and find someone to figure it out and get things in order. He requested that before the 13th National Congress, the party-government relationship should be straightened out, the content of political system reform should be clarified, and a blueprint for political system reform should be formulated.
Deng Xiaoping's series of ideas laid the foundation for the discussion and design of the framework for political system reform. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in 1986 to establish the Central Political System Research Group. The group consisted of five people, including members of the Central Secretariat, the Central Advisory Committee, the State Council, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and conducted research under the direct leadership of the Political Bureau Standing Committee.
The Central Political System Reform Discussion Group organized practical workers from relevant departments and theoretical workers from various fields, and established seven thematic groups to conduct specialized discussions and demonstrations on topics such as the separation of party and government, intra-party democracy, institutional reform, personnel system reform, socialist democracy, socialist legal system construction, and the basic principles of reform. At the same time, the Central Political System Reform Discussion Group requested that the Central Party School also establish a discussion group to conduct in-depth investigations and research parallel to the above-mentioned thematic groups, extensively solicit opinions from the CPPCC, mass organizations, and other parties, carefully study the historical experience of the political system since the establishment of the new China, especially the practical experience of reform since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and combine with the actual situation of our country to study and draw on the experience of foreign political system structures and operations, and to submit research reports on each topic.
Based on the research reports on the topics proposed by the thematic groups and the absorption of research achievements from the theoretical community, the Central Political System Reform Discussion Group gradually developed a general plan for political system reform. This plan, with the consent of the Central Political Bureau, was submitted to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee in October 1987. After full discussion, the plenary session agreed in principle to the "General Plan for Political System Reform" and decided to include the basic content of the plan in the report of the Central Committee to the Thirteenth National Congress and submit it for discussion at the congress.
The report of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party, based on the actual conditions of the primary stage of socialism and the needs of socialist modernization construction in our country, on the basis of a profound analysis of the necessity and urgency of political system reform, expounds the goals, tasks, and principles to be grasped in the reform, and puts forward a blueprint for political system reform in our country.
2. Planning the Goals of Political System Reform
The Thirteenth National Congress divides the goals of political system reform into long-term goals and short-term goals. The long-term goal of political system reform stipulated by the Thirteenth National Congress is to establish a highly democratic, comprehensive legal, efficient, and vibrant socialist political system. The short-term goal is to establish a leadership system that is conducive to improving efficiency, enhancing vitality, and mobilizing initiatives from all sides. Regarding the main content of the reform, the Thirteenth National Congress proposed reforms in seven areas in the short term:
First, to achieve the separation of party and government and strengthen the institutional building of the party. The key to political system reform is the separation of party and government. The leadership of the party is political leadership, which means leading and recommending important cadres to the state power organs in terms of political principles, political orientation, and major decisions. The main way for the party to exercise political leadership in state affairs is to turn the party's propositions into national will through legal procedures, and to promote the party's line, principles, and policies through the activities of party organizations and the exemplary role of party members, thus achieving the expected goals. In order to achieve the separation of party and government, the party's organizational form and working institutions must be adjusted, the institutional building of the party must be strengthened, and the party's understanding of achieving the separation of party and government must be improved. Only in this way can the expected goals be achieved.
Second, further decentralize power. The phenomenon of excessive concentration of power is not only manifested in the excessive concentration of power in the administrative, economic, cultural organizations, and mass organizations in the party's leading organs, but also in the excessive concentration of power at the grassroots level in the higher-level leading organs. This not only traps the leading organs in dilemmas of formalism and unable to extricate themselves, but also deprives the grassroots of autonomy, making it difficult to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people. The Thirteenth National Congress established the overall principle of decentralizing power, which is that anything suitable for lower-level handling should be decided and executed by the lower-level authorities.
Third, reform government institutions. The government's bloated and oversized institutions, excessive layers, unclear responsibilities, and mutual buck-passing are important reasons for the formation of bureaucracy. Reform of government institutions must be implemented from top to bottom. The principles of reform are streamlining, unification, and efficiency. The Thirteenth Congress proposes that the State Council should immediately begin to formulate a plan to reform the central government institutions, and after approval by the Seventh National People's Congress, it should be implemented.
Fourth, reform the cadre personnel system. The focus of the reform is to establish a national civil servant system, that is, to formulate laws and regulations to scientifically manage personnel in the government who exercise national administrative power and perform national duties in accordance with the law. At the same time, according to the principle of separating the Party and the government, separating the government from enterprises, and closely integrating the management of people and affairs, personnel of all kinds should be classified and managed. The main categories are: leaders and staff of Party organizations and government agencies, managed by Party committees at all levels; leaders and staff of state power institutions, judicial institutions, and procuratorial institutions, managed by a system similar to national civil servants; leaders and staff of mass organizations and managers of enterprises and institutions, generally managed by their respective organizations or units according to their own constitutions or regulations.
Fifth, establish a system of consultation and dialogue. The system of consultation and dialogue is not only conducive to the correct handling and coordination of various social interests and contradictions, but also conducive to ensuring that the work of various levels of leadership is based on listening to public opinions, accepting supervision, and avoiding mistakes. The basic principles of establishing a system of consultation and dialogue are: carry forward the fine tradition of "coming from the masses and returning to the masses", improve the openness of activities of leadership organs, let the people know about major situations, and discuss major issues with the people.
Sixth, improve several systems of socialist democratic politics. These systems include: strengthening the system of people's congresses; improving the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party; strengthening the construction of mass organizations; improving the electoral system; strengthening the institutionalized construction of grassroots democratic life; further improving the system of regional national autonomy.
Seventh, strengthen the construction of socialist legal system. Every aspect of the country's political life, economic life, and social life, as well as every link of democracy and dictatorship, should have laws to rely on, laws must be followed, law enforcement must be strict, and violations of the law must be prosecuted.
Starting from the blueprint of political system reform proposed by the Thirteenth Congress of the Communist Party of China, the reform of the political system in our country has gradually entered a stage of goal-oriented and step-by-step supporting reforms after being implemented in a local scope.
On November 14, 1987, the new Central Political Bureau held its first plenary meeting, discussing and passing the "Working Rules of the Thirteenth Central Political Bureau (Trial)", "Working Rules of the Thirteenth Central Political Bureau Standing Committee (Trial)", and "Working Rules of the Thirteenth Central Secretariat (Trial)". These three rules, along with the subsequent working rules of the State Council, further clarified the relationship between the Central Political Bureau, its Standing Committee, the Central Secretariat, and the Central Plenum, with the Central Secretariat serving as an executive agency rather than having decision-making powers. The Central Political Bureau Standing Committee regularly reports its work to the Central Political Bureau, and the Central Political Bureau regularly reports its work to the Central Plenum. The frequency of the Central Plenum has also increased from once a year to twice a year. At the same time, it also clarified the functions, scope of work, and working methods of the Party Central Committee and the central People's Government, forming a reasonable framework in accordance with the requirements of separating Party and government functions, providing initial regulations. This is an important step in the construction of intra-Party and national democracy.
At the same time, the party began to implement the system of differential elections. According to the method of differential elections stipulated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 20% of the delegates to the 13th Party Congress, 5% of the Central Committee members, and 12% of the alternate Central Committee members were elected differentially. The results of the election at the 13th Party Congress were that 10 candidates for Central Committee member were not elected, there were 16 alternate Central Committee members, and 4 members of the Disciplinary Commission were not pre-selected. At the provincial level, the differential election has been implemented in the selection of provincial party committee standing committee members, chairpersons and vice chairpersons of provincial, autonomous region, and directly administered municipal standing committees, governors and vice governors. In the provincial-level elections after the 13th Party Congress, the chairpersons of the standing committees of the people's congresses of 11 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, and the governors and chairpersons of 8 provinces and autonomous regions were elected through differential elections. A total of 99 candidates recommended by the people's congresses of 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities were listed as official candidates, and 12 were elected, including 4 chairpersons of the standing committees, 2 vice chairpersons, 5 vice governors, and 1 chief judge of a high-level court. This is unprecedented in the history of the people's power elections since the founding of New China, and it has caused a strong reaction in China's political life.
In accordance with the requirements of separating the functions of the Party and the government and improving the principle of Party leadership, the central organs directly under the Party underwent reforms in 1988. There were originally 26 working institutions and institutions directly under the Party Central Committee, and in the reform, 8 were abolished, 3 were restructured, and 15 were retained, with 5 new ones established. After the adjustment, there were a total of 23 working institutions and institutions directly under the Party Central Committee. During the reform, attention was paid to distinguishing the responsibilities of the Party's work departments and the administrative departments, straightening out the relationship between the Party's work institutions and government institutions, transferring work that should be undertaken by government departments to relevant government departments, and no longer setting up leadership groups and offices that overlap with Party Central Committee and State Council departments. Each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality has formulated some rules accordingly, and has carried out reforms in terms of specific organizational forms and methods of work. Party committees generally do not have full-time secretaries in charge of government work, abolished the departments responsible for counterpart work in the Party committee offices, streamlined Party committee institutions, and reduced full-time cadres.
In enterprises, according to the "Draft Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises with the Entire People's Ownership System" adopted at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress, enterprises implement the system of responsibility by the factory director (manager), with the factory director serving as the legal representative of the enterprise, occupying a central position in the enterprise, and leading the production, operation, and management of the enterprise, with overall responsibility for the material and spiritual civilization construction of the enterprise. The grassroots organizations of the Communist Party of China in enterprises ensure supervision of the implementation of the Party's and the state's policies and guidelines in the enterprise. These provide a legal basis for separating the functions of the Party and the government in enterprises. After the implementation of the Enterprise Law, the system of responsibility by the factory director (manager) and the separation of Party and government functions have been widely implemented in enterprises, forming the basic pattern.
3. Initiation of government institutional reform and personnel system reform
According to the political system reform blueprint designed at the 13th Party Congress, government institutional reform and personnel system reform were put on the agenda. The first session of the Seventh National People's Congress held from March 25 to April 14, 1988, approved the "State Council Institutional Reform Plan." In his report on government work, Li Peng expounded the goals, principles, and priorities of government institutional reform. He stated: The long-term goal of government institutional reform is to gradually establish an administrative management system with complete functions, reasonable structure, coordinated operation, and flexible and efficient efficiency based on the principles of separating the Party and the government, separating politics and enterprises, and streamlining, unifying, and enhancing efficiency with Chinese characteristics. Achieving this goal requires long-term efforts. In the next five years, efforts should be made to create conditions to gradually straighten out the relationship between the government and enterprises, people's organizations, the relationship between government departments, and the relationship between the central government and local governments.
The "State Council Institutional Reform Plan" determines that 12 ministries and commissions will be abolished at the ministerial level, 9 new ministries and commissions will be established, and 32 will be retained, reducing the total number from the original 45 to 41. Xinhua News Agency will be transformed into a public institution. In addition, the number of central government institutions will be reduced from 22 to 19, the number of administrative agencies will be increased from 4 to 7, the number of national bureaus managed by various ministries and commissions will be increased from 14 to 15, and the number of non-specialized institutions will be reduced from 77 to 44. The reduction in personnel will be about 20%.
The biggest difference between the State Council's institutional reform this time and the reform in 1982 is that it is based on the requirements of political and economic system reforms, with the transformation of functions as the key, and it is coordinated with the internal institutional construction of the government and preparatory work for the implementation of the national civil service system. In terms of approach, the key is to focus on the transformation of functions, decompose functions according to the principle of separating government and enterprises, transfer functions of directly managing enterprises, delegate functions of directly managing money and goods, and strengthen the functions of decision-making, consultation, regulation, supervision, and information management that belong to the central government. At the same time, it also strengthens the social management functions that were originally undertaken by party departments but should be undertaken by government departments. Based on this, institutions are set up and personnel establishment is determined according to the new functions. Based on the functions, departments that undertake the same or similar businesses are abolished and the business is assumed by one department; general economic departments generally do not have specialized institutions in charge, and industry management work is undertaken by competent departments; only two levels of divisions and offices are set up within ministries and commissions to reduce the management levels within departments. This institutional reform of the State Council has promoted the transformation of the government's management of enterprises from direct management to indirect management, and it has made significant progress in reducing the cross-functionality and overlap of work and enhancing the vitality and efficiency of institutions, laying a good foundation for further reforms and local institutional reforms.
The reform of central government institutions also requires corresponding links to local reforms. Therefore, the State Council Institutional Reform Office began preparations in August 1988. Prior to this, the pilot work of local institutional reform had been conducted in 16 medium-sized cities in May 1986. In 1989, with the approval of the State Council, Harbin, Qingdao, Wuhan, Shenzhen, and other four planned sub-provincial cities, Jicheng, Shanxi Yuangping, Zhuozi Mountain, Shangyu in Zhejiang, Huaxian in Henan, Huarong in Hunan, Bao'an in Guangdong, Qionglai in Sichuan, Dingxi in Gansu, and other 9 counties conducted institutional reform pilots. After gaining experience through pilot projects at different levels and types, the pilot was expanded in 1991. After the pilot projects, the pilot units not only achieved certain results in institutional reform, but also further clarified the ideas for local institutional reform. Based on the pilot experience, the State Council plans to gradually promote local institutional reform, with the basic idea of starting from straightening out relationships and transforming functions, including straightening out the relationship between the central and local governments, and the relationships between local governments at all levels; rationalize the division of powers, and transform the functions of local governments at all levels in accordance with the requirements of separating government and enterprises; and then strive to achieve the scientificization of the administrative decision-making system, improve the administrative execution system, and rationalize the administrative supervision system, and improve the operational mechanism of administrative management.
Establishing the national civil service system is the focus of personnel and personnel system reforms determined at the Thirteenth National Congress. According to the Thirteenth National Congress's deployment, the state established the Ministry of Personnel as the management institution for national civil servants. After the establishment of the Ministry of Personnel, on the one hand, it began to formulate regulations on the management of national civil servants, and at the same time, it conducted pilot projects in six departments, including the Auditor General's Office, the General Administration of Customs, the National Bureau of Statistics, the State Taxation Administration, the State Building Materials Bureau, and the State Environmental Protection Bureau. In 1991, Harbin and Shenzhen were selected for the pilot projects of the local civil service system. The pilot projects in the six departments of the State Council initially started with the classification of positions. The determination of government functions is the basis for setting up institutions and the prerequisite for establishing a civil service system. In the past, unclear functions resulted in improper allocation of positions to individuals, but now that the functions are clear, positions can be allocated based on qualifications, which is undoubtedly a significant advancement. These six departments began the pilot position classification in April 1989, based on the "Three Fixes" plan, and by the end of June 1990, they completed the investigation, analysis, evaluation, and formulation of position classification standards, position levels, and other work for a total of 2618 positions.
Another important aspect of the civil service system is the examination, recruitment, and training system for civil servants. From 1987 to 1988, a method of provincial examination and recruitment was adopted for the recruitment of civil servants in 13 departments such as politics, law, industry and commerce, and taxation. Over 1 million people nationwide applied to take the exam, and over 80,000 were recruited. In January 1989, the Central Organization Department and the National Ministry of Human Resources issued a notice on the examination and assessment methods for the recruitment of staff in national administrative agencies. It required that the examination and assessment methods be implemented for the recruitment of staff in administrative agencies at the county level and above. The procedures include: announcement, qualification review, written test, interview, medical examination, assessment, and recruitment. The examination system has a history in China. The imperial examination system that was formed over thousands of years is the main way to select officials in China. The examination and recruitment system for civil servants is definitely not a revival of the traditional imperial examination system, but a necessary reform of the previous cadre selection system to meet the needs of modern social life. This method, which is oriented towards society, open for examination, and recruits based on merit, has had a positive impact on implementing the principle of competition, strengthening democratic supervision, preventing corruption in personnel matters, and ensuring the quality of recruited personnel.
Reform of personnel systems in enterprises and institutions has also made significant progress. In May 1988, the Central Organization Department and the Ministry of Human Resources formulated the "Several Opinions on the Reform of the Personnel System in State-owned Enterprises to Introduce Competitive Mechanisms and Management of Cadres" and required the introduction of competitive mechanisms into personnel management in state-owned enterprises and the selection of enterprise managers through open bidding. Various forms of appointment system, hierarchical appointment, and selection based on merit should also be implemented for the appointment of internal managerial staff at all levels of enterprises. Enterprises have the right to appoint and dismiss, and individuals have the right to be appointed and resign. In 1991, the Central Organization Department and the Ministry of Human Resources issued the "Interim Regulations on the Appointment Management of Cadres under State-owned Enterprises", which unified the regulations on appointment, transfer, retirement, and benefits, further improving the cadre appointment system within enterprises.
By the end of 1990, there were already 1.7 million appointed cadres in state-owned enterprises, with over 90% of them being recruited from workers. Practice has proven that the implementation of the appointment system for cadre in enterprises has been relatively successful. Therefore, many institutions have also adopted similar methods of bidding and appointing cadre leaders within their own organizations. The professional and technical appointment system is widely implemented among scientific and technological cadres.
IV. Taking the path of strengthening the Party's construction through institutional development
Whether China's reform and modernization can achieve the expected goals depends on various factors, but one of the most important factors is the condition of the Communist Party of China as the governing party. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, while leading the reform and economic development, the Communist Party of China has firmly grasped the key link of strengthening its own construction and gradually embarked on a new path of strengthening the Party through institutional development, while strengthening ideological and political construction. 
1. Completion of a new round of Party consolidation work
Already at the time of the Twelfth National Congress, the Party Central Committee decided to conduct a comprehensive rectification of the Party's style and organization in stages and batches over a period of three years starting in the second half of 1983.
The 2nd Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was held in Beijing from October 11th to 12th, 1983. Based on the decision of the 12th National Congress of the CPC, the plenary session made arrangements for the comprehensive Party rectification work. The session adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Party Rectification" (referred to as the "Decision"). The "Decision" analyzed the necessity and urgency of the Party rectification, proposed the overall objectives and requirements of the rectification, which is to, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the revolutionary consciousness of all Party comrades, correctly use the sharp weapon of criticism and self-criticism, enforce Party discipline, expose and resolve serious ideological, work style, and organizational impurities within the Party, achieve fundamental improvement in Party conduct, raise the ideological and work levels of the entire Party, strengthen the connection between the Party and the people, and strive to build the Party into a strong core leading the socialist modernization cause.
The "Decision" clearly stipulates that the task of this Party rectification is to unify thinking, rectify work style, strengthen discipline, and purify the organization, and provides specific explanations for these:
Unifying thinking means further achieving a high degree of ideological and political unity within the Party, correcting all "left" and "right" incorrect tendencies that violate the four cardinal principles and the Party's line since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee.
Rectifying work style means promoting the revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, correcting all acts of seeking personal gain through abuse of power, and opposing irresponsible bureaucratism towards the Party and the people.
Strengthening discipline means adhering to the organizational principles of democratic centralism, opposing disorganized and undisciplined paternalism, factionalism, anarchism, and liberalism, and changing the Party's weak and lax organizational conditions.
Purifying the organization means, in accordance with the Party's Constitution, cleaning out those elements that persistently oppose the Party and harm the Party.
The "Decision" stipulates that the steps of the Party rectification are to be carried out from the central to grassroots Party organizations, from top to bottom and in stages. The rectification of each Party organization should also be carried out from top to bottom, first rectifying the leadership team and leading cadres, and then rectifying the Party members and masses. The basic method of Party rectification is: on the basis of earnestly studying documents and improving ideological understanding, carry out criticism and self-criticism, distinguish right from wrong, correct mistakes, and purify the organization. Throughout the Party rectification process, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education from start to finish, with a focus on raising the ideological awareness of the majority of Party members. The "Decision" announced the establishment of the Central Committee Work Guidance Commission for Party Rectification.
According to the Party rectification decision and the deployment of the CPC Central Committee's Work Guidance Commission for Party Rectification, the comprehensive Party rectification is actually carried out in three stages.
The first stage is carried out in central and state organs, ministries and commissions, and at the provincial, autonomous regional, and directly-administered municipal level, as well as in major units of the People's Liberation Army. In order to strengthen the leadership of the first stage of the Party rectification, the Central Committee's Work Guidance Commission and the Central Military Commission dispatched 90 Party rectification liaison groups consisting of 850 personnel, and established ten Party rectification work guidance groups for central and state organs. During this period, the Central Committee's Work Guidance Commission issued 11 notifications and other documents. These documents provided specific instructions on the study of Party rectification-related documents, fully listening to the opinions of non-Party friends and the masses, forming two sets of work teams for Party rectification and routine work, conducting comparative checks, carrying out simultaneous rectification and improvement, organizing disciplinary actions and Party member registration, conducting inspections, summarizing and consolidating the Party rectification, and so on. They not only timely guided the work of various stages of the first stage of the Party rectification but also played an important role in all stages of the Party rectification work.
The second phase of the party consolidation work was carried out in the party organizations at the local, county, and corresponding levels of enterprises, institutions, colleges, and research institutes. From February 28 to March 6, 1985, the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee held the second phase of the party consolidation work meeting and deployed the second phase of the consolidation. In response to the various disruptive forces affecting construction and reform within the party and society at that time, the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee emphasized in its notification the need to enhance party members' party spirit, rectify the new improper practices, ensure the smooth progress of reform, and promote the continued healthy development of the political and economic situation. This was highlighted as the key focus of the consolidation work at the local and county levels. In order to grasp the basic situation of the second phase of the consolidation work in various regions, the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee sent out seven inspection teams to investigate, identify problems, summarize experiences, and make recommendations.
The third phase was carried out in grassroots party organizations in rural areas. On November 24, 1985, the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee issued a notification on the deployment of the consolidation work in rural areas, providing comprehensive arrangements for the specific requirements, methods, and steps of the work. Each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government sent out 630,000 speakers and liaison officers to help with the consolidation work in rural areas. From May to June 1986, the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee held symposiums on the consolidation work with the provincial party committee secretaries, clarifying the fundamental guiding ideology for the consolidation work in rural areas and emphasizing the need to seriously address and effectively strengthen the construction of leadership teams in rural areas, while focusing on tackling the serious issues of abuse of power for personal gain and serious violations of laws and discipline among party members and cadres at the district, township, and village levels.
The nationwide consolidation work, which lasted for three and a half years, was basically completed in the spring of 1987. On May 26, Bo Yibo, the Executive Deputy Director of the Central Party Consolidation Guidance Committee, delivered a report entitled "Basic Summary of the Consolidation Work and Further Strengthening Party Building," providing an overall assessment of the consolidation work. In summarizing the achievements in various aspects of the consolidation work, Bo Yibo specifically pointed out the following:
The main achievements in unifying thinking are as follows: (1) From senior cadres to the broader party members, through careful and relatively systematic study of the consolidation documents, many vague understandings have been clarified, and a deeper understanding of the socialist path with Chinese characteristics since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party has been achieved. It has been made clear that adhering to reform, opening up, revitalizing the economy, and vigorously developing a planned socialist market economy is the only way to build a strong, democratic, and civilized socialist country. Furthermore, it has further increased the awareness of party members in implementing and carrying out these Marxist policies. (2) By carrying out thorough education to completely negate the "Cultural Revolution," the majority of party members have clearly recognized that both factions during the "Cultural Revolution" were operating under the misguided theoretical guidance of "class struggle as the key link" and "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat," and overall, they were mistaken. This has promoted the further elimination of factionalism and the negative influence of the "left," laying a more solid ideological and political foundation for enhancing party unity and inspiring party members' innovation and reform spirits. (3) Through widespread education on party spirit, ideals, and purposes, the situation of some party members having a weak understanding of communist ideals and the concept of serving the people has been changed. This has resulted in an increase in ideological consciousness among the majority of party members and enhanced their ability to resist the erosion of capitalist and feudal thoughts.
The progress made in rectifying work style is mainly as follows: (1) Efforts have been made in various regions to investigate and handle cases of party members seriously violating laws and discipline, abusing power for personal gain, and being irresponsible. This has basically curbed the new improper practices of party and government cadres managing enterprises, and there has been varying degrees of improvement in party conduct. (2) The transformation of the work style of leadership organs at all levels has been promoted, leading to a reduction in bureaucratic tendencies and the strengthening of the idea of serving grassroots levels. In many regions and departments, party members in leadership positions have taken the lead in going to grassroots levels, conducting investigations and research, solving practical problems in construction, reform, and people's livelihood, and strengthening the relationship between the party and the people. (3) In the process of rectifying the Party in rural areas, efforts were made to clean up the financial work. Party members and cadres took the lead in returning long-overdue public funds and property, and took the lead in serving the people, which was welcomed by the rural masses.
The main achievements in strengthening discipline and purifying the organization are as follows: (1) Efforts were made to clean up the "Three Types of People" and those who committed serious mistakes during the Cultural Revolution. Party organizations at all levels invested a lot of energy in participating in special Party rectification checks. Comrades who participated in these checks overcame various difficulties and resistance, and conducted many arduous investigation and evidence gathering tasks. On the basis of the previous cleaning and handling of 400,000 people, a total of 5,449 "Three Types of People" and 43,074 people who committed serious mistakes were identified nationwide (excluding the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region). (2) Criticism and self-criticism and the strict organization life in the Party have been restored and carried forward. Party members' awareness of organizational discipline has been strengthened compared to before. Some Party organizations that were previously paralyzed or partially paralyzed have shown significant improvement after rectification. (3) A group of party members with serious problems and unqualified status were dealt with through party member registration and organizational handling. A total of 33,896 people were expelled from the Party, 90,069 people were not registered, and 145,456 people were temporarily registered. In addition, 184,071 people received disciplinary actions such as being put under Party probation, revocation of Party positions, recommendation for revocation of positions outside the Party, serious warnings, and warnings. (4) Adjustments were made to a group of leadership teams with problems and weaknesses. About half of the leadership teams at the county level and above were supplemented to varying degrees. Through adjustments and supplementation, the construction of leadership teams was promoted. A group of outstanding young and middle-aged party members with strong party spirit, upright conduct, and the ability to lead the masses in resolutely implementing the Party's current policies have taken up leadership positions at all levels.
The most important significance of this Party rectification work in the history of Party building is to clean up the "Three Types of People" (referring to those who rose to power by following the counter-revolutionary Lin Biao and Jiang Qing factions during the Cultural Revolution, those with serious gangster tendencies, and those who engaged in looting, smashing, and robbery) hidden within Party organizations at all levels. This has eliminated hidden dangers that affect Party unity and interfere with Party construction, and purified the Party's organization.
Of course, while achieving results, there are also some shortcomings in this Party rectification work. The development of the work is unbalanced, and some units, including some higher and intermediate Party and government leadership organs, have not fully completed the four basic tasks of Party rectification, and some have even gone through the motions, which has affected and damaged the reputation of Party rectification among the masses. Units that have handled the Party rectification relatively well still have some problems in terms of Party conduct and other aspects, which need to be addressed in the future regular Party building.
2. The advent of a new stage in the construction of the Party's cadre team
Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "Once the political line is determined, the cadre is the determining factor." Mao Zedong attached the greatest importance to the cultivation of the Party's cadre team. Chen Yun once said that from the Zunyi Conference to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mao Zedong's incomparable achievement was the cultivation of a generation of people, including us and a group of cadres known as the "March 8th Style".
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the second generation of central leadership collective with Deng Xiaoping as the core gradually found the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, formed a set of correct principles, policies, and opened up a new situation in socialist modernization construction. Deng Xiaoping did not indulge in this, but extended the scope of thinking deeper and further, that is, how to ensure the succession of the cause created by the older generation of revolutionaries.
As early as August 18, 1980, when Deng Xiaoping spoke at an expanded meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, he first proposed the "Four Mordernizations" for cadres. On December 25 of the same year, Deng Xiaoping clearly stated the "Four Modernizations" criteria for cadres under the theme of "Implementing the Adjustment Policy and Ensuring Stability and Unity" at the central working conference. He said: In order to make our cadre team younger, more knowledgeable, and more professional under the premise of adhering to the socialist path, we must gradually establish and improve the cadre system to ensure this. The three conditions of youthfulness, knowledgeability, and specialization are proposed, and of course, the first requirement is to be revolutionary, so it is necessary to adhere to the socialist path.
On July 2, 1981, Deng Xiaoping delivered a speech at the symposium of provincial, autonomous region, and directly governed municipality party secretaries, entitled "The primary task of the elderly cadres is to select young and middle-aged cadres." After analyzing the importance of promoting young and middle-aged cadres, he proposed to establish goals and plans for training and selecting these cadres. He said: I suggest, comrades, let's discuss it, shall we propose a five-year plan? It'd be best to make it four years, lasting until 1985. Regarding cadre issues, I suggest making two plans: a five-year plan and a ten-year plan. In the first five years, let's select, for example, 50,000 people and place them in suitable positions for training. During these five years, we should gradually have a certain proportion of our leadership members, members at the division level, members at the provincial, autonomous region, and directly governed municipality level who are around 50 years old or 40 years old. In the second five years, what level of leadership members (such as the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region level or ministerial level) do we want to attain, except for special circumstances, and what is the age limit?
At the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Deng Xiaoping delivered the opening speech. He placed the "four modernizations" of the cadre team as the top priority of the current work. At this representative conference, the goals of "revolutionization, youthfulness, knowledgeability, and specialization" were written into the newly passed Party Constitution.
The construction of the "four modernizations" of the cadre team is the concrete application of the principle of being both morally and intellectually qualified, and being both red and specialized, in the construction of the cadre team, reflecting the objective requirements of China's socialist modernization construction. Revolutionization means that cadres must adhere to the political and ideological lines since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, practice Party spirit, not factionalism, adhere to the socialist path, and have a strong sense of mission and responsibility. Youthfulness, under the precondition of revolutionization, is to select a large number of outstanding young and middle-aged cadres for various levels of leadership positions, so that the cadre structure of the Party and the state at all levels is energetic and maintains strong vitality. Knowledgeability and specialization require leaders to have a certain level of cultural education and knowledge, and be able to grasp and apply modern natural science, social science, and management science knowledge, in order to scientifically lead and manage socialist modernization construction. This fundamentally changes the trend of emphasizing family background, length of party membership, and seniority in the selection criteria for leadership cadres in the past.
To achieve the "four modernizations" of the cadre team, it is necessary to abolish the lifetime tenure system for leadership cadres. This is a key issue and also a difficult point. In this regard, the Party and the state have adopted the following four measures to abolish the lifetime tenure system for cadres:
First, establish a term-based system for cadre positions. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, passed at the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress, abolished the lifetime tenure system for cadre positions as the fundamental law of the country. The Constitution stipulates that the term of office for various highest state leadership positions is five years, and consecutive re-elections shall not exceed two terms.
Second, establishing a retirement system for cadres. In 1982, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on establishing a retirement system for cadres, which stipulated that main leading comrades holding ministerial-level positions in central and state organs and at the provincial level should retire at the age of 65 for principals and 60 for deputy principals, and cadres at the departmental level generally should not exceed the age of 60. If some individuals have health problems before reaching retirement age, they can retire early. After retirement, the political treatment of the cadres remains unchanged. According to the spirit of this document, by the end of 1982, more than 7,260 senior cadres from the directly affiliated institutions of the Central Committee and the central state organs had completed the retirement procedures. In August 1982, at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Bocheng and Cai Chang stepped down from leadership positions. In September 1985, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, 64 senior comrades, including Ye Jianying, Deng Yingchao, Xu Xiangqian, and Nie Rongzhen, requested to no longer hold positions as members and alternate members of the Central Committee; 37 senior comrades, including Li Jingquan, Xiao Jingguang, and He Changgong, requested to no longer serve as members of the Central Advisory Commission; and 30 senior comrades, including Huang Kecheng and Wang Congwu, requested to no longer serve as members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
Deng Xiaoping, who advocates abolishing the lifetime leadership system, has long wanted to gradually disappear from the political stage. He realizes that having too much prestige is a burden for himself and having too much personal weight is also a burden for the party and the country. It is abnormal and dangerous for a country's fate to rely on the reputation of one or two individuals, as many countries place their policy towards China on whether he is sick or dead. If any changes occur to that person, instability will arise. If nothing happens, it's fine, but once an incident occurs, it will be uncontrollable. Deng Xiaoping does not want such a situation to appear behind him. Therefore, as early as November 2, 1979, he said at a senior cadres meeting, "I have this idea myself. If the party allows me to retire today, I'll retire immediately." This is not a false statement, it is true.
On September 2, 1986, when meeting with American journalist Mike Wallace, Deng Xiaoping said: "I advocate abolishing the lifetime system and also advocate establishing a retirement system. You also know that when I talked to Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, I said I would be fine if I worked until 1985, but it's been over a year now. I am considering when to retire. Personally, I hope to retire early."
In 1987, before the convening of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Deng Xiaoping officially expressed his desire to retire in order to actively abolish the lifetime leadership system for cadres. At this time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China repeatedly considered Deng Xiaoping's personal wishes and the opinions within and outside the party, and decided to allow him to retain the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission while agreeing to resign from other positions. Thereafter, he no longer participated in the daily work of the central government, achieving a semi-retirement status.
The third measure is to reduce the number of deputy positions and part-time positions. In August 1980, Hua Guofeng no longer served as the Premier of the State Council, and Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, Wang Zhen, and Wang Renzhong no longer served as vice premier. In 1982, during the central and State Council institutional reform, the number of deputy positions was reduced. The number of vice premiers of the State Council was reduced from 13 to 2. According to statistics from 38 ministries and commissions, excluding ministers and directors who hold part-time positions, there are a total of 167 deputy ministers and deputy directors, which is a decrease of 338 people, or 67%, compared to the original 505 people; their average age is 58 years old, a decrease of 6 years; the proportion of cadres with a university education has increased from 37% to 52%. According to statistics from 28 ministries and commissions, the original 720 agencies and bureaus were reduced to 488, a decrease of 32%; the number of directors and deputy directors was reduced from 2450 to 1398, a decrease of 43%; their average age was reduced from 59 to 54 years old; the proportion of cadres with a university education has increased from 36% to 49%.
The fourth measure is to establish the advisory system. Deng Xiaoping proposed the idea of establishing an advisory committee in 1981: in addition to the Central Committee, an advisory committee should be established to "accommodate some old comrades." Advisors do not hold current positions, so that positions can be given to young people. Being an advisor is also a kind of position, and its level is not lower than that of members of the same level party committee. This allows old comrades to move to this position and have a comparatively easier job. Of course, being an advisor is not just for consolation, but also serves the purpose of "passing on knowledge and experience." Deng Xiaoping's intention behind this is profound because China's leadership not only faces the problem of aging but also the issue of succession. Establishing the advisory system is a good way to address these two issues. The Central Advisory Committee was formally established in September 1982, and Deng Xiaoping was elected as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee.
The establishment of the Central Advisory Committee has made a historic contribution to ensuring the long-term stability of the Party and the country during this historical turning point. After its establishment, the Central Advisory Committee has provided effective assistance to the Party Central Committee in maintaining unity and social stability, promoting reform, opening up, and modernization.
Deng Xiaoping predicted that after another ten years, or at most fifteen years, the advisory committee should be abolished. The Central Advisory Committee lasted from 1982 to 1992, exactly ten years. In these ten years, there has been smooth cooperation and alternation between the new and old cadres of the Party. At the same time, as the members of the Advisory Committee have aged over the course of two terms, and as a transitional measure, their mission has been accomplished. In view of this, the Central Advisory Committee proposed to the 14th Party Congress that there should no longer be a Central Advisory Committee after the 14th Party Congress. After serious and full discussion, the CPC Central Committee decided not to establish a Central Advisory Committee and provincial, municipal, and autonomous region advisory committees.
The above measures have created favorable conditions for the selection of young cadres and the realization of the Party's "four modernizations" goals for the cadre team. Seizing this opportunity, the CPC Central Committee has accelerated the "four modernizations" construction of the cadre team.
From 1984 to 1985, there was a relatively centralized adjustment of leadership teams at all levels. During this year-long period, the central government and the State Council appointed a total of 47 new ministers, directors, and directors of directly affiliated bureaus. There were also 80 new deputy ministers, deputy directors, and deputy bureau chiefs, with nearly 100 young and middle-aged cadres being selected. Before the adjustment, the average age of the main leaders of the 81 departments under the State Council was 56.6 years old. After the adjustment, the average age decreased by 5 years, the proportion of those under 55 years old increased from 10% to 30%, and the proportion of those with a college education increased by 27.5% to reach 71%. During the same period, the average age of the members of the standing committee of the Party committees, the governors, presidents, and mayors of 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government decreased from 57 years old to 53 years old. The proportion of those under 55 years old reached 90% and the proportion with a college education increased to 80%. During the same period, the leadership teams of more than 3,000 large and medium-sized key enterprises in the country were adjusted, forming a stepped structure, with cadres in their forties becoming the main body. According to statistics from 2,900 of these enterprises, among the 18,000 leading cadres, 20% were under 40 years old, 63% were between 41 and 50 years old, and the average age was 45 years old. Those with a college education or above accounted for 74%, among which 89% of the factory directors had a college education or above, an increase of 40% compared to before the adjustment. Among the party secretaries, 81% had a college education or above, an increase of 70% compared to before the adjustment. In order to accelerate the rejuvenation of the cadres, the Party's National Congress was held in 1985. This was a conference that focused on solving the problem of rejuvenating the cadres. At this conference, 131 senior leaders with long experience withdrew from the main leadership positions of the Party, and 179 new leaders were elected. The newly elected central committee members, new ministers, and provincial party secretaries were generally in their fifties, and some were in their early forties. This was an unprecedented power metabolism in the history of the Communist Party of China. Deng Xiaoping said that this event is worth recording in the history of the Party.
In view of the fact that a considerable number of old cadres at all levels will gradually resign from their current positions for a period of time, if there is no necessary number of new people as reserves, there will be a disconnect. Therefore, the central government decided to establish a reserve cadres system, establish a reserve cadre team consisting mainly of outstanding young and middle-aged cadres under the age of 50, especially around the age of 40, and put them into practice for training. By achieving practical achievements, they will undergo further inspection by the organization and the masses, and those who achieve excellent political performance will be promptly promoted and used.
Through strengthening the "four modernizations" of the cadre team, our cadre team has begun to show a new face. Under the premise of revolutionization, a large number of young and middle-aged cadres have taken leadership positions, forming a team with a combination of youth, middle-aged, and older cadres. This cadre team is both experienced and vibrant, and its combat effectiveness and cohesion have been strengthened. Of course, the "four modernizations" construction of the cadre team is still a long and arduous task, and there is still much work to be done and many contradictions to overcome.
3. Correcting various unhealthy tendencies within the Party
Party conduct reflects the Party's spiritual demeanor, directly relates to the Party's image among the people, and affects the level of the Party's prestige among the people. Therefore, the Party Central Committee attached great importance to and has been making efforts to earnestly address various unhealthy tendencies that emerged during the process of reform and opening up.
First, party and government officials, as well as their children and spouses, are prohibited from engaging in business activities and participating in corrupt practices. After the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee, China shifted its focus from rural to urban areas and entered a phase of comprehensive reform. The country entered a new phase of economic growth, and commercial activities became prevalent nationwide. Some party and government organs, as well as officials, consciously or unconsciously became involved in these activities, becoming a peculiar phenomenon in economic life. Before the comprehensive rectification of companies in 1988, there were over 470,000 registered companies in China. Among these companies, there were centrally-controlled companies established by various party, government, and military departments, national-level mass organizations, "subsidiary companies" established by various regions, and "excess heat companies" established by retired cadres. A significant portion of these companies blurred the line between the government and businesses, engaged in profiteering through resale, and some officials abused their powers for corruption, embezzlement, speculation, bribery, and other illegal activities. This seriously disrupted clean governance and the establishment of a sound socialist economic order, exacerbated social inequalities, and affected social stability.
The CCP Central Committee has maintained a clear understanding of the situation regarding party and government officials engaging in business activities and the serious harms it brings. On December 3, 1984, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Decision on Strictly Prohibiting Party and Government Organs and Party Members from Engaging in Business and Establishing Enterprises," which clearly stated that party and government leadership at all levels, especially in economic departments, must correctly fulfill their duties in leading and organizing economic construction. They must adhere to the principle of separating responsibilities and separating the government from businesses, promote integrity, fairness, and uprightness, and strictly prohibit the use of power to engage in commercial activities, establish enterprises, seek personal gains, and compete with the people for profits. The central government required party and government leadership at all levels and officials to maintain a clear mind, take a firm stance, and resolutely eliminate corrupt practices.
However, after the prohibition of party and government organs and serving officials from engaging in business activities, new situations emerged. The participation of the children and spouses of some leading officials in business activities was unexpectedly fierce. After discovering this problem, on May 23, 1985, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Decision on Prohibiting the Children and Spouses of Leading Cadres from Engaging in Business," which stipulated that the children and spouses of cadres at or above county and division levels are strictly prohibited from engaging in business, except in state-owned, collective, and Sino-foreign joint ventures. On July 9 of the same year, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued the "Supplementary Notice on Party and Government Officials Not Concurrently Holding Positions in Economic Entities," which made relevant provisions.
For a period of time, most of the enterprises operated by party and government organs were shut down or dissociated from the party and government organs. Most party and government officials engaged in business activities returned to their positions or resigned from their leadership positions. However, the harmful practices persisted. Some party and government organs and officials employed various means to continue engaging in business activities, some officials continued to hold concurrent positions in enterprises, and family members took advantage of their relationships with leading officials to engage in business activities. Some serious illegal activities in business operations, particularly those involving certain leading officials, were not properly resolved.
In order to firmly put an end to the phenomenon of party and government organs and officials engaging in business activities, on February 4, 1986, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Regulations on Further Prohibiting Party and Government Organs and Officials from Engaging in Business and Establishing Enterprises," requiring all levels of party committees and governments to resolutely implement the central regulations and strictly enforce them. Those who refuse to comply should be sternly dealt with and held accountable for leadership responsibilities. The discipline inspection commissions at all levels and the administrative organs for industry and commerce should closely cooperate with the departments of organization, personnel, auditing, banks, judiciary, and others to supervise implementation.
By implementing the spirit of this document, the problem of party and government organs and officials engaging in business activities has been initially resolved.
Second, the investigation and prosecution of party and government officials involved in bribery and extortion.
In the process of prohibiting party and government officials from engaging in business activities and engaging in improper conduct, investigations were also conducted on the issue of bribery and corruption by party and government officials. When the commodity economy began to become active and administrative behavior, market behavior, and enterprise behavior had not yet been strictly regulated by legal forms, corrupt activities such as the exchange of power and money were most likely to breed and spread. In response to the new characteristics of party discipline and clean government construction in the new situation, on June 30, 1987, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued the "Decision on Resolutely Investigating the Issue of Bribery by Communist Party Members", pointing out that in recent years, in our foreign economic activities, feudal society and capitalist society have been commonplace. The ugly behavior of bribery and corruption has spread in some places and departments. This situation has aroused strong dissatisfaction from within and outside the party, both domestically and internationally. This must be given high attention by the whole party, and resolute measures must be taken to severely investigate and deal with acts of bribery and corruption. To this end, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has made three decisions: (1) Communist Party members, especially leading cadres, regardless of who they are, if they violate criminal laws due to bribery and corruption, they will be expelled from the party. Party members who take bribes must actively confess the problem by whatever means, otherwise, once discovered, regardless of the severity of the circumstances, they will be expelled from the party. (2) In the normal "kickbacks" in economic activities, no one is allowed to take them for themselves for any reason or excuse. They must all be turned over to the state or the collectives. Violators will be seriously dealt with according to party discipline and laws. (3) Party organizations at all levels, including disciplinary inspection agencies, must effectively strengthen the education, management, and supervision of party members, and never allow the party's principles to be traded. Party members with issues of bribery and corruption must be resolutely investigated. If they are tolerated and not dealt with, the leadership responsibilities of their party organizations should be pursued.
After a period of efforts, due to the strong measures, the improper conduct of bribery and corruption has basically been curbed, but it has not been completely eradicated, so the central authorities require the whole party to persistently fight against this corruption phenomenon.
Third, firmly curb the improper conduct of selecting and appointing cadres and cadres in overseas issues. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, great achievements were made in selecting and appointing cadres. However, there are also some problems, highlighted as follows: Some leading cadres do not abide by the party's principles, violate organizational and personnel disciplines, and some of them select and appoint people based on personal likes, dislikes, and personal gains, or select people based on feudal clan and sectarian views; Some people use various means to "backdoor" the promotion and appointment of children, relatives, and friends; some people use positions to give favors and engage in transactions; some people do not follow policy regulations, argue for the rank and treatment of cadres in their own systems or units, and upgrade their subordinate units; Some comrades who are responsible for organizational and personnel work abandon their duties, ignore principles, and even use their power for personal gain; and so on.
In order to curb the improper conduct of selecting and appointing cadres, on January 6, 1986, the CPC Central Committee put forward eight regulations for selecting and appointing cadres: (1) Leading cadres must modelly abide by the party's principles and maintain the discipline of organizational and personnel work. (2) The selection and appointment of cadres must strictly follow democratic recommendations, widely listen to opinions, propose selection targets; the organization and personnel departments conduct inspections, and after collective discussions by the Party Committee, they are reported according to the cadre management authority; further inspections are conducted by higher-level organizational departments, and then submitted to the Party Committee for discussion and approval. (3) The selection and appointment of leading cadres must fully take the mass line. (4) Before deciding on the promotion of cadres, strict inspections must be conducted according to the moral and intellectual conditions required by the proposed position. (5) The selection and appointment of cadres must be decided through collective discussions of the Party Committee, and individuals are not allowed to make final decisions. (6) The promotion of cadres should be based on comrades who have been tested and tempered in practice. (7) It is strictly prohibited to set up institutions, raise the level of institutions, and increase the number of leading cadres without authorization. (8) Organizational and personnel departments at all levels must earnestly fulfill their duties and serve as consultants and assistants to the Party Committee.
From early 1986, the Central Organization Department conducted extensive research and proposed some ideas and principles on the establishment of a system for party and government officials to abstain: first, abstention from taking office. Spouses, children, and relatives of cadres who hold leadership positions in the Party Committee, government, discipline inspection commission, public security, court, and procuratorate should not have direct hierarchical relationships with the leading cadres, and they should not hold leadership positions in the general office, organization, personnel, supervision department, and peer disciplinary inspection institutions of the leading cadres' organization. Second, abstention from official duties. Party and government leaders should not participate in various business activities related to their own appointment, file management, and transfer, nor should they instruct or indirectly influence others or intervene. In cases involving the appointment and adjustment of cadres, salary adjustments, party membership, assessment and appointment of professional and technical positions, handling of illegal and disciplinary cases, sending personnel abroad, recruitment, allocation of college and technical school graduates, and placement of military personnel, if it involves the relatives of leading cadres, the leading cadres themselves should actively explain to the organization and abstain from participating in inspections, investigations, discussions, and approvals, and should not instruct or indirectly influence others to intervene. The spouse, children, relatives, and staff members of the leading cadres should not participate in the official duties that should be abstained from in the name of the leading cadres or by taking advantage of work convenience. Third, abstention from regional issues. County (city) party secretaries, county (city) mayors, county (city) discipline inspection commission secretaries, organization department directors, personnel bureau directors, public security bureau directors, court presidents, and procurator generals should not be appointed by local cadres. If local cadres hold these positions, those who have served a full term cannot continue to be reappointed in the original region.
The unhealthy practices of cadres going abroad is a special form of corruption that emerged during China's reform and opening up process. Since the reform and opening up, the number of people going abroad for official and private purposes in China has increased significantly. However, there have also been unhealthy practices in terms of going abroad, mainly manifested in the excessive formation of groups of party and government officials going abroad, frequent repetitive inspections, rotation of overseas travel, and party and government officials replacing professional personnel for overseas travel, etc. Additionally, some party and government officials, under the pretext of inspections, engage in sightseeing and tourism abroad, which has led to increased foreign exchange expenditure and serious waste, causing adverse effects both domestically and internationally.
In order to curb this unhealthy trend, on July 4, 1987, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Several Provisions on Strictly Controlling the Issue of Party and Government Officials Going Abroad," stating that party and government officials who have no direct relationship with foreign missions and do not hold relevant business responsibilities shall not be allowed to go abroad under any pretext. Party and government officials should not participate in overseas missions that can be completed by professionals. Party and government organs and other officials in charge of business should not use hierarchical or work relationships as a reason to openly or implicitly demand participation in the overseas delegations of enterprises and institutions. Enterprises and institutions should also not invite party and government organs and other officials in charge of business departments without direct relevance to the overseas missions for the purpose of "consideration" or achieving certain goals. The regulations require local people's governments and central and state government departments with the power to approve foreign travel matters to conduct strict and serious examinations of overseas delegations based on relevant regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council. Those who do not meet the requirements should adhere to principles and not be approved. For those who have already been approved for going abroad, if problems that do not comply with the regulations are discovered before departure, the higher-level approving authority should promptly instruct the original approving authority to correct it, and if necessary, the case can be reviewed and approved again. After the issuance of this document, the unhealthy practices of cadres going abroad were initially curbed.
When the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is promoting the construction of party conduct and clean governance, it focuses on major cases to facilitate the improvement of party conduct.
In July 13, 1985, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued an open letter to the Jinjiang City Committee and Administrative Office Party Group regarding the large-scale production of counterfeit drugs by some enterprises in the Jinjiang area and their sale through various bribery methods. The letter demanded that they handle this case according to party discipline and laws and report to the central authorities. On July 27, after listening to the report from the Communist Party of China (CPC) Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) dealt with the individuals involved according to the law and decided to dismiss the Deputy Secretary of the Jinping County Committee and the Secretary of the County Discipline Inspection Commission who were involved in the production and sale of counterfeit drugs for personal gain.
From early 1986 to April 1989, a few leading cadres of the Ministry of Railways and the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau took advantage of their positions to embezzle and accept bribes by using various methods to seek personal gain through the allocation of railway carriages due to the inability of the railway transport capacity to meet the demand. After investigation, it was found that a total of 48 cadres above the rank of division Chief from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways were involved in this case, along with one Deputy Minister of Railways, 15 bureau-level cadres, and 19 department-level cadres. The amount of criminal funds was over 960,000 yuan. The Ministry of Railways Transportation Bureau illegally demanded and accepted various sums totaling over 760,000 yuan from shippers or lower-level units under various pretexts in violation of regulations. The CCDI dealt with this case seriously. The State Council removed Luo Yunguang, the Deputy Minister of Railways, from office for bribery and for being responsible for the bribery and corruption of his subordinates, and the procuratorial organs initiated an investigation against Luo Yunguang for bribery. The CCDI also decided to expel Xu Jun, the former director of the Ministry of Railways Transportation Bureau, Jia Shuang and Hu Jun, deputy directors of the bureau, Wei Guofan, executive assistant director of the bureau (department-level status), Ma Mingshan, dispatcher of the bureau (department-level status), He Zhigui, former director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, Liu Demin, Party Secretary of the bureau, and Pan Keming, deputy director of the bureau, revoking their party membership due to their violations of criminal laws. Their cases were to be examined by the judicial organs.
From May 6 to June 2, 1987, a major forest fire broke out in Daxing'anling, resulting in significant losses to national property and human lives, some of which could not be quantified in monetary terms. Yang Zhong, the Minister of Forestry, seriously lacked the party spirit and political responsibility that party members and leading cadres should possess and committed serious bureaucratic and dereliction of duty errors in his actions towards the party and the people. Dong Zhiyong, the Deputy Minister in charge of forest fire prevention, also lacked a sense of responsibility in his work and committed serious bureaucratic and dereliction of duty behaviors. He also had important responsibilities for the Daxing'anling forest fire accident. With the approval of the CPC Central Committee, the CCDI made the decision to dismiss Yang Zhong from his position as Party Secretary of the Ministry of Forestry. The State Council submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to dismiss Yang Zhong from his position as Minister of Forestry, as well as dismissing Dong Zhiyong from his position as Deputy Minister of Forestry, and assigned the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to conduct a thorough investigation.
The CPC Central Committee educates the entire party through handling major and significant cases, promoting a profound education on party conduct, and encouraging the entire party to jointly address issues related to party conduct. However, the struggle against corruption, advocating integrity, and correcting improper behaviors is a long-term process that runs through the entire process of reform, opening up, and modernization construction, so there is still a long way to go in this work.
Chapter 6: The Formation of the Third Generation of Central Leadership Collective and the Preliminary Establishment of Deng Xiaoping's Guiding Position
I. The Comprehensive Launch of Governance and Rectification, and the Proposal of a Series of "Dual Emphasis" Policies
After the 13th National Congress of the CPC, the Party continued to lead the people of the whole country in advancing along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since the start of reform and opening up, significant achievements have been made in economic development, which mainly include: sustained and stable economic growth, during the ten-year period, the gross domestic product (GDP), national fiscal revenue, and average income of urban and rural residents have all roughly doubled; some of the severe economic and social problems that have long plagued China have begun to be solved or have found solutions; the majority of the 1 billion population have achieved a decent standard of living, and some regions have started to move towards a well-off life. For the areas that have not yet completely achieved a decent standard of living, there have also been improvements in people's lives: market supply has greatly improved, fundamentally reversing the long-lasting scarcity of consumer goods in the past. From 1984 to 1988, it was a period of rapid development, with the GDP increasing from 717.1 billion yuan to 1.49 trillion yuan, demonstrating the dynamic situation of agriculture and industry, rural and urban areas, reform and development mutually promoting each other, and the comprehensive national strength reaching a new level.
1. The Comprehensive Launch of Governance and Rectification
With the deepening of reforms and rapid economic development, some deep-seated contradictions in the economic system have gradually emerged. At the same time, there has been a tendency to pursue speed and ignore objective constraints in the reform and construction process. In August 1988, in a situation where the macroeconomic environment was not relaxed, a decision was made to push for price reform, triggering a mass buying frenzy and causing social upheaval. A series of unstable and uncoordinated contradictions appeared in the economic operation, manifested as "four excesses and one disorder", namely excessive social demand, too fast industrial development speed, excessive credit and monetary injection, high inflation, and disorderly economic order. In response to these issues, the Party Central Committee timely made decisions to govern and reform: curb economic overheating, contain inflation, earnestly adjust economic structure to increase the production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil, establish and improve necessary economic regulations, as well as macro-control system and supervision system, and actively promote the construction of a new socialist market economic order. After about a year of governance and rectification, the trend of excessive economic development and the chaos in the economic field were reversed. 
With the deepening of reform and opening up, while the deep-seated contradictions in the economic system are highlighted, there have also been many new situations and problems in social trends. In this situation, the Party Central Committee has put forward the guideline of "both hands" to address these issues.
2. The era requires the guideline of "both hands".
Why should we adhere to the guideline of "both hands" in the process of socialist modernization construction? This is not the subjective imagination of a certain individual, but the embodiment of the objective laws of socialist modernization construction in China.
The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China explicitly put forward that the guideline of "both hands" is the strategic guideline for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The so-called strategic guideline has two aspects of meaning: first, in terms of importance, it means that both aspects of civilizational development should be pursued together, which is related to the fundamental direction and fundamental path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Because only by "both hands" can material civilization and spiritual civilization develop comprehensively, so as to improve China's overall national strength. Second, in terms of long-term perspective, it means that we must adhere to the pursuit of both aspects of civilization throughout the entire primary stage of socialism, rather than just for a while or in a specific period. If the Party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism remains unchanged for a hundred years, then the guideline of "both hands" must also remain unchanged for a long term. Adhering to the guideline of "both hands" is a profound summary of the lessons from the experience of reform and opening up. In order to promote the development of productive forces, we must accelerate the pace of reform. This revolution will unfold in a wide range of fields and to a considerable depth. It is related to the future of socialism and the interests of hundreds of millions of people. It is an extremely complex and mass exploration and innovation endeavor, which will not only bring about major changes in people's economic and political lives but also cause significant changes in their ways of life, thinking, and spiritual state. Therefore, it is inevitable to encounter some problems and negative phenomena.
From the practice of reform and opening up, we face three types of problems: the first is the inevitable emergence of new contradictions and problems in the process of transforming the old and new systems; the second is due to the reformers' inaccurate and incomplete understanding of the central policies, or due to lack of experience and inadequate consideration, certain deviations and mistakes occur in bold explorations; the third is some people taking advantage of the banner of reform to make illicit gains, engaging in corruption and illegal activities, undermining economic order and committing other crimes. We must handle the first two situations with caution, improve the understanding of the people, especially party members and cadres through education, and ensure the healthy progress of reform and opening up. For the third case, we will handle it strictly in accordance with party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal discipline, especially for serious economic crimes and other criminal activities. We will punish them severely according to the law, resolutely crack down on them, and never be lenient. Practice has proven that the deeper the reform, the more we must adhere to the "two-handed approach." Otherwise, the reform cannot proceed.
In the process of opening up to the outside world, on the one hand, we have introduced advanced technology, advanced equipment, and some management experiences and methods that are in line with large-scale socialized production. On the other hand, it is also difficult to avoid the mixed influences of the decayed elements of foreign capitalist capitalism, their way of life, certain reactionary political views, and sociological theories of the bourgeoisie. They may penetrate and even flow into our social life and people's spiritual world, causing serious harm. For example, in politics, the Western bourgeoisie's political views of "liberalism," "democratization," and "multi-party system" may infiltrate and give rise to bourgeois liberal trends. In terms of the economy, the Western bourgeoisie's values of pursuing only profit, harming others for one's own gain, materialism, as well as the behaviors of deception, fraud, smuggling, bribery, corruption, speculation, and profiteering may flow in, leading to economic crimes and other criminal activities. In terms of ideology and culture, some obscene videos, photos, movies, and yellow literature, books, music, and toxic sociological theories from overseas may be transmitted, polluting people's spiritual world and corroding their souls. Deng Xiaoping had foreseen this situation early on. He said that opening up to the outside world has opened windows for fresh air, but it has also let in mosquitoes and flies. Faced with this, what should we do? Closing the door is clearly not an option. The only choice is to both adhere to reform and opening up and oppose bourgeois liberalization and combat all kinds of criminal activities.
Therefore, in the historical process of deepening reform and opening up, adhering to the "two-handed approach" is an important condition to ensure the continuous vitality of the cause of reform and opening up, and it is also an objective requirement to maintain the correct path of reform.
3. The proposal and elaboration of a series of "two-handed approach" guidelines
The "two-handed approach" is an important governance experience summarized by the Communist Party of China during the process of reform and opening up in the new era. The so-called "two-handed approach" guideline has the following different levels of connotations: Firstly, one hand promotes the construction of material civilization, and the other hand promotes the construction of spiritual civilization; secondly, one hand promotes reform and opening up, and the other hand upholds the four fundamental principles; thirdly, one hand promotes reform and opening up, and the other hand combats economic crimes and other criminal activities; fourthly, one hand promotes the construction of two civilizations, and the other hand promotes the construction of democracy and the rule of law.
The "two-handed approach" guideline has evolved and enriched during the practice of reform and opening up in China. Deng Xiaoping, the architect of reform and opening up, was the first leader in the party to propose and emphasize the "two-handed approach" guideline.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, while formulating the strategic guidelines for reform, opening up, and modernization construction, Deng Xiaoping began to pay attention to the issue of the "two-handed approach." On October 30, 1979, in his speech representing the Central Committee to the Fourth National Congress of Chinese Literature and Art Workers, he first proposed the idea of simultaneously promoting the two civilizations. He said, "Our country has entered a new era of socialist modernization construction. We need to significantly improve social productivity while reforming and perfecting the socialist economic system and political system, promoting advanced socialist democracy and the comprehensive socialist legal system. In addition to building a highly developed material civilization, we must improve the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation, develop a noble and rich diverse cultural life, and construct a highly developed socialist spiritual civilization."
On December 25, 1980, the Central Working Conference was held in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping gave an important speech at this meeting, elaborating on the relationship between material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction, and further put forward the idea of "grasping both hands". He said, "The socialist country we want to build should not only have a high degree of material civilization, but also a high degree of spiritual civilization... The more the Party and the government implement various economic reforms and the policy of opening up to the outside world, the more party members, especially senior party cadres, should attach great importance to and practice communist ideology and communist morality."
On March 27, 1981, the person in charge of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army reported to Deng Xiaoping on the army's practice of "grasping both hands", which made Deng Xiaoping very happy. He said, "One thing that has been done well recently is emphasizing spiritual civilization. There have been achievements in this regard, and we must continue to do well."
With the development and deepening of reform and opening up, criminal activities in the economic field have shown a trend of growth and spread. The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, in response to this situation, conducted investigations and research and made the "Decision on Crackdown on Serious Criminal Activities in the Economic Field" (referred to as the "Decision"), and began to investigate and punish economic crimes.
On April 10, 1982, the Central Political Bureau held a meeting specifically to discuss this "Decision". Deng Xiaoping made an important speech at the meeting, clearly stating the issue of adhering to the "grasping both hands" principle in the reform and opening up. He said, "We must have both hands, one hand is to insist on the policy of opening up to the outside world and activating the domestic economy, and the other hand is to resolutely crack down on economic crimes. Without cracking down on economic crimes, the policy of opening up to the outside world will definitely fail, and the policy of activating the domestic economy will also fail. With the crackdown on economic crimes, opening up to the outside world and activating the economy can move in the right direction."
From this, it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping's meaning of "grasping both hands" has developed further, not only referring to grasping both types of civilization together, but also includes the reform and opening up as well as cracking down on economic crimes. Because this is related to the success or failure of the reform and opening up policy.
In order to make the whole Party deeply understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of "grasping both hands", Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized this guideline.
On July 4, 1982, the Central Military Commission held a symposium, and Deng Xiaoping proposed four guarantees for adherence to the socialist system and good modernization construction in his speech: the first is institutional reform; the second is to promote socialist spiritual civilization; the third is to resolutely crack down on criminal activities in the economic field; and the fourth is to improve the Party's construction, rectify the Party's organization and style. He emphasized, "We must adhere to the 'grasping both hands' approach of opening up to the outside world and activating the domestic economy. However, in order to ensure that this policy can truly benefit the Four Modernizations construction and not deviate from the socialist direction, we must also have another hand, which is cracking down on economic crimes. Without this hand, there will be no constraints." "The four guarantees cannot be achieved all at once, they must be pursued in the long term. Although we do not advocate for movements, with the progress of the four modernizations, we must adhere to the four guarantees and never deviate from them, turning them into ongoing work and struggle."
In October 1982, at the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's "grasping with both hands" ideology, the principle of simultaneously developing both material and spiritual civilization was established as a strategic guideline for socialist modernization, guiding the work of the entire Party. According to the principle of "grasping with both hands," the Party not only focused on the development of material civilization but also strengthened the construction of spiritual civilization, achieving certain results.
However, due to various subjective and objective reasons, the construction of spiritual civilization in our country did not achieve the expected results and even exhibited a trend of deterioration, with both hard and soft approaches being adopted. Specifically, the manifestations are as follows:
(1) The rampant breeding of corruption, and the continuation of negative practices within the Party. The central government has taken measures to investigate and handle major cases, achieving some results. However, these results were not consolidated, and coupled with the lack of corresponding reforms, the weakening of ideological and political work has led to a significant increase in illegal practices by some party and government officials, such as using their positions for personal gain, bribery, indulging in extravagant lifestyles, and corruption. Privileges, connections, and nepotism have become prevalent, and the Party's original purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people has been forgotten, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the masses.
(2) The decline in social morals, with many members of society losing their sense of direction. The failure to effectively curb negative practices and corruption within the Party has severely affected the credibility and cohesion of the Party and the government among the masses. Superstitions and feudal activities in certain areas have not been effectively suppressed, and issues such as gambling, prostitution, and pornography continue to exist. Particularly, the proliferation of explicit videos and publications have seriously harmed the thoughts and souls of young people.
(3) The worrying situation in education and scientific and technological development. Due to difficulties and problems encountered in the reform of the education and scientific and technological systems, as well as insufficient financial support from the government, the income of a large number of education and scientific workers has remained low for a long time. The phenomenon of intellectuals prioritizing physical labor over mental labor persists and even expands. The conditions for education and scientific research have not seen the necessary improvements, severely impacting the enthusiasm of intellectuals. As a result, brain drain and job-hopping among intellectuals in some regions are on the rise. Under such circumstances, the motivation for students to study has decreased, and the slogan "60 points is enough" has become a common phrase among some students, with dropout rates increasing in rural areas. China's education and scientific and technological development are once again facing formidable challenges.
The central leadership soon became aware of this situation of adopting both hard and soft approaches. On September 23, 1985, Deng Xiaoping sharply criticized this mistake during the CPC's national congress. He said, "The construction of socialist spiritual civilization was proposed a long time ago. The central government, local governments, and the military have all done a lot of work, especially with the emergence of a large number of advanced individuals who have had a positive influence. However, looking at the whole country, the results are still not ideal. The main problem is that the entire Party has not taken it seriously... Production has improved in recent years, but the influence of capitalism and feudalism has not been reduced to the minimum, and even some bad things that had long disappeared after liberation are making a comeback." If we do not make a major determination to change this situation quickly, how can we fully realize the superiority of socialism? How can we effectively educate our people and future generations? Without strengthening the construction of spiritual civilization, the construction of material civilization will also be destroyed and go astray. Relying solely on material conditions, our revolution and construction cannot be victorious."
In order to attract the attention of the whole party, especially the central leadership comrades, Deng Xiaoping once again discussed the issue of "grasping both hands" on January 17, 1986, at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau. He pointed out: To achieve the four modernizations, we must have both hands, one hand is not enough. The so-called "both hands" refers to one hand for construction and one hand for the legal system... We have achieved significant success in economic construction and the situation is favorable, which is the success of our country. But if the moral atmosphere continues to deteriorate, what is the meaning of economic success? It will degenerate in another aspect and develop into a world of rampant corruption, theft, and bribery. Therefore, we must adhere to the four persistences and adhere to the dictatorship, which can ensure the smooth progress of our socialist modernization construction and effectively deal with those who undermine construction. He emphasized that we must focus on the construction of spiritual civilization and improve the party's style and social atmosphere starting from specific events. He also emphasized that the higher the cadres' children, the higher the cadres, and the more famous they are, the more their illegal activities must be closely investigated and typical cases should be grasped. Because these people commit crimes and cause great harm, catching and dealing with them will have a great effect, demonstrating our determination to overcome all obstacles in building spiritual civilization. He believed that if this matter is done well, it can truly promote reform and construction. With such determination, it will take at least ten years of struggle to restore the party's style and social atmosphere to the best period of the 1950s.
From the above situations, Deng Xiaoping made great contributions in the process of formulating the party's strategic policy of "grasping both hands". In order to firmly adhere to the policy of "grasping both hands", he has long struggled against various erroneous thoughts. He never compromises or gives in on this important principle issue. In the process of fighting against erroneous thoughts, Deng Xiaoping also enriched and developed the strategic thinking of "grasping both hands".
4. Gradual advancement of the policy of "grasping both hands" in practice
With the deepening of the reform and opening up, the party's thinking on "grasping both hands" has also been gradually implemented in practice. While concentrating on promoting economic construction, the whole country has also begun to vigorously strengthen the "other hand" in terms of ideology, culture, and other fields.
(1) Gradual development of socialist spiritual civilization construction. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the start of reform and opening up and the comprehensive development of socialist modernization construction, the Party Central Committee gradually put the task of socialist spiritual civilization construction on the agenda.
① The proposal of the ideological construction of spiritual civilization. In March 1979, Deng Xiaoping proposed in his speech on "Adhering to the Four Fundamental Principles" at the Party's theoreticians' conference to maintain lofty revolutionary ideals, improve the moral level of the whole people, transform social atmosphere, and rectify the party's style, etc. This actually proposes some fundamental requirements for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. In September of the same year, Ye Jianying first proposed the concept of socialist spiritual civilization in his speech at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said, "While building a highly material civilization, we must improve the education, science, and cultural level of the whole nation, establish lofty revolutionary ideals and revolutionary moral standards, develop noble and colorful cultural life, and build a highly socialist spiritual civilization. These are important goals of our socialist modernization and necessary conditions for achieving the Four Modernizations." This statement not only clearly puts forward the concept of spiritual civilization, but also outlines the content of socialist spiritual civilization, including education, science, health, revolutionary ideals, revolutionary moral standards, and cultural life, thus clearly stating the construction of socialist spiritual civilization as an important goal and necessary condition for China's modernization.
On December 20, 1980, at the Central Work Conference, Li Chang, one of the leaders of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences at the time, wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping calling for the strengthening of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Deng Xiaoping wrote in his reply, "The questions raised in Comrade Li Chang's letter are worth considering. It is proposed to issue this letter for the comrades who attended the Central Work Conference to read." On December 25, in his speech at this conference, Deng Xiaoping accepted Li Chang's suggestion and discussed the construction of socialist spiritual civilization as an important topic, once again emphasizing its importance. He said, "The so-called spiritual civilization not only refers to education, science, and culture (which is completely necessary), but also refers to the ideology, ideals, beliefs, morals, discipline of communism, revolutionary positions and principles, comradeship between people, and so on." Here, the construction of socialist spiritual civilization is summarized into two basic aspects, namely scientific and cultural construction, and ideological and moral construction, making the connotation of spiritual civilization construction more clear.
In June 1981, the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the Party since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, passed at the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, included spiritual civilization as one of the ten basic points of China's socialist modernization construction. Moreover, for the first time in the form of a resolution of a plenary session of the Party's Central Committee, it determined the construction of a "modern, highly democratic, and highly civilized socialist power" as the guiding program for the Party in the new historical period.
② The gradual development of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. In February 1981, nine units including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation jointly issued a proposal in response to the central government's call to strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization, advocating the promotion of the "Five Emphases and Four Beauties" activities, including advocating civilization, politeness, hygiene, orderliness, morality, aesthetic beauty, language beauty, behavioral beauty, and environmental beauty among the people, especially the youth. On February 28, the Ministry of Propaganda, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued a notice on the promotion of civilized and polite activities. In accordance with the requirements of the notice, the publicity and education activities focusing on the "Five Emphases and Four Beauties" as the main content were widely carried out throughout the country.
At the beginning of 1982, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee forwarded a report from the Ministry of Propaganda on the in-depth promotion of the "Five Emphases" and "Four Beauties" activities. That spring, according to the deployment of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, the "National Civilization and Politeness Month" activity was carried out nationwide, focusing on improving environmental hygiene and addressing the problems of "dirtiness," "disorder," and "poor quality." In January 1983, more than 20 departments including the Ministry of Propaganda proposed to carry out educational activities promoting "love for the motherland, love for socialism, and love for the people" in the "Five Emphases and Four Beauties" activities, further enriching the content of the spiritual civilization construction activities.
In September 1982, the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China summarized the achievements of the Party's understanding of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, emphasizing the theoretical exposition of the construction of a highly socialist spiritual civilization. The Twelfth National Congress proposed that "socialist spiritual civilization is an important characteristic of socialism and an important manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system", and determined the construction of a high level of socialist material civilization while striving to build a high level of socialist spiritual civilization as a strategic policy for China's socialist modernization construction.
In accordance with the requirements put forward by the Twelfth National Congress to strive for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, in March 1983, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to establish the "Five Emphasizes, Four Beautifies, Three Loves" activity committees at the central and provincial, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality levels, and established corresponding offices. In that year, the "Creating a Civilization City" activity began to rise in Sanming, Fujian. There were also military-civilian joint construction of civilized villages and towns and civilized street activities in Baoding, Hebei, and other places. The following year, relevant departments of the central government held the National Conference on "Five Emphasizes, Four Beautifies, Three Loves" activities in Sanming, Fujian, summarizing the experience of carrying out the activities in large and medium-sized cities nationwide, especially the experience of Sanming. It required the whole country to learn from Sanming to promote the construction of spiritual civilization in cities. Since then, the "Five Emphasizes, Four Beautifies, Three Loves" activities have been widely carried out in urban and rural areas of our country in an organized and leadership-driven manner, focusing on creating a beautiful environment, establishing good order, providing quality services, and constructing civilized units, among other things.
③ The formulation of the first guiding principle for the construction of spiritual civilization. After 1984, with the comprehensive opening up and reform in our country, a large number of new contradictions and problems emerged in the social field, making the task of constructing spiritual civilization more prominent than before. In October 1984, the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the CPC passed the "Decision on Economic System Reform by the Central Committee of the CPC", which also put forward corresponding requirements for the construction of spiritual civilization. The National Congress of the Party, held in September 1985, also regarded "adhering to the simultaneous advancement of material civilization construction and vigorously strengthening socialist spiritual civilization construction" as one of the basic guiding principles that must be followed in the national economic and social development during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. This was the first time that the problem of spiritual civilization construction had been included in the planning for national economic and social development, indicating that the Party had started to consider the issue of spiritual civilization construction from the perspective of development strategies and guiding ideology. Based on this, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party, held in September 1986, deliberated and passed the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPC on the Guiding Principles for Socialist Spiritual Civilization Construction" (referred to as the "Resolution"). This was the first programmatic document issued by our Party on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. The "Resolution", starting from the strategic height of building socialism comprehensively and the overall layout of our country's modernization construction, made clear provisions on the guiding principles and fundamental tasks for the construction of spiritual civilization.
First, it clarifies the position and role of the construction of spiritual civilization in the overall layout of China's socialist modernization construction. The "Resolution" points out that the overall layout of China's socialist modernization construction is: taking economic construction as the center, adhering to economic system reform, adhering to political system reform, and strengthening the construction of spiritual civilization, and ensuring coordination and mutual promotion among these aspects.
Second, it puts forward the guiding principles and fundamental tasks for the construction of spiritual civilization. The guiding principle is that the construction of spiritual civilization must promote socialist modernization; it must promote comprehensive reform and opening up; it must adhere to the four cardinal principles. The fundamental task is to meet the needs of socialist modernization construction, cultivate socialist citizens with ideals, ethics, culture, and discipline, and improve the ideological, moral, scientific, and cultural qualities of the entire Chinese nation.
Third, it provides a more practical exposition of the specific content of the construction of spiritual civilization. The resolution proposes to mobilize and unite the people of all ethnic groups in China with the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and clarifies the relationship between the highest ideals of our party and the common ideals of the people of all ethnic groups in China. It dialectically combines the requirements of advancement with the requirements of broadness. It puts forward the basic requirements for the construction of socialist ethics, emphasizes the education of socialist democracy, the rule of law, and discipline among all the people, vividly reflecting that the socialist spiritual civilization we want to build is the unity of revolutionary spirit, democratic spirit, and scientific spirit. It emphasizes the solid promotion of education, science, and culture throughout the nation.
The resolution also clarifies the guiding role of Marxism in the construction of spiritual civilization and the responsibilities of party organizations and party members in the construction of spiritual civilization. The resolution adheres to the basic viewpoints on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization put forward by our party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and at the same time, it has made new developments in many aspects, marking the preliminary formation of the theoretical framework for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization with Chinese characteristics. This resolution has important guiding significance for guiding and promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and ensuring the smooth development of socialist modernization.
(2) Eliminating the spiritual pollution in the ideological field and opposing bourgeois liberalization. In the early 1980s, in the field of theory, some people created confusion in the issues of humanism and alienation, attributing all the problems existing in society to the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party; in the field of news, some people set up an opposition between party nature and public nature; in the field of literature and art, some people denied Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts, showing indifference towards the slogan proposed by the CPC Central Committee that literature and art should serve the people and socialism, leading to the appearance of works with serious erroneous tendencies, even low-level vulgar and pornographic books and magazines on screen, stage and in the book market.
In response to this situation, at the Second Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee held in October 1983, Deng Xiaoping delivered a speech proposing "we cannot allow spiritual pollution on the ideological front", "the essence of spiritual pollution is the dissemination of various decadent and corrupt ideas of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, the dissemination of distrust towards the cause of socialism, communism and the leadership of the Communist Party". "In the long run, this issue is related to what kind of generation will take over our cause, and it is related to the fate and future of the Party and the country." Criticism and correction must be carried out in response to this.
Based on the spirit of this conference, struggles against spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalization were launched throughout the country. After a series of efforts, the spread of bourgeois liberalization trend was basically curbed, and the leadership of the Communist Party of China on the ideological front was strengthened. However, the elimination of interference does not mean that there will be no more interference from bourgeois liberalization.
In 1986, Fang Lizhi, Liu Binyan, Wang Ruowang, and others, taking advantage of the opportunity to study political system reform, brazenly attacked the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, attracting the attention of some senior leaders of the Communist Party of China, especially Deng Xiaoping. In September 1986, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to some opinions that were not in favor of opposing bourgeois liberalization, Deng Xiaoping explicitly stated: "I have talked the most and I am the most persistent in opposing bourgeois liberalization." "What is liberalization? In actuality, it means pushing our current policies towards the road of capitalism." "Liberalization itself belongs to the bourgeoisie, there is no proletarian or socialist liberalization. Liberalization itself is in opposition to our current policies and systems, it is either against, or modifying." "It seems that opposing liberalization needs to be discussed not only this time, but also in the next ten or twenty years."
However, Deng Xiaoping's warning did not receive enough attention, especially from the leaders who were in charge of the central work at that time. In the second half of 1986, the trend of liberalization once again spread. Fang Lizhi, Wang Ruowang, Liu Binyan, and others became even more active. They pointed their fingers at our country's political system, claiming that the socialist cause since the founding of the new China has failed, and the communist movement over the past thirty years has been a failure; they completely reject the leadership of the Communist Party of China, advocate for the implementation of a multi-party system, and attack the leadership of the Communist Party of China as a continuation of feudal rule and a one-party dictatorship; they glorify bourgeois democracy and advocate abandoning people's democratic dictatorship; they belittle the guiding role of Marxism in China's revolution and construction.
In this situation, the propaganda of party newspapers and magazines did not take strong measures to resist, resulting in mistakes in guiding public opinion, allowing bourgeois liberalization to spread at one point. In the second half of 1986, various liberal ideas flowed into the lecterns of universities. According to incomplete statistics, from October to late December 1986, Beijing University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University jointly held more than twenty speeches, symposiums, and other events attended by these people. These reports had a great impact on the thinking of some students.
In January 1987, several young ideological and political workers conducted investigations on the ideological status of university students in several key universities in Beijing and found that students were engaging to varying degrees in discussions on political system reform and cultural reflection. According to the survey, students had four dissatisfactions: First, they were dissatisfied with the pace of reform, believing that the progress was too slow and faced significant resistance with minimal effects; second, they were dissatisfied with democratic rights, believing that the democratic rights of workers, peasants, and intellectuals were practically insignificant; third, they were dissatisfied with the state of party discipline, believing that although major corruption cases had been cracked down upon, people were still resentful of the phenomenon of officials using their power for personal gain; fourth, they were dissatisfied with the implementation of policies concerning intellectuals, believing that there was much fanfare but little actual impact. These four dissatisfactions led to four reflections among university students: first, reflection on the fundamental lessons of the Chinese revolution; second, reflection on the comparison of two social systems; third, reflection on traditional Chinese culture; fourth, reflection on Marxism.
"Reflection" gave rise to many negative things, and combined with the rapidly changing international political scene in 1986, such as the escape of former Philippine President Marcos and the disintegration of dictatorial rule in Haiti, all of these continuously impacted students' values. They were no longer satisfied with mere changes in ideas and empty rhetoric. The emotions of most students shifted from uneasiness to dissatisfaction, with a latent sense of impulse and a strong sense of participation. In the second half of 1986, various cities saw demonstrations and other activities of varying scales.
In response to the above phenomena, on December 30, 1986, Deng Xiaoping met with Hu Yaobang and other top leaders of the central government and clearly stated the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining and developing the good situation of stability and unity, advancing reform and opening up, and promoting socialist modernization. The correct handling of the problem of student unrest at the current time was also elucidated. The core was that "the four cardinal principles must be upheld," "without the dictatorship of the people, it won't work," "China has no future without the leadership of the Communist Party," and "democracy can only be gradually opened up and we cannot adopt the Western model." Resolutely "oppose bourgeois liberalization" for "China to have hope." Deng Xiaoping's speech further strengthened the determination of the Communist Party of China to oppose bourgeois liberalization. On January 6, 1987, Beijing's universities disseminated Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned speech to all students and promptly resolved the issues of student unrest in a few universities.
On January 12, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to restructure the leadership team of the University of Science and Technology of China. On January 13, 17, and 23, respectively, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Anhui Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the decision to expel Wang Ruowang, Fang Lizhi, and Liu Binyan from the Party.
After a series of work, the Party and the government quelled the student movements that occurred at the end of 1986, adhered to the Party's correct leadership in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and ensured the healthy development of China's socialist cause.
(3) Severe crackdown on economic crimes. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party and the state formulated and implemented policies centered on economic development, opening up to the outside world, and revitalizing the economy, which led to rapid development of our country's economy. However, during the process of reform and opening up, some unhealthy factors inevitably emerged. Due to the failure to timely keep up with necessary management measures, insufficient attention to and inadequate prevention and crackdown on economic crimes, and various other factors, economic criminal activities increased. Some staff members of state organs were corrupted in their thinking, taking advantage of their powers or loopholes in economic management, willfully embezzling, stealing, and defrauding national assets, forming a wave of economic crime. Along with the serious development of other criminal activities, economic crimes such as smuggling, speculation, embezzlement, theft, and market disruptions also escalated and proliferated.
The aforementioned economic crimes have attracted the attention of the central government. In January 1982, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an urgent notice on cracking down on serious economic crimes, pointing out that this is a major issue related to the construction of the Four Modernizations in our country and the survival or demise of the nation. On March 8th, the 22nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the 5th National People's Congress passed the "Decision on Severe Punishment of Criminals Who Seriously Undermine the Economy", which increased the penalties for serious economic crimes, including the death penalty for economic criminals with particularly serious circumstances and extremely heinous nature. On April 10th, Deng Xiaoping pointed out at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee discussing "the crackdown on serious criminal activities in the economic field": cracking down on economic crimes is a long-term and constant struggle accompanying the construction of the Four Modernizations. "We must have two hands, one is to adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world and revitalizing the economy internally, and the other is to resolutely crack down on economic criminal activities. Without the hand of cracking down on economic criminal activities, the policy of opening up to the outside world is bound to fail, and the policy of revitalizing the economy internally will also fail. With the hand of cracking down on economic criminal activities, the policies of opening up to the outside world and revitalizing the economy can go in the right direction." "This wave has come ferociously. If our party does not pay serious attention to it and does not firmly stop it, then our party and country will indeed face the problem of whether or not to 'change their appearance.'"
On April 13, 1982, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Decision on Cracking Down on Serious Criminal Activities in the Economic Field", sharply pointing out that cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic field, conducting the struggle against corruption and degeneration, is related to the success or failure of our country's socialist modernization construction, and is related to the rise and fall of our party and nation. This struggle will inevitably be long-term and protracted. In accordance with the requirements of the central government, a massive campaign to crack down on economic crimes was carried out nationwide. According to the report submitted by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Standing Committee of the 6th National People's Congress in July 1983, a total of more than 190,000 economic crime cases of various types that were exposed and investigated in accordance with Party discipline and state laws from January 1982 to the end of April 1983, involving more than 71,000 party members. More than 131,000 cases have been closed, nearly 30,000 people have been sentenced according to law, and more than 8,500 people among the party members involved in the cases have been expelled from the party. A total of 24,400 people have voluntarily surrendered and confessed various economic crimes. More than 410 million yuan of illicit money and property have been recovered. On May 31st, at a party and government cadre conference held by the Discipline Inspection Commission, Wan Li delivered a speech demanding that all units carry out the crackdown on serious criminal activities in the economic field seriously. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has dispatched 151 officials at or above the bureau level to various locations to strengthen the investigative strength in combating economic crimes, directly participating in the investigation and handling of major cases.
According to the central deployment, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has resolutely dealt with some major cases that violated party discipline and had a severe impact. At that time, the major cases that had a significant impact mainly included the "Jinjiang Fake Medicine" case in Fujian and the "Hainan Island Sale of Imported Cars" incident.
In order to open up the sales of white fungus drinks, some people in Chenkang Town, Jinjiang County, Fujian (now Quanzhou City) falsely claimed it to be cold medicine, printed the words "nourishes Yin and moistens the lungs, treats asthenia cough" on it, and imitated the pharmaceutical department's approval number to promote it within and outside the province. From September 1982 to April 1985, lawbreakers from 59 township enterprises successively forged more than 170 approval numbers from the health administrative department, among which 62 were widely used, producing more than 100 varieties of counterfeit drugs with a total output of more than 100,000 boxes and a total value of about RMB 40 million. These counterfeit drugs were sold to 28 provinces (regions) nationwide, causing a great sensation and attracting the attention of senior leaders in the central government. On July 13, 1985, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued an open letter to the Jinjiang Prefectural Party Committee and the Prefectural Government, demanding that the case of some enterprises in Jinjiang manufacturing a large quantity of counterfeit drugs and selling them through various forms of bribery be investigated in accordance with the law and reported to the central government. On July 27, after listening to reports from the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection took legal measures against those involved and decided to dismiss and investigate the Jinjiang County Standing Committee Member and Secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection who participated in manufacturing and selling counterfeit drugs for profiting. In September 1986, the Higher People's Court of Fujian Province and the Intermediate People's Court of Quanzhou City sentenced the criminals involved in the "Jinjiang Fake Medicine Case" who manufactured and sold counterfeit drugs. Among them, 3 were sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years, 7 were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 1 year and 6 months to 8 years, 4 were sentenced to probation, and 3 were exempted from criminal punishment. The handling of the "Jinjiang Fake Medicine Case" severely cracked down on the illegal activities of economic criminals.
From January 1, 1984, to March 5, 1985, the leading comrades of the Hainan District Party Committee and the District Government violated party discipline and relevant national regulations, and used the autonomy granted by the central government to import a large number of goods that were controlled by the state from abroad and sold them for profit. More than 10,000 imported cars have been sold off the island. Most of the other imported goods were also sold off the island. In order to import cars and other goods, the relevant cadres in Hainan Island violated the national foreign exchange management regulations and illegally acquired US $570 million in foreign exchange from outside the island at a high price, which was ten times the amount of foreign exchange allowed for Hainan to retain. At the same time, loans for importing cars and other goods amounted to a cumulative total of RMB 4.21 billion, which was 1 billion yuan more than Hainan's total industrial and agricultural output value in 1984. Many of the loans were actually unable to be repaid, with 2.01 billion yuan still outstanding at the time of the case. These actions not only violated relevant national regulations, but also undermined national plans, markets, and credit policies, and also hindered the development of Hainan's emerging large-scale development and construction. After the "Car Incident" occurred, a joint investigation group composed of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the National Audit Office, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the State Council Special Economic Zone Office, the State Supplies Bureau, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Guangdong Provincial People's Government conducted an investigation for more than two months and wrote the "Investigation Report on the Issue of Importing and Selling Cars and Other Goods in Hainan". On July 31, the report was forwarded by the central government and the State Council. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection agreed with the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Government's disciplinary actions against the parties involved in this disciplinary violation case. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Government also conducted inspections as a result.
The investigation and handling of the above-mentioned economic criminal cases effectively safeguarded the seriousness of party discipline and national laws, and to a certain extent ensured the healthy development of the reform, opening up, and modernization construction endeavors.
II. The "Tiananmen Square Incident" and the Formation of the Third Generation Central Leadership Collective
Just as the work of governing the economic environment and rectifying the economic order needed to be deepened, a political turmoil took place in Beijing and other areas in the spring and summer of 1989. The Party Central Committee took resolute measures and effectively quelled the turbulence. For a long time, certain political forces from Western countries had been using various channels to infiltrate socialist countries ideologically and politically, supporting various anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. After the occurrence of turmoil in some socialist countries in Eastern Europe, some Western countries further intensified their efforts to promote peaceful evolution in China through various channels. In addition, during a period of time, a minority of leading comrades within the Party lacked consistency in adhering to the four cardinal principles and the ideological and political work weakened, while the serious phenomenon of corruption among some officials seriously damaged the Party's image among the people. In the spring and summer of 1989, a small number of people took advantage of existing problems within the Party's work and the public's dissatisfaction with rising prices, especially the corruption of some officials, to incite activities against the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. They spread rumors on a large scale under the pretext of the masses mourning for Hu Yaobang, and organized a planned and organized anti-Party and anti-socialist turmoil. In the Beijing area, they incited some uninformed people to occupy Tiananmen Square and attack key departments of the Party and government. With the strong support of the older generation of revolutionaries such as Deng Xiaoping, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, relying on the people, resolutely opposed the turmoil, quelled the political turbulence, defended the socialist state power, and safeguarded the fundamental interests of the people.
This political turmoil deeply educated the Party and the people. On June 9, 1989, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in a speech: the nature of this incident is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and adherence to the four cardinal principles. This turmoil was bound to happen sooner or later, determined by the international climate and China's own small climate, and could not be changed by people's will. This incident, which erupted, is worth pondering and prompts us to calmly reflect on the past and consider the future. He raised two questions that need serious consideration. First, is the route, principles, and policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, including the development strategy of the "three-step" plan, correct or not? Does the correctness of the route, principles, and policies we formulated have problems because of this turmoil? Should we continue to use it as the goal of our future struggle? Second, does the summary of the "one central task, two basic points" at the 13th Party Congress hold true? Were the four cardinal principles and the policy of reform and opening up wrong? To these two questions, he firmly answered that the route, principles, and policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, including our development strategy of the "three-step" plan, are not wrong, and the correctness of our strategic goals should not be questioned because of this incident. The route of the "one central task, two basic points" is not wrong. The four cardinal principles themselves are not wrong, and the policy of reform and opening up is also not wrong. The basic route, principles, and policies we have formulated should be steadfastly implemented. "If there are any mistakes, it is that we have not consistently adhered to the four cardinal principles"; "If anything is lacking, it is that the reform and opening up has not gone far enough."
This turbulence seriously disrupted the progress of reform and opening up and modernization construction, while also exposing problems within the central leadership of the Party, necessitating a reshuffle. Even before the turbulence had been completely extinguished, Deng Xiaoping proposed the change of the central leadership, stating that the new central leadership should present a new appearance to the people and be a promising leading core that implements reforms. People who are recognized by the people as upholding the route of reform and opening up and having achievements should be selected to form a promising leadership collective that implements reforms. Trust must be gained from the people, and the Party must be trustworthy, as well as trusted by the people. According to Deng Xiaoping's suggestions and after sufficient deliberation, Jiang Zemin, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, became the candidate to lead the new generation of central leadership. In late June 1989, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) analyzed the nature and causes of the recent political turbulence in the country, and preliminarily summed up the experiences and lessons learned. The plenary session made the decision to remove Zhao Ziyang from all his leadership positions within the party due to serious mistakes he made during the crucial moment of suppressing the turmoil, and made adjustments to some members of the central leadership. The plenary session elected Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee and formed a new Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. The plenary session emphasized the need to resolutely implement the party's policies, principles, and guidelines since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, as well as the fundamental guideline of "one central task and two basic points" determined at the 13th National Congress of the CPC.
Suppressing domestic political turbulence was originally China's internal affair. However, some Western countries took advantage of this opportunity to impose sanctions on China, attempting to force a change in the direction of socialist development. Facing tremendous pressure domestically and internationally, the central leadership collective with Jiang Zemin as the core took up the important responsibility of leading the party and the country, leading the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in withstanding the pressure and firmly adhering to the basic line of socialism in the primary stage. The CPC Central Committee took a series of major measures to quickly restore normal production and social order in Beijing and other places, and maintained the political stability of the whole country. They investigated and dealt with major cases and intensified the fight against corruption. In order to overcome the phenomenon of being "hard in one hand and soft in the other," all levels of party organizations were required to focus on party building and strengthen their leadership in propaganda and ideological work. The policies of governance and rectification were continued, and the reform and opening up as well as economic development progressed, gradually improving the national economic situation.
Since the new central leadership collective has effectively carried out their work, Deng Xiaoping requested to resign from the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the CPC to the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. In November 1989, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CPC approved Deng Xiaoping's request. The plenary session expressed high respect for Deng Xiaoping's act of personally setting an example by resigning from his current position in accordance with the fundamental interests of the party and the country, thus abolishing the lifelong tenure system for leading cadres. It also emphasized that "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of viewpoints and theories based on integrating Marxism-Leninism with China's practice, especially the basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, are an important part of Mao Zedong Thought, a continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions, and a valuable spiritual wealth of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people." The entire party must seriously study the works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and make it play a significant guiding role in China's great process of socialist modernization.
From the Fourth Plenary Session to the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CPC, the second-generation central leadership collective with Deng Xiaoping as the core smoothly handed over power to the third-generation central leadership collective with Jiang Zemin as the core, ensuring the stability and continuity of the party's policies and the stability of the country, and allowing the reform and opening up as well as the socialist modernization process to continue advancing. This fully demonstrates the political maturity and organizational strength of the party, and also provides the most important political and organizational guarantee for maintaining long-term stability of the country and pushing forward the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century.
III. The Publication of Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour and the Initial Establishment of Deng Xiaoping's Theoretical Guidance Position
In the 1990s, the theoretical literature on socialist experience entered a new era. Socialist countries in Eastern Europe experienced dramatic changes, the Soviet Union declared its dissolution, and some countries and regions around China, especially in Southeast Asia, showed signs of accelerated economic development. The world order presented a trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization. This posed severe challenges to China, but also provided new development opportunities.
The governance and rectification that started in 1988, although achieved great success in stabilizing the economy, resulted in a slowdown in economic development. In 1989 and 1990, the growth rate of our country's economy was 4.1% and 3.8% respectively. Deng Xiaoping was extremely concerned about this. On March 3, 1990, during a conversation with the central leadership, he pointed out: "We must particularly pay attention to the problem of the sliding economic development speed. This is not just an economic problem; it is actually a political problem. Whether China can withstand the pressure of hegemonism and power politics, adhere to our socialist system, depends crucially on whether we can achieve faster growth speed and realize our development strategy." Faced with the complex situation at home and abroad, some people became confused and doubtful about China's reform and opening-up, lacking confidence in the future of socialism.
1. Publication of Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Speech
At a critical moment when the historical development of the Party and the country was again at a crossroads, from January 18 to February 21, 1992, the 88-year-old Deng Xiaoping visited Wuhan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shanghai, and other places, delivering speeches of great importance. He comprehensively summarized the experiences in exploring the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics by the Party and the people since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and clearly answered many major theoretical and policy questions that had often troubled and constrained people's thoughts since the reform and opening-up. The Southern Tour Speech elucidated the following ten key points:
(1) We must unwaveringly adhere to the basic line that will last for 100 years and propose that reform is also to liberate productivity. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that revolution liberates productivity, and reform also liberates productivity. In the past, we only emphasized developing productivity under socialist conditions and did not fully discuss the need to liberate productivity through reform. We should speak comprehensively about both liberating and developing productivity. He emphasized that it is crucial to adhere to the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and the key lies in adhering to the "one central task, two basic points". "Without adhering to socialism, without reform and opening-up, without developing the economy, and without improving people's lives, there is only a dead end. The basic line must be adhered to for 100 years without wavering. Only by adhering to this line will the people believe in you and support you. Anyone who wants to change the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee will be rejected by the ordinary people and will be overthrown."
(2) Introduced the "Three Favorable Standards" for judging the correctness of reform and opening-up. The 13th National Congress of the Party had a significant impact on upholding the Party's basic line centered on economic construction based on Mao Zedong's ideas in "On the Coalition Government". In order to continue to dispel people's doubts about reform and opening-up, Deng Xiaoping further pointed out in the Southern Tour Speech that we should have more courage in reform and opening-up, dare to experiment. For those things that have been identified, we should boldly try and boldly explore. A key experience in Shenzhen is daring to take risks. Who can claim to have absolute certainty and no risk when doing anything? Without daring to take risks, we cannot make progress in reform and opening up. It is all about fear of too much capitalism and taking the capitalist road. The crux of the matter is whether we should prioritize "capital" or "socialism." In response to the debates on establishing special economic zones for a certain period of time, he clearly stated, "The criteria for judgment should mainly depend on whether it benefits the development of socialist productive forces, enhances the comprehensive national strength of socialist countries, and improves people's standard of living." "Special economic zones should be affiliated with socialism, not capitalism." He also said that different opinions on the policy of reform and opening up should be allowed, but there should not be endless debates because it would waste time and prevent any accomplishments.
(3) It was clearly stated that planning and the market are not the essential differences between socialism and capitalism; socialism can also adopt a market economy. As early as 1979, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that we cannot say that a market economy only exists in capitalist societies; socialism can also adopt a market economy. He continued to focus on and study this issue, speaking about it more than ten times, and believed that there is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and a market economy. He emphasized, "Don't think that implementing a market economy means following the capitalist road, it's not like that at all. It serves socialism, it is socialism." In the Southern Tour Speech, he once again emphasized, "Whether there should be more planning or more market is not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. Planned economy does not equal socialism, capitalism also has planned elements; a market economy does not equal capitalism, socialism also has elements of the market. Planning and the market are both economic means." He also demanded that socialism boldly absorb and learn from all advanced management methods and operational models that reflect modern socialized production laws in countries around the world, including developed capitalist countries. This viewpoint had a decisive impact on the official proposal of the theory of socialist market economy at the 14th Party Congress, eventually leading to China's transformation from a planned economy to a socialist market economy.
(4) For the first time, the essence of socialism was clearly defined to correct the unscientific understanding of socialism's essence. What is the essence of socialism? From 160 years of moving from utopian socialism to scientific socialism, communists have pursued socialism as an ideal, but they have never posed the question in this way before, and the "canon" of Marxist-Leninist works has also never defined this question. People have simply been accustomed to thinking that socialism means public ownership, distribution according to work, planned economy, proletarian dictatorship, and guided by Marxism, and so on. These elements are undoubtedly important for building socialism, but considering them as the understanding of socialism's essence is not scientific. This does not correspond to the general principle of historical materialism that defines the social form from the perspective of the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, and it deviates from the understanding of the fundamental contradiction in socialist society - the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, as well as the contradiction between superstructure and economic base. These elements, which were ambiguously regarded as the essence of socialism, belong to the content of production relations and superstructure, completely neglecting the requirements of developing productive forces. This was a cognitive root of past mistakes made in the exploration of socialism. Deng Xiaoping, in the mid-1980s, deeply reflected on the lessons of building socialism in our country and earnestly pointed out, "Although we are also practicing socialism now, we are not up to par in reality." One important reason for this is that we did not regard concentrating our efforts on developing productive forces as the fundamental task of socialism. With such a painful lesson, Deng Xiaoping first raised the issue of the essence of socialism in the Southern Talk. He pointed out: "The essence of socialism is to liberate productive forces, develop productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity." This new definition of the essence of socialism highlights the decisive role of productive forces and the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, as well as the contradiction between economic base and superstructure, thus laying a theoretical foundation for the Party's fundamental task theory and primary task theory of socialism.
(5) Emphasizing seizing opportunities and developing oneself, the key is to develop the economy, and puts forward the important idea that "development is the hard truth". Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized: Now, some countries and regions around us are developing their economies faster than we are, and if we don't develop or develop too slowly, there will be problems when people make comparisons. So, if we can develop, we should not hinder it. In places where conditions permit, we should speed up development as much as possible, as long as we focus on benefits, quality, and develop an outward-oriented economy, there is nothing to worry about. The important thing is to seize opportunities. Our country's economic development must always strive to take another step every few years. Of course, it is not encouraging unrealistic high speed, but rather solid, efficient, and coordinated development. He made it clear: "For a developing country like ours, the economy needs to develop a little faster. It is impossible to always be calm and steady. We should pay attention to stable and coordinated development, but stability and coordination are relative, not absolute. Development is the hard truth." Developing the economy requires not only seizing opportunities, but also relying on science and education. Science should be promoted, and there is hope only by relying on science.
(6) Deng Xiaoping proposed that China should be vigilant against the right, but the main focus should be on preventing the "left" strategic estimation. Since the reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping has consistently fought against both the left and right erroneous tendencies, but he has repeatedly pointed out that the main focus is on combating the "left". He made it even clearer in the Southern Talk: "Now, there are influences from the right and the left, but the deeply rooted influences are from the 'left'. Some theorists and politicians scare people with big hats, not by the right, but by the 'left'. The 'left' carries a revolutionary color, as if the more 'left' the more revolutionary. The 'left' things have been terrible in our Party's history! Something good, but suddenly ruined by 'left' things. The right can bury socialism, and the 'left' can also bury socialism. China should be vigilant against the right, but the main focus is on preventing the 'left'." This thought-provoking conclusion is a profound summary of the Party's historical experience, the historical experience of other socialist countries, and the fresh experience of the main tendencies that have emerged since the reform and opening up. It has important guiding significance for our party to adhere to the basic line for 100 years without wavering and to maintain a clear mind in strategic estimation.
(7) It is proposed to adhere to the "two hands approach" and both hands must be firm. Deng Xiaoping, based on the lessons from the political turbulence in the 1980s, clearly pointed out: "We must adhere to the two hands approach, one hand for reform and opening up, and the other hand for cracking down on various criminal activities. Both hands must be firm. We cannot be weak in cracking down on various criminal activities and eliminating various ugly phenomena." In response to the goal of Guangdong catching up with the "Four Asian Tigers" in 20 years, he warned comrades in Guangdong that not only the economy should improve, but also the social order and social atmosphere should be improved. "Both cultural constructions must surpass theirs. This is the socialism with Chinese characteristics." He emphasized that corruption should be opposed throughout the entire process of reform and opening up. For cadres and Communist Party members, building a clean government should be a major task. It still depends on the rule of law, and we should rely more on the rule of law. As long as our productive forces develop and maintain a certain rate of economic growth, adhere to the "two hands approach", we can promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.
(8) Emphasizing that the correct political line must be guaranteed by the correct organizational line, the key to lasting stability of the country lies in the Communist Party itself. Deng Xiaoping stressed when implementing the transition of the party's new and old leadership collectives: "The key to China's problems is that the Communist Party must have a good Political Bureau, especially a good Standing Committee. As long as there are no problems with this link, China will be as stable as Mount Tai." "The most crucial thing is to have a united leadership core. If we can maintain this for fifty years, sixty years, socialist China will be invincible." In the southern tour speech, he further discussed this issue from the perspective of the relationship between the political line and the organizational line, pointing out: "Whether China's affairs can be done well, whether socialism and reform and opening up can be adhered to, whether the economy can develop faster, and whether the country can maintain lasting stability, to some extent, it depends on the people." We must pay attention to cultivating people and select people who are both virtuous and talented according to the standards of "revolutionization, youthfulness, knowledge, and specialization" into our leadership. Imperialism conducts peaceful evolution and places its hopes on the next few generations. Therefore, we must educate our army well, educate our dictatorship institutions well, educate our Communist Party members well, and educate our people and youth well. "If China were to have problems, it would still stem from within the Communist Party. We must remain clear on this issue... We say that the party's basic line must be in control for 100 years and must ensure lasting stability, and this relies on this aspect."
(9) Emphasizing the consolidation and development of the socialist system requires a long historical stage. Whether socialist society is a brief transitional period or a long historical era is a problem that has not been solved by Marx, Lenin, or Mao Zedong. Based on previous views, although socialism is also considered a lower stage of communism, the lack of understanding of the long-term nature of communism has led to a greater emphasis on the transitional nature of socialism. This is a theoretical root of the rush for success that all socialist countries have made. After experiencing the three-year "Great Leap Forward" in China, Mao Zedong also emphasized that socialism is a quite long historical period, but he mainly spoke from the perspective of class struggle. Deng Xiaoping summed up the historical lessons of socialist development and, with the strategic thinking of a politician and the profound vision of a historian, warned the entire party: "We have only been engaged in socialism for a few decades and are still in the primary stage. It will take a long historical stage, several generations, even several tens of generations of unremitting efforts for us to consolidate and develop the socialist system. We must not take it lightly."
(10) The essence of Marxism has been scientifically summarized, emphasizing the need to educate the youth in the understanding of the laws of human social development through historical materialism. Although Deng Xiaoping claimed to have read few books, he possessed abundant political wisdom and a high level of theoretical understanding. He made a scientific summary of the fundamental aspects of Marxism and pointed out: "Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Marxism. We should advocate this and not advocate textbooks. The success of our reform and opening up is not achieved through textbooks, but through practice, through seeking truth from facts." "We have been talking about Marxism for a lifetime, but in fact, Marxism is not mysterious. Marxism is something very down-to-earth, very plain." Based on this, he proposed that "when studying Marxism and Leninism, we must be meticulous and focus on practicality." He emphasized that Marxism is a science that uses historical materialism to reveal the laws of human social development, and more and more people in the world will support Marxism. After a long process of development, socialism will inevitably replace capitalism as the general trend of social historical development. Although some countries have experienced serious twists and setbacks that weakened socialism, the people, having undergone trials and tribulations, will learn from them and promote the development of socialism in a healthier direction. We must continue to advance along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "If in a hundred years from the founding of the People's Republic, we can develop our country into a moderately developed country, it will be remarkable! From now until the middle of the next century, it will be a crucial period, and we must work hard. The burden on our shoulders is heavy, and our responsibility is great!"
Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Speech is extremely rich in content. In a certain sense, it not only embodies the concentrated expression of Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on reform and opening up but also marks the development of his theoretical thinking reaching a new height. This is mainly manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, the Southern Tour Speech is a systematic work, not only discussing its content in a structured framework, providing comprehensive answers to many important questions such as what is socialism and how to build socialism, but also compared to his other works, it is a comprehensive theoretical document that forms a relatively complete system of personal thoughts. On the other hand, the Southern Tour Speech has given many new ideas to the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The above ten points are not only the new development of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics but also reflect the new realm it has reached. Not only does it have profound and insightful ideas, it also has a serious theoretical depth, and the language expression is also very distinct and thorough, with a fascinating sense of novelty. The Southern Talks are an important part of Deng Xiaoping's enrichment and development of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics in his later years, and it is also "another declaration of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts in advancing the reform, opening up and modernization to a new stage".
2. The preliminary establishment of Deng Xiaoping's theory and its guiding position
In mid-October 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held. The main tasks of the congress were: to take Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guide, comprehensively summarize the great practice and basic experience of reform and opening up over the past 14 years, determine the strategic deployment for the future period, seize favorable opportunities, accelerate the pace of reform, opening up and modernization, and achieve greater victory in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This congress made three decisions of far-reaching historical significance: first, the preliminary establishment of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guiding position of the whole Party; second, clarifying the goal of economic system reform in our country is to establish a socialist market economy system; and third, requiring the entire Party to seize opportunities, accelerate development, and focus on promoting economic construction. With Deng Xiaoping's Southern Talks and the 14th National Congress of the Party as the milestones, the cause of socialist reform, opening up and modernization entered a new stage of development.
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party has continuously enriched its understanding of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics in the practice of reform and opening up, gradually forming the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The formation of this theory mainly went through three stages of development:
The first stage was from the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the end of 1978 to the 12th National Congress of the Party in 1982. In the process of rectifying mistakes and starting reform, Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually took shape. Starting from the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of China earnestly rectified and corrected the past "left" mistakes, successfully completed the rectification of guiding ideology, and through the summary of historical experience and the practice of reform and opening up, re-established the correct combination of the basic principles of Marxism and the practice of socialist construction in China. In this process, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping, the Party put forward a series of new guidelines and policies on the construction of socialism in China, forming several new understandings about what socialism is and how to build socialism. The "Resolution on Several Historical Issues Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" in 1981 summarized these new understandings as ten main viewpoints, which can be regarded as the embryonic form of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the 12th National Congress of the Party, Deng Xiaoping proposed to "build socialism with Chinese characteristics", which enabled the Party to achieve a second historic leap in the sinicization of Marxism and gave clear thematic achievements to this leap.
The second stage was from the 12th National Congress of the Party in 1982 to the 13th National Congress of the Party in 1987. In the process of the comprehensive opening up of reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics formed its basic outline. The comprehensive opening up went through the process from rural reform to urban reform, from economic system reform to various other system reforms, and from revitalizing the domestic economy to opening up to the outside world. The deepening of reform urgently required theoretical guidance. During this period, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly raised the primary and fundamental theoretical question of understanding "what socialism is and how to build socialism". In October 1984, the Decision on Economic System Reform passed at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Party put forward that the socialist economy is a "planned commodity economy on the basis of public ownership", breaking through the traditional notion of opposing planned economy and commodity economy. In 1987, the 13th National Congress of the Party systematically expounded the theory of the primary stage of socialism. Together with the theory of socialist commodity economy, it has become one of the two major new achievements in the process of Marxist Sinicization, providing strong theoretical guidance for reform and opening up. The 13th National Congress of the Party highly evaluated the great significance of opening up and building a socialist path with Chinese characteristics since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, and referred to it as the second historical leap combining Marxism with Chinese practice, and named the theoretical achievements of this leap as "the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics". The 13th National Congress of the Party listed twelve major points of this theory, which are: (1) the view of liberating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and taking practice as the sole criterion for testing truth; (2) the view that the construction of socialism must be based on the national conditions and follow its own path; (3) the view that under the conditions of economic and cultural backwardness, the construction of socialism must go through a long primary stage; (4) the view that the fundamental task of socialist society is to develop productive forces and concentrate the forces to achieve modernization; (5) the view that the socialist economy is a planned commodity economy; (6) the view that reform is the important driving force for the development of socialist society, and opening up is a necessary condition for realizing socialist modernization; (7) the view that socialist democracy and socialist spiritual civilization are important features of socialism; (8) the view that the four fundamental principles must be combined with the general principle of adhering to reform and opening up, and they cannot be separated from each other; (9) the view that "one country, two systems" should be used to achieve national unity; (10) the view that the party's style of governance is related to the life and death of the Party; (11) the view that relations with foreign communist parties and other political parties should be developed based on the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs; (12) the view that peace and development are the themes of the contemporary world. "These points constitute the outline of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and they preliminarily answer the basic questions of the stage, tasks, driving forces, conditions, layout, and international environment of socialist construction in our country, and plan our scientific path of progress."
The third stage is from the 13th National Congress of the Party to the 14th National Congress of the Party, which is the stage for the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics by Deng Xiaoping to mature and form a scientific system. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, China's reform entered a critical stage, and serious political turmoil occurred both domestically and internationally. At this critical historical juncture, the Communist Party of China firmly relied on the people, resolutely adhered to the four cardinal principles, safeguarded the country's independence, security, and stability, unwaveringly adhered to the centrality of economic construction, and steadfastly promoted reform and opening up. The cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics not only successfully withstood severe tests, but the theory that guides this cause - Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics - has also been further improved.
In 1990, the 7th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party adopted the "Recommendations on Formulating the Ten-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the 'Eighth Five-Year Plan'", summarizing the basic principles and basic practices of building socialism with Chinese characteristics since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party as twelve principles. These twelve principles are: (1) Adhere to the system of people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants; (2) Uphold the development of social productive forces as the fundamental task of socialism; (3) Continuously improve the economic, political, and other management systems of socialism through reform; (4) Expand opening up to the outside world through various forms such as developing economic and trade relations, utilizing foreign capital, and introducing advanced technology; (5) Maintain a socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay and multiple economic components coexisting; (6) Actively develop a planned socialist commodity economy; (7) Implement a distribution system with remuneration according to work as the main form and other distribution methods as supplements; (8) Adhere to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, constantly improve the ideological, moral, scientific, and cultural qualities of the entire nation, and build a socialist spiritual civilization; (9) Establish and develop equal and mutually beneficial, united, and prosperous socialist ethnic relations, insisting on and improving the system of regional ethnic autonomy; (10) Promote the gradual realization of the great cause of national reunification in accordance with the concept and practice of "one country, two systems"; (11) Adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; (12) Adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party, continuously improve the Party's leadership system, style, and methods, and make the Party always the strong core of the socialist cause. Some of these principles have been consistently adhered to by the Party for decades, and there are new developments under new historical conditions; some are summaries of the fresh experiences in modernization construction and reform and opening up over the past decade, embodying Deng Xiaoping's outstanding contributions to inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. The summary of these twelve principles represents a further deepening of the understanding of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
In 1991, Jiang Zemin summarized the main content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics from the three aspects of economy, politics, and culture in his speech at the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Party. In early 1992, Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Talk further summarized the basic experiences since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, and profoundly answered many major issues that had long plagued and restricted people's thinking. This not only marked the elevation of Deng Xiaoping's thought to a new height but also brought the Party's understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to a new level. Based on these theoretical advancements, the Fourteenth National Congress of the Party summarized the content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics once again and for the first time used the term "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics".
The nine aspects that the Fourteenth National Congress summarized as "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics" are as follows:
(1) Regarding the issue of the socialist development path, emphasize the need to follow our own path, not take books as dogma, not mechanically copy foreign models, take Marxism as guidance, take practice as the sole criterion for testing truth, liberate thinking, seek truth from facts, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
(2) On the issue of the development stage, make the scientific judgment that our country is still in the primary stage of socialism, emphasizing that this is a very long historical stage of at least several hundred years. All guidelines and policies must be based on this basic national condition and not be divorced from reality or surpass the stage.
(3) On the issue of the fundamental task of socialism, point out that the essence of socialism is to liberate and develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eradicate polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity. The development of productive forces must be given top priority, with economic construction as the central task, and promote comprehensive social progress. The criterion for judging the success or failure of various tasks ultimately comes down to whether they are "favorable to" the three aspects.
(4) Regarding the issue of the driving force of socialist development, emphasize that reform is a revolution and the only way to liberate productive forces and achieve China's modernization. At the same time, emphasize that opening up to the outside world is an indispensable means for reform and construction. We should absorb and utilize all the achievements of advanced civilization created by countries including capitalist ones to develop socialism.
(5) On the issue of external conditions for socialist construction, it is pointed out that peace and development are the two major themes of the contemporary world. It is necessary to adhere to an independent and peaceful diplomatic policy to strive for a favorable international environment for our country's modernization construction.
(6) On the issue of political guarantees for socialist construction, it emphasizes the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles. It is not only a guarantee for the healthy development of reform, opening up, and modernization construction, but also needs to obtain new era content from reform, opening up, and modernization construction.
(7) On the issue of strategic steps, it is proposed that the basic realization of modernization should be done in three stages. It is necessary to allow and encourage some regions and some people to become prosperous through hard work, in order to gradually achieve common prosperity in more regions and among more people.
(8) On the issue of leadership and reliance, it emphasizes that the Communist Party is the leadership core of the socialist cause. The Party must adapt to the needs of reform, opening up, and modernization construction, continuously improve and strengthen its leadership in all aspects of work, and improve and strengthen its own construction. It must rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, the unity of all ethnic groups, and the broadest united front of all socialist workers, patriotic supporters of socialism, and patriotic supporters of national reunification.
(9) On the issue of national reunification, it proposes the creative idea of "one country, two systems" to promote the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
The summaries of the above nine aspects indicate that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has formed a relatively complete scientific system. The report of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that this scientific theoretical system has gradually formed and developed in the historical conditions where peace and development have become the main theme of the times, in the process of China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization construction, and based on summarizing the historical experiences of China's socialist victories and setbacks and learning from the historical experiences of success and failure of other socialist countries. The report highly evaluates the great significance of this theory and points out that it "for the first time systematically and preliminarily answers a series of basic questions about how to build socialism and how to consolidate and develop socialism in countries that are relatively economically and culturally backward like China, using new ideas and viewpoints, and inheriting and developing Marxism", "it is Marxism of contemporary China, a powerful ideological weapon that guides us to achieve new historical tasks".
In view of the theoretical significance and guiding role of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the strategic task of arming the whole Party with this theory, "learning Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought, with the central content being the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics". In the amended Party Constitution of the 14th National Congress, the great significance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is written into it, which preliminarily establishes its guiding position in the whole Party.
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, summarized and named by the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, is the first important theoretical achievement in which Marxism is combined with China's practice, and it is also the latest achievement of exploring Marxist sinicization since the reform and opening up. Based on it, the Communist Party of China has continuously summarized new experiences in reform, opening up, and modernization construction, and has achieved one theoretical innovation after another in the new century.
Chapter 7: The Socialist Market Economy System and the Basic Program of the Primary Stage of Socialism
I. The final establishment of the goal of market economy system reform and the formulation of action guidelines
The debate on how to reform China's economic system, whether it is to make adjustments within the existing planned economic system framework or to establish a new market economy system as the goal, has been accompanying the comprehensive progress of reform and opening up. It is both an economic problem and a political problem, which relates to the overall socialist modernization construction. The party has made unremitting explorations on this issue, which is a process of continuous ideological liberation and progressively clearer understanding. The previous discussion on the economic system reform decision made at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China partially touched on this issue. Here, we will review the ideological understanding of the central decision-making layer systematically.
As early as a certain meeting of the State Council held from July to September 1978, someone proposed that the role of the law of value should be exerted more. In December 1978, in the outline drafted by Deng Xiaoping for the speech "Liberate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, Unite as One, Look Forward" there was such a paragraph, "The contradiction between autonomy and state planning, mainly regulated by the law of value and supply-demand relationship (product quality)", that is, regulated through the market. This was Deng Xiaoping's initial expression of his thoughts on regulating economic activities through the market.
In March 1979, Chen Yun proposed in the "Outline on the Issue of Planning and Market", "During the entire socialist period, there must be two types of economies: (1) the planned economy part (planned and proportionate part); (2) the market-regulated part (that is, production not planned but based on changes in market supply and demand, a part that involves blind adjustment). The first part is the basic and primary part; the second part is the subordinate and secondary part but also necessary." He also pointed out, "In the future economic adjustment and system reform, adjusting the proportion between planning and market will account for a large proportion. It is not necessarily that the increase in the planned economy part will lead to an absolute decrease in the amount of the market economy part. It may very well increase correspondingly." Since then, the initiation and unfolding process of the reforms have proven Chen Yun's foresight. China's economic system reform did not break the framework of the planned system at the beginning. On the one hand, it focused on the role of the market and the law of value within the planned system, appropriately reducing the proportion of directive planning and increasing the proportion of guidance planning; on the other hand, it focused on expanding the scope of market regulation outside the planned system. In this way, both the guidance planning within the planned system and the market regulation outside the planned system increased, and the laws of the market were reflected both within and outside the planned system. Practice has proven that the importance of the market in economic development cannot be ignored, and a socialist economy cannot do without the regulatory role of the market. Deng Xiaoping provided a more explicit explanation of this, and he was the first to connect the market economy with socialism.
In November 1979, Deng Xiaoping pointed out during a meeting with foreign guests, "To say that a market economy only exists in capitalist society, that only capitalism has a market economy, is definitely incorrect. Why can't socialism have a market economy? This cannot be said to be capitalism. We are primarily a planned economy, but we also combine it with a market economy, which is a socialist market economy." Here, Deng Xiaoping explicitly used the term "socialist market economy". In June 1981, the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, passed at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, when summarizing the road of socialist modernization construction in our country, proposed to "give full play to the auxiliary role of market regulation." This term was confirmed as the principle of "planned economy as the mainstay and market regulation as the complement" in the report of the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. This reflects the level of understanding and recognition of this issue at that time.
The significant contribution of the Decision on Economic System Reform passed at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1984 was to resolve the issue of the unity between socialism and the commodity economy. However, it did not solve the problem of the unity between socialism and the market economy. The traditional notion that socialism cannot adopt a market economy still had a considerable influence. Nevertheless, when the Decision proposed that the socialist economy is "a planned commodity economy based on public ownership," it pointed out that implementing a planned economy does not mean relying solely on mandatory plans; indicative planning is also a concrete form of planning. This provided a theoretical basis for gradually reducing the scope of mandatory planning, continuously expanding the scope of market regulation, and promoting market-oriented reforms. The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further pointed out that "the new system of planned commodity economy under socialism should be a system in which planning and the market are intrinsically unified." Afterward, the term "planned economy as the mainstay" was no longer mentioned in central documents. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of an economic system and operational mechanism that combines planned economy and market regulation to adapt to the development of a planned commodity economy.
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, various regions have vigorously developed the commodity economy, and market-oriented reforms have been continuously expanding and deepening. At the same time, in terms of theory, there have been a series of debates on the nature of the market economy, whether China should implement a market economy, and other issues. The focus of the debate is whether a market economy should be associated with "socialism" or "capitalism." Deng Xiaoping made clear statements on this issue and reiterated the view that "there is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market economy" multiple times. He emphasized that it is necessary to understand theoretically that the difference between capitalism and socialism does not lie in whether it is a planned economy or a market economy. The following is a summary of Deng Xiaoping's multiple discussions on the market economy: In addition to the statement mentioned in November 1979, the second time was in January 1980 when discussing the search for a development path that conforms to China's reality in "The Current Situation and Tasks." It proposed combining "planned regulation and market regulation." The third time was in July 1982 when talking with officials from the National Development and Reform Commission. "Compared with capitalism, socialism's superiority lies in its ability to achieve overall coordination, concentrate resources, and ensure key points. The shortcomings lie in the inadequate use of the market and the lack of vitality in the economy. How to resolve the relationship between planning and the market? If resolved properly, it will be very beneficial to economic development. If not, it will be disastrous." The fourth and fifth times were evaluations of the Decision on Economic System Reform passed at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee. The fourth time was an impromptu speech given when the Decision was passed at the plenary session on October 20, 1984, stating that the Decision is the political economy combining Marxist basic principles with China's socialist practice. The fifth time was two days later when speaking at the Central Advisory Commission, stating that the Decision discussed new ideas that our ancestors had not discussed. The sixth time was during a conversation with a delegation of American entrepreneurs in October 1985, explicitly stating, "There is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market economy. The problem is how to develop productive forces more effectively. In the past, we have been implementing a planned economy, but many years of practice have proven that, in a sense, only implementing a planned economy will restrict the development of productive forces. Combining planned economy and market economy can better unleash productive forces and accelerate economic development." The seventh time was in February 1987 when talking with several senior officials of the central government, saying, "Why do people say that when we discuss the market, it's capitalism, and only planning is socialism? Planning and the market are both methods. As long as they benefit the development of productive forces, they can be used." It serves socialism, it is socialist; it serves capitalism, it is capitalist. It seems that talking about planning is socialism, but that is not correct. Japan also has a planning department, and the United States also has plans. We used to learn from the Soviet Union and implemented a planned economy. Later, we emphasized the primacy of planned economy, but now we no longer talk about it. The eighth time was in September 1988 when listening to an economic work report. It was said that macro-management should be reflected in the credibility of the central government. Now we are moving towards a moderately prosperous society. Although it does not directly involve planning and market issues literally, it is based on the implementation of a socialist market economy. Later, it emphasized the central macro-control under the conditions of a socialist market economy, which is an important authoritative basis. The ninth time was on June 9, 1989, in a speech: "We must continue to adhere to the combination of planned economy and market regulation, this cannot be changed. In practical work, during adjustment periods, we can strengthen or have more planning, and at another time, have more market regulation, making it more flexible." The tenth time was in December 1990, during a conversation with several responsible leaders of the central government: "We must understand in theory that the distinction between capitalism and socialism is not about whether it is planning or market. Socialism also has a market economy, and capitalism also has planned control. ... Don't think that engaging in a market economy means taking the capitalist road, it's not like that." The eleventh time was in early 1991 during an inspection in Shanghai: "Don't think that discussing a planned economy means socialism, or discussing a market economy means capitalism. It's not like that. Both are means, and the market can also serve socialism." The twelfth time is the Southern tour mentioned in the text. In the 1992 Southern tour, specifically addressing the debate about planning and market being "socialist" or "capitalist", Deng Xiaoping pointed out: whether there is more planning or more market is not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. Planned economy does not equal socialism, and capitalism also has planning; market economy does not equal capitalism, and socialism also has a market. Planning and market are both economic means. This provides a thorough and incisive answer to the long-standing theoretical question of whether socialism can conduct a market economy, fundamentally removing the ideological constraints that regard planned economy as the basic characteristic of socialism, and laying the ideological and theoretical foundation for establishing a socialist market economy system.
During the preparations for the 14th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee repeatedly studied and made decisions on establishing the goal model of economic system reform. On June 9, 1992, Jiang Zemin gave a report at the Central Party School, clearly putting forward the proposition of establishing a socialist market economy system. He first elaborated on Deng Xiaoping's idea that "socialism can also have a market". Through more than a decade of reform and opening up, we have gained a deeper understanding. In the past, we often only saw the negative impact of the spontaneity of the market, but seldom saw the positive role of the market in motivating enterprise competition and promoting economic development, especially in the way that the market also allocates resources and optimizes resource allocation. This is a one-sided understanding. Of course, emphasizing the advantages of the market does not mean that the market is comprehensive and omnipotent; the market also has obvious limitations. Therefore, it is also necessary to exploit the advantages of planned regulation to make up for and resist the negative effects of market regulation, in order to ensure the comprehensive development of the entire economy. He also pointed out: it is imperative to fundamentally reform the highly centralized planned economic system, otherwise it will be impossible to achieve modernization in our country. How to reform, what are the goals? He said that there are three approaches to establishing a new economic system: first, to establish a socialist commodity economic system that combines planning and the market; second, to establish a socialist planned market economic system; third, to establish a socialist market economic system. After soliciting opinions from various parties and making careful comparisons, the central committee "tends to use the term socialist market economic system". On June 12th, Jiang Zemin talked about his ideas to Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping immediately expressed his support for this approach and said that, in fact, we are already doing this and Shenzhen is a socialist market economy. Subsequently, the party committees of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities all expressed their agreement with the term socialist market economic system.
In the autumn of 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party formally proposed the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system. Jiang Zemin pointed out in the report of the 14th National Congress that the goal of China's economic system reform is to establish a socialist market economic system in order to further liberate and develop productive forces. The socialist market economic system to be established in China is meant to make the market play a fundamental role in resource allocation under the macro-control of the socialist state, to meet the requirements of the law of value in economic activities and adapt to changes in supply and demand. By utilizing the functions of price leverage and the competition mechanism, resources are allocated to sectors with better efficiency, and enterprises are given pressure and motivation to achieve the survival of the fittest. With the advantage of the market's sensitive response to various economic signals, timely coordination of production and demand is promoted. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that the market has its own weaknesses and negative aspects, and it is necessary to strengthen and improve the macro-control of the economy by the state. The report also points out that the socialist market economic system is combined with the basic socialist economic system. In terms of ownership structure, public ownership, including the economy under the ownership of the whole people and collective ownership, is the main body, while individual economy, private economy, and foreign-funded economy serve as supplements. Various economic components develop together in the long term, and different economic components can voluntarily practice various forms of joint operation. State-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, and other enterprises all participate in the market and exert the leading role of state-owned enterprises through equal competition. In terms of distribution system, the principle of distribution according to work is the mainstay, and other distribution methods serve as supplements, taking into account both efficiency and fairness. In terms of macro-control, the current interests of the people are combined with long-term interests, local interests are combined with overall interests, and the advantages of both planning and the market are better utilized. In March 1993, the first session of the 8th National People's Congress made amendments to the Constitution, changing "the country implements a socialist planned economy" to "the country implements a socialist market economy". The socialist market economy was written into the Constitution.
The establishment of the goal of the socialist market economic system marks a new leap in the Party's understanding of scientific socialist theory and the practice of reform and opening up. From the initial proposal of using the market's regulatory role as an auxiliary in the reform, to the establishment of the goal of a socialist market economic system at the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party, it took a total of 14 years. The final establishment of this goal is a major achievement of the Party's arduous exploration in the practice of reform and opening up and modernization construction, and it is also an inevitable result of the in-depth development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This new decision makes the direction of China's economic system reform and socialist modernization construction more clear.
According to the decisions of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee and the State Council are speeding up the advancement of various reforms while also actively formulating a general plan for establishing a socialist market economy. In November 1993, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System, which put forth a relatively complete vision and plan for how to establish a socialist market economic system. The Decision points out that the establishment of a socialist market economic system aims to enable the market, under the macroeconomic regulation of the state, to play a fundamental role in resource allocation, liberate and develop productivity to the maximum extent, enhance the overall national strength, rapidly improve people's living standards, and fully leverage the advantages of the socialist system. To achieve this goal, the Decision elaborates on five main aspects of establishing a socialist market economic system: first, adhering to the principle of the dominant position of public ownership and the common development of various economic sectors, further transforming the operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, and establishing modern corporate systems that are market-oriented, clear on property rights, accountable, with a clear separation between government and enterprises, and scientifically managed; second, establishing a nationwide unified and open market system, integrating urban and rural markets, connecting domestic markets with international markets, and promoting the optimized allocation of resources; third, transforming the government's function of economic management, establishing a sound macroeconomic regulation system primarily through indirect means to ensure the healthy operation of the national economy; fourth, establishing an income distribution system that prioritizes efficiency and fairness, with the principle of distribution based on work, encouraging certain regions and certain people to become prosperous first, and following the path of common prosperity; fifth, establishing a multi-level social security system that provides social security measures adapted to China's national conditions for urban and rural residents, and promoting economic development and social stability. These five aspects are the basic components of the initial construction of a socialist market economic system. These aspects are interconnected and mutually restrictive, forming an organic whole. The Decision consists of 50 articles and forms the overall framework for comprehensive reforms centered around the reform of the socialist market economic system.
At the closing session of the plenary session, Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Decision is based on the theory of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics" put forward by Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It further elaborates on the goals and basic principles of economic system reform, and represents the action plan for economic system reform undertaken by the Party in the 1990s. The Decision has preliminarily addressed how to integrate the basic socialist system with the market economic system and how to transform the old system into the new system. It will effectively promote the pace of reform in establishing a socialist market economic system and serve as a guide to establish the new system in a planned and step-by-step manner, laying a solid economic system foundation for China to reach the economic level of moderately developed countries by the middle of the 21st century.
II. The comprehensive implementation of the reform of the socialist market economic system
With the establishment of the goals for the reform of the socialist market economic system at the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China's reform and opening up has entered a new stage of overall transition from a planned economy to a market economy. After the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the central leadership collective led by Jiang Zemin continued to explore the path of deepening reform regarding the aforementioned basic aspects of the socialist market economic system, proposing important ideas and policies, and actively and steadily pushing forward the comprehensive reform of the market economic system. The most important aspects are as follows.
1. Actively promoting the reform of state-owned enterprises and establishing a modern corporate system
State-owned enterprises are the mainstay of China's national economy, and the reform of state-owned enterprises is the central task of economic system reform. The modern corporate system, with public ownership as the mainstay, is the foundation of the socialist market economy. The direction of reform of state-owned enterprises determined by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is to establish a modern corporate system. This is an inevitable requirement for the development of large-scale socialized production and the socialist market economy, and an effective manifestation of the combination of public ownership and the market economy. It signifies that the train of thought for China's economic system reform has shifted from policy adjustments focused on devolving power and granting benefits, tax and fee reforms, and separating powers and responsibilities in the past, to the stage of institutional innovation centered on the reform of the property rights system realized through public ownership. This is a huge change in the reform mindset and an important manifestation of the deepening of the reform. To this end, the central government has focused on the development of large and medium-sized enterprises, while also allowing for the revitalization of small state-owned enterprises, promoting the optimization and restructuring of state-owned assets through efforts to promote enterprise consolidation, reorganization, mergers, and bankruptcies. Starting from 1994, the State Council successively determined: firstly, to pilot the establishment of a modern enterprise system in 100 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; to pilot the optimization of capital structure and asset restructuring in 18 cities; to focus on key state-owned backbone enterprises related to national economy and people's livelihood; to develop enterprise groups that span regions, industries, and technology to trade combinations, and initially organize pilot projects for 56 enterprise groups. Extensive transformations into corporate and shareholding systems were carried out in the pilot enterprises, accumulating a lot of experience in establishing a modern enterprise system in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Various operating methods and organizational forms were adopted for small state-owned enterprises. By the end of 1993, nearly 4,000 enterprises had conducted shareholding pilot projects nationwide in accordance with standardized requirements. Laws and regulations on shareholding were gradually established. Shareholding became an effective way to transform enterprise management mechanisms and establish a modern enterprise system.
2. Cultivate and develop the market system, vigorously promote financial system and price system reforms
The key to establishing the socialist market economic system is to give full play to the fundamental role of the market mechanism in resource allocation, which requires the cultivation and development of the market system. While continuing to develop commodity markets, special attention should be given to the development of the means of production market, actively cultivating financial markets including bonds and stocks, and developing technology, labor, information, and real estate markets to quickly form a unified and open national market system. The significant breakthrough made in the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic System" (referred to as "the Decision") adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was the first mention of the "labor market". According to Marx's "Capital", labor power only becomes a commodity under the capitalist system. The practice of reform and opening-up has shown that in the primary stage of socialism, due to the existence of various forms of ownership, labor power still has a commodity nature and can create surplus value. The influx of a large number of rural migrant workers into urban employment constitutes a huge labor market. Recognizing the existence of the labor market that objectively exists can not only protect the legitimate rights and interests of laborers through labor laws but also promote the optimization allocation of labor resources. The "Decision" changed the usual term "labor service market" to "labor market," which is a significant ideological liberation.
The development of the market economy relies on financial markets, which play a central role. Shortly after the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee adopted the Decision on Economic System Reform, Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our banks used to be currency issuing companies, treasury houses, not real banks. The pace of financial reform should be accelerated. We must truly turn banks into banks." In the early 1990s, when talking about the development of Pudong, he also pointed out: "Finance is very important and is the core of a modern economy. If finance is well managed, the whole situation will be alive." Shanghai used to be a financial center and a place for free currency exchange, and will continue to be so in the future. In November 1990 and July 1992, authorized by the State Council and approved by the People's Bank of China, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges were established successively, realizing centralized trading of stocks and forming a national securities trading market. This also became an important symbol of the formation of China's capital market and financial system reform. Since 1994, China has gradually established a macroeconomic regulation and control system under the leadership of the State Council, with an independent central bank implementing monetary policy. It separates policy finance from commercial finance, establishes a financial organizational system with state-owned commercial banks as the main body and multiple financial institutions coexisting, and establishes a unified, open, competitively regulated financial market system. Subsequently, the exchange rate of the renminbi was aligned with the market exchange rate, and foreign exchange became freely convertible under current account transactions. A managed, single, floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand was established, which played an important role in further connecting domestic and foreign markets, improving the external economic environment, attracting foreign investment and developing an open economy.
The reform of the price management system was one of the earliest reforms initiated in the economic system reform, and it has been continuously adjusted. With consecutive years of abundant agricultural harvests and increasingly sufficient agricultural product supply, by 1993, the prices and operations of most agricultural products, including grain, had been liberalized, and the previous quantitative allocation of grain had been transformed into market supply. The ration coupons and grain certificates for urban residents were completely abolished. The prices of most production materials were unified from "dual-track prices" to a single market price. The proportion of market prices in the total retail sales of social commodities increased from 50.3% in 1991 to 93.8% in 1993, establishing the dominant position of market prices in the price system. During this period, economic means, legal means, and necessary administrative means were used, and an price control system mainly based on economic means was established. This marked the smooth progress of a major reform that was considered most likely to cause social disturbances. This is another major achievement of the reform and opening up.
3. Establishing and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control system, actively promoting fiscal and tax system and investment system reforms
The socialist market economy system established in China aims to better integrate planning and market mechanisms. The main task of macroeconomic regulation and control is to maintain the basic balance of the overall economic volume, promote the optimization of economic structure, guide the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and promote comprehensive social progress. The main economic methods used are to establish mechanisms for coordination and restraint among planning, finance, and fiscal systems, and to strengthen comprehensive coordination of economic operations.
Actively promoting fiscal and tax system reforms has been a key focus of establishing and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control system since the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In December 1993, the State Council decided to implement a separate tax system, dividing various incomes into fixed incomes for central finance, fixed incomes for local finance, and shared incomes between central and local finance. Correspondingly, the tax collection and management system was adjusted to establish regulated distribution relationships between central and local levels, ensuring the unified financial power and responsibilities of governments at all levels, gradually increasing the proportion of fiscal revenue to the gross domestic product (GDP), appropriately increasing the proportion of central fiscal revenue to enhance the capability of central macroeconomic regulation and control. At the same time, based on the principles of uniform tax law, fair tax burden, simplified tax system, and reasonable division of powers, the value-added tax was mainly implemented, transforming product taxes into consumption taxes, and imposing business taxes on the service industry. A progressive tax system for personal income tax was adopted, gradually forming a fair and competitive environment. Since 1997, further adjustments have been made to the tax policies of the financial and insurance industries, gradually aligning China's tax system with international rules.
Another important measure to strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control system is to actively promote the reform of the investment and financing system. This mainly involves further strengthening the dominant position of enterprises in investment and financing, and introducing more market competition mechanisms in investment and financing. The system of capitalization is implemented for various operating fixed asset investment projects, and the construction of investment projects must be carried out after the capitalization is implemented. Various financing methods have been introduced in the infrastructure, basic industries, and public utilities' infrastructure construction, extensively absorbing funds from all walks of society and promoting investment and financing to achieve the maximum economic and social benefits.
4. Deepen the reform of the foreign trade system and establish an operating mechanism that adapts to the international economic rules.
To establish a socialist market economic system, it is necessary to fully utilize both the international and domestic markets and resources. This requires regulating foreign economic activities and deepening the reform of the foreign trade system. At that time, three measures were mainly taken.
First, the mandatory planned import for foreign trade was canceled and replaced with a guiding plan. For goods needed for domestic production, construction, and market demand, enterprises organize imports on their own based on market conditions, reducing the number of quota goods and regulating the management methods of imported quota goods. Second, enterprises that meet the conditions are granted import and export operating rights, changing the status of lag in the transformation of foreign trade enterprise operating mechanisms, improving their adaptability to the increasingly fierce international market competition, and cultivating and expanding a group of large foreign trade enterprises with international competitiveness. Third, combining international practices to improve foreign trade laws and regulations, and accelerate the integration of the foreign trade system with international standards, while reducing the overall tariff level. Starting from April 1, 1996, the overall tariff level for more than 4,000 imported goods was reduced to 23%, and it was further reduced to around 17% by October 1, 1997. These measures not only help more competitive foreign goods enter the Chinese market but also promote China's economic development and accelerate its entry into the World Trade Organization.
The transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy can be described as "crossing the river by feeling the stones." This cannot be criticized. Without experience, opening up a path can only be done in this way. This is the practice theory of Marxism. Through the aforementioned reforms and other reforms, this difficult transition has been basically achieved, and the marketization and socialization of the national economy have significantly improved, and economic vitality has noticeably increased. All of this has created favorable conditions for the continued improvement and perfection of the socialist market economic system.
III. The critical moment in the historical development and the grand banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory held high
After Deng Xiaoping passed away on February 19, 1997, whether the Communist Party of China could continue to hold high the grand banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and whether China's reform, opening up, and modernization construction could continue to advance along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics opened up by Deng Xiaoping became a major issue of concern for the entire party, the whole nation, and the world's attention. The Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core gave a clear answer to this key question concerning the overall development of China. This is: inheriting Deng Xiaoping's will, holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and resolutely advancing along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Deng Xiaoping.
The "Letter to the Party, the Army, and the People of All Ethnic Groups in the Country" issued by the Central Committee and the eulogy by Jiang Zemin at the memorial service for Deng Xiaoping highly evaluated Deng Xiaoping's magnificent revolutionary career of more than seventy years and his immortal contributions to the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation and the socialist modernization of China. The eulogy emphasized that the most precious wealth left to us by Deng Xiaoping is the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that he established and the basic line of the Party formulated under the guidance of this theory. This is the action guide that must be followed. Raising the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics even higher on the new journey of the new century, better implementing the Party's basic line, is the firm determination and belief of our Party's central leadership collective, as well as the consensus and desire of the whole Party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups.
On May 29th, Jiang Zemin delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of the provincial and ministerial-level advanced studies class at the Central Party School, once again emphasizing the issue of holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. He said that in the new era of socialist reform, opening up and modernization, and on the new journey across the new century, we must hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide our entire cause and all our work. This is an unshakable conclusion drawn by the Party from history and reality. The issue of the banner is crucial. The banner is the direction, and the banner is the image. We must have a high degree of consciousness and firmness on this issue, and we must not waver no matter what difficulties or risks we encounter.
In September 1997, the 15th National Congress of the Party was held, and Jiang Zemin delivered the report titled "Hold High the Great Banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comprehensively Advance the Construction of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics to the 21st Century." The report, from a historical perspective, discussed the great changes in the Chinese nation over a century, pointing out that our nation has experienced three historic and enormous changes in the 20th century, producing three great leaders at the forefront of the times: Sun Yat-sen, who led the 1911 Revolution and overthrew the autocratic system that had ruled China for thousands of years; Mao Zedong, who led the victory of the new democratic revolution, the establishment of New China, and the socialist system; and Deng Xiaoping, who led the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization construction, which is known as the new great revolution. The third historic and enormous change has successfully opened up a new path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics for achieving the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the prosperity of the country, and the happiness of the people. The exuberance and vitality of socialism in China have attracted worldwide attention. Deng Xiaoping's great contributions to China and the world have received sincere respect and admiration from the Chinese people and peoples around the world.
The report of the 15th National Congress of the Party further expounded the historical position of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and for the first time used the term "Deng Xiaoping Theory". Jiang Zemin pointed out: The Communist Party of China attaches great importance to theoretical guidance. The Communist Party of China, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, has integrated it with Chinese reality and achieved two historic leaps, producing two major theoretical achievements. The main creator of the first leap is Mao Zedong, and our Party calls it Mao Zedong Thought. "The main creator of the second leap is the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and its main creator is Deng Xiaoping, and our Party calls it Deng Xiaoping Theory." The report of the 15th National Congress of the Party stated when evaluating the historical position of Deng Xiaoping's theory: Deng Xiaoping Theory is "the correct theory that guides the Chinese people to achieve the socialist modernization in the victory of the reform and opening up. In contemporary China, only the theory of Deng Xiaoping, which combines Marxism with the practice and characteristics of contemporary China, can solve the problems facing socialism. Deng Xiaoping Theory is the Marxism of contemporary China and represents a new stage of Marxist development in China.
The report points out that Deng Xiaoping Theory has become a new stage of the development of Marxism in China for the following reasons: First, Deng Xiaoping Theory insists on liberating the mind, seeking truth from facts, inheriting from predecessors, breaking new ground on the basis of new practices, and opening up new horizons for Marxism. Second, Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the basic achievements of scientific socialism theory and practice, grasps the fundamental questions of "what is socialism and how to build socialism," profoundly reveals the essence of socialism, and raises the understanding of socialism to a new scientific level. Third, Deng Xiaoping Theory adopts a broad Marxist perspective to observe the world, conducts correct analysis of the modern era's characteristics and the overall international situation, the success and failure of other socialist countries, the gains and losses of developing countries in seeking development, and the development trends and contradictions of developed countries, making new scientific judgments. Fourth, Deng Xiaoping Theory is a scientific system of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually formed and developed based on the historical conditions of peace and development becoming the theme of the times, the practice of reform, opening up, and modernization in our country, and the summary of the historical experience of socialist construction in our country and lessons from the rise and fall of other socialist countries. This theory systematically answers a series of essential questions about the development path, stages, fundamental tasks, driving forces, external conditions, political guarantees, strategic steps, party leadership and support, national reunification, etc. of Chinese socialism, and guides our party in formulating the basic line in the primary stage of socialism. It is a comprehensive scientific system that encompasses philosophy, political economy, scientific socialism, and other fields, covering aspects such as economy, politics, science and technology, education, culture, ethnicity, military, foreign affairs, united front, and party building. Therefore, Jiang Zemin said, "The soul of our congress is to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory."
"In contemporary China, Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory form a unified scientific system. Upholding Deng Xiaoping Theory means genuinely upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory means genuinely holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." The amendment to the Party Constitution adopted by the congress further established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the party and explicitly stipulated that the Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory as its action guide.
The congress also provided new interpretations and summaries of the theory of the primary stage of socialism, which is considered the foundational theory of Deng Xiaoping Theory, enriching and developing the theory first expounded at the 13th National Congress of the Party. This mainly includes the following points: 
(1) It is the first time to explicitly state that our country will remain in the primary stage of socialism for a long period. The comprehensive reform has entered the stage of tackling difficulties, facing numerous contradictions and difficulties, and new doubts need to be clarified. This leads to a further understanding of China's national conditions, the firm belief in the party's basic line and basic policies at the current stage. Only with a correct understanding of the basic national conditions can we believe in why we must implement the current line and policies and not adopt other lines and policies. The report clearly states, "We must proceed from reality in all our work, and the biggest reality is that China is now in and will remain in the primary stage of socialism for a long time. To understand 'what is socialism and how to build socialism,' we must understand what socialism in the primary stage is and how to build socialism in this stage." It is precisely for this reason that the 15th National Congress of the Party once again emphasized the issue of the primary stage of socialism and reinterpreted this theory.
(2) In discussing the definition of the content and characteristics of the primary stage of socialism, we have reached a new height in addressing the questions of "what is socialism and how to build socialism". "What is socialism and how to build socialism" is a fundamental question that Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized based on China's historical experiences. After the publication of Volume 3 of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" in November 1993, the whole Party engaged in studying and discussing this fundamental question, raising the understanding of socialism to a new level. The important characteristic highlighted by the 15th National Congress of the Party regarding the primary stage of socialism is the analysis of the question from this standpoint, which provides a more profound understanding. From this standpoint, the analysis of the content and characteristics of the primary stage of socialism emphasizes that it is a dynamic process of continuous improvement and transformation from one state to another. The 13th National Congress of the Party outlined five basic characteristics of the primary stage. The 15th National Congress of the Party reexamined these characteristics based on new experiences, expanding them into a comprehensive list of nine aspects, including general features, the development of material civilization, the development of spiritual civilization, and the development of political civilization. The summary provided by the 15th National Congress of the Party regarding the basic characteristics of the primary stage of socialism is as follows: The primary stage of socialism is a historical stage characterized by gradually overcoming underdevelopment and achieving the basic modernization of socialism. It is a historical stage in which a predominantly agricultural country with a large rural population and predominantly manual labor gradually transforms into an industrialized country with a majority of non-agricultural population, including modern agriculture and modern service industry. It is a historical stage in which a predominantly natural economy and a semi-natural economy gradually transform into a highly market-oriented economy. It is a historical stage in which a population with a significant illiteracy and semi-literacy rate and backwardness in science, technology, education, and culture gradually transforms into a state with relatively developed science, technology, education, and culture. It is a historical stage in which a population with a significant poverty rate and a low standard of living gradually transforms into a state where the entire population is relatively prosperous. It is a historical stage in which economic and cultural imbalances between regions gradually narrow through development that occurs in certain regions before others. It is a historical stage in which, through reform and exploration, a relatively mature and dynamic socialist market economy system, socialist democratic political system, and other systems are established and improved. It is a historical stage in which the broader population firmly establishes the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, strengthens self-reliance, strives for progress, works diligently and frugally, and simultaneously develops material civilization and spiritual civilization. It is a historical stage in which the gap with the world's advanced level gradually narrows, and on the basis of socialism, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is achieved.
(3) According to the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's speeches in the southern tour, the primary stage of socialism is affirmed to require at least 100 years. The contradiction between the increasing material and cultural needs of the people, which is the main contradiction in society, and the backwardness of social productive forces will "penetrate the entire process and all aspects of social life in our country during the primary stage of socialism". Only by firmly grasping this main contradiction "can we observe and grasp the overall situation of social contradictions clearly and effectively promote the resolution of various social contradictions", thereby providing a more solid foundation for the statement that "development is the key to solving all problems, and China must rely on its own development".
(4) For the first time, the relationship between "reform, development, and stability", which was proposed after the 14th National Congress of the Party, was included and emphasized within the historical framework of the primary stage of socialism. This not only clarifies the strategic position of handling this relationship in the overall construction of socialist modernization but also further establishes it as a long-term basic policy applicable to the entire primary stage of socialism. This has improved the understanding of the status of the relationship between "reform, development, and stability" and enriched the basic issues that should be grasped during the primary stage of socialism.
The 15th National Congress of the Party's reinterpreted theory on the primary stage of socialism not only makes this fundamental theory of Deng Xiaoping's more in line with the spirit of the times but also provides the theoretical basis for the third-generation leadership to propose a basic outline for the primary stage of socialism.
IV. The formation of the basic outline of the primary stage of socialism.
The 15th National Congress of the Party, based on Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line, focused on the goal of building a prosperous, democratic, civilized socialist modern country, and proposed the Party's basic program for the primary stage of socialism in a comparatively complete manner for the first time. If it can be said that the clear summary of the Party's basic line after the first exposition of the theory of the primary stage of socialism is a major theoretical contribution of the 13th National Congress of the Party, then the clear proposal of the Party's basic program in this period at a new height when re-expounding the issue of the primary stage of socialism is a major theoretical contribution of the 15th National Congress of the Party.
The Party's understanding of the basic program for the primary stage of socialism has also gone through an exploration process. As early as 1979, Ye Jianying, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, proposed the goal of comprehensive modernization in his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of New China. This is also what Deng Xiaoping reiterated in his subsequent speeches: "Our country has entered a new period of socialist modernization. We must significantly increase social productive forces, reform and improve the socialist economic and political systems, develop highly democratic socialism and a complete socialist legal system. We must simultaneously develop a high level of material civilization, improve the scientific and cultural level of the whole nation, develop a noble and diverse cultural life, and build a highly advanced socialist spiritual civilization." Since then, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized that there are many tasks in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and we must adhere to the comprehensive development and progress of socialist society under the precondition of economic construction, without neglecting one for the other. For this reason, he proposed a series of "dual-track" strategic thinking and policies, demanding that during the entire process of reform, opening up, and modernization, we must both promote reform and opening up and crack down on crime, both promote economic construction and advance democracy and the rule of law, both promote material civilization and spiritual civilization. He stressed the need to "grasp both tracks and be equally strong in both". Therefore, Deng Xiaoping Theory is a theory of the comprehensive construction and comprehensive development of the economic, political, and cultural aspects of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
At the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Party Central Committee, Jiang Zemin pointed out that for the line and a series of basic policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we must be firm and unwavering, and comprehensively implement and consistently adhere to them. In December 1990, the Recommendations of the 7th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party on Formulating the Ten-year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" put forward several principles for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, involving various aspects such as the economy, politics, and culture. On July 1, 1991, in his speech at the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Party, Jiang Zemin made a relatively systematic summary of the basic content of the economy, politics, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics in accordance with Mao Zedong's discussion on the new democratic revolution. He pointed out:
(1) To build the economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must adhere to the socialist public ownership of the means of production as the mainstay, allow and encourage the development of other economic sectors appropriately, not go for a single public ownership system that is detached from the level of productivity development, and not undermine the leading position of the public ownership economy, and must not privatize. We must establish a distribution system with remuneration according to work as the main form and other forms as supplements, overcoming egalitarianism and preventing polarization, and gradually realize common prosperity for all the people. We must establish an economic system and operational mechanism that adapts to the development of the socialist planned commodity economy, combines planning with market regulation, and plays a positive role in market regulation under the guidance of state laws, regulations, and plans. We must overcome the drawbacks of excessive centralization and over-regulation in the past, but must not overly decentralize and weaken macro-control.
(2) To build the political system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and must not weaken or abandon the people's democratic dictatorship. We must adhere to and improve the system of people's congresses and must not adopt the Western parliamentary system. We must adhere to and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and must not weaken or negate the leadership of the Communist Party, and must not adopt the Western multi-party system.
(3) To build a culture with Chinese socialist characteristics, we must be guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and not engage in the diversification of guiding ideologies. We must adhere to the direction of serving the people and serving socialism, as well as the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. We should promote and develop socialist culture, and not allow the proliferation of anything that harms the people, contaminates socialism, or opposes socialism. We must inherit and carry forward the fine cultural traditions of our nation, while fully embodying the spirit of the socialist era. We should base ourselves on our own country, while also absorbing the outstanding achievements of world culture. We must not engage in cultural nihilism or complete westernization. Jiang Zemin emphasized that "the economic, political, and cultural aspects of socialism with Chinese characteristics are an organic whole and inseparable." We must firmly grasp the basic requirements for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the economic, political, and cultural aspects.
Since Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Speech in 1992 and the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, our country has achieved new significant accomplishments in economic, political, and cultural development, and the content of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in these aspects has become richer. Based on this foundation, the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, building on the theoretical content of building socialism with Chinese characteristics summarized by the 14th National Congress led by Deng Xiaoping, further summarized the experience in the economic, political, and cultural aspects of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made more insightful explanations on what is socialism with Chinese characteristics in the primary stage, and how to build such an economy, politics, and culture. It formally put forward the party's basic program for the primary stage of socialism. This basic program, revolving around the party's basic line and the goal of socialist modernization, puts forward requirements and tasks in the economic, political, and cultural aspects.
(1) "Building a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics" means developing a market economy under the conditions of socialism, and continuously liberating and developing productive forces. This requires adhering to and improving the basic economic system with socialist public ownership as the mainstay and the common development of diverse forms of ownership; adhering to and improving the socialist market economy system, allowing the market to play a fundamental role in resource allocation under the macro-control of the state; adhering to and improving various distribution methods with remuneration based on labor as the mainstay, allowing some regions and some people to become prosperous first so as to drive and help those who are not wealthy, gradually achieving common prosperity; and adhering to and improving opening up to the outside world, actively participating in international economic cooperation and competition, ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and allowing the people to share the fruits of economic prosperity. The notion of "developing a market economy under the conditions of socialism, and continuously liberating and developing productive forces" is a new addition based on the summary of Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Speech. It is taken as a fundamental characteristic of building a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics, highlighting a new understanding of the essential requirements of socialism and new approaches to achieving these requirements. It helps us grasp the most essential aspects of building a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics. The report also provides a clearer and more comprehensive explanation of the basic economic system, market economy system, various distribution methods, and opening up to the outside world, which are related to how to build such an economy. The content in the part of the report on economic system reform and development strategy is, in fact, a specific elaboration of building a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics. It breaks through long-standing traditional concepts on a series of issues and further reflects the requirements for developing the economy in the primary stage of socialism.
(2) "Building a socialist political system with Chinese characteristics" means, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and based on the people being the masters of the country, governing the country according to law and developing socialist democracy. This requires adhering to and improving the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants; adhering to and improving the system of people's congresses and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as the system of regional ethnic autonomy, promoting democracy, improving the legal system, and building a socialist rule of law state. It aims to achieve social stability, clean and efficient government, unity and harmony among all ethnic groups, and a lively political situation. Compared to the content of the speech in July 1991, it emphasizes the overall requirement of "governing the country according to law and developing socialist democracy". In the enumerated basic political systems, the system of ethnic regional autonomy has been added, which is very necessary and in line with the characteristics of our multi-ethnic country in terms of political systems. Since then, the party literature has mentioned that this is a fundamental political system in the current stage of our country. It also adds the requirement of "building a socialist rule of law country" and "clean and efficient government", reflecting both the desires of the broad masses of the people and the efforts the party needs to make to achieve the goal of democratic politics. Taking these two points as the content of building a socialist political system with Chinese characteristics embodies a major progress in the party's democratic and rule of law ideology.
(3) "Building a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics" means, guided by Marxism, aiming to cultivate citizens with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, developing a socialist culture that is modern, global, future-oriented, national, scientific, and popular. This requires persistently arming the whole party and educating the people with Deng Xiaoping Theory, striving to improve the ideological and moral qualities and educational, scientific, and cultural levels of the entire nation, adhering to the direction of serving the people and socialism, promoting diversity and vigorous academic and artistic activities. It is about building a socialist spiritual civilization that is based on the reality of China, inherits the excellent traditions of history and culture, and absorbs the beneficial achievements of foreign cultures. The content here is based on the speech from July 1991 and has absorbed the new achievements of the resolution on strengthening the construction of socialist spiritual civilization in the sixth plenary session of the 14th Central Committee of the Party in October 1996, thus deepening the understanding. In order to answer concisely and comprehensively what is Chinese socialism with distinctive characteristics, the aforementioned passage "guided by Marxism, aiming to cultivate citizens with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, developing a socialist culture that is modern, global, future-oriented, national, scientific, and popular" integrates Deng Xiaoping's ideology, encompasses various requirements, and highlights the characteristic of keeping pace with the times. In order to achieve this goal, the "how to build" aspects mentioned, including the requirements of building a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics for the construction of spiritual civilization.
The above basic goals and policies for building the economy, politics, and culture with Chinese characteristics constitute the Party's basic program for the primary stage of socialism. Jiang Zemin pointed out in the report to the 15th National Congress of the Party: "This program is an important content of Deng Xiaoping Theory, representing the unfolding of the Party's basic line in the fields of the economy, politics, and culture and serving as a scientific summary of the main experiences of these years." The proposal of this basic program has important guiding significance for unifying the thinking of the whole Party and uniting people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to strive for the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Chapter 8: Developing Socialist Democracy and Building Socialist Spiritual Civilization with Chinese Characteristics
I. Actively promoting the construction of socialist democracy
The construction of democratic politics is an important part of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. After entering the new stage of reform and opening up, the Party Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin as the core, deepened its understanding of China's national conditions and the changing situation, and adopted more practical measures to promote political system reform and build a socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics, achieving fruitful results in institutional construction and other aspects.
1. The proposal of the guideline "actively and steadily promote political system reform"
Deng Xiaoping was the chief designer of reform and opening up and modernization construction, as well as the chief designer of political system reform. In his speeches, he clearly stated the fundamental goals and overall framework of political system reform in China. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Party Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin as the core, consistently adhered to Deng Xiaoping's ideas on political system reform and further proposed the guideline of "actively and steadily promoting political system reform". In July 1995, Jiang Zemin pointed out, "While implementing economic system reforms, we actively and steadily promote political system reforms and strive to build a socialist democratic political system with Chinese characteristics." In his speech at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 1998, he continued to emphasize, "We must actively and steadily promote political system reforms. This is an inherent requirement for the self-improvement and development of our socialist political system, and it is also an important decision made by our Party based on the summary of historical and practical experiences." This decision is a fundamental guideline of great significance in the course of China's political system reform and development.
The guideline of "actively and steadily promoting political system reforms" has two implications. Firstly, political system reforms continue to progress without interruption, despite accusations from some domestic and foreign sources regarding political disputes. As stated in the report of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "We actively promote political system reforms, giving significant development to socialist democracy and the establishment of the rule of law." Following this, the Communist Party of China has made tremendous efforts to strengthen the basic political system, improve democratic centralism, and enhance the scientific and democratic mechanisms for decision-making, as well as to strengthen grassroots democracy construction. Therefore, claims that political system reforms in China have stalled are unfounded. Secondly, the basic guideline for promoting political system reforms is to do so "actively and steadily." The term "actively" means that political system reforms must not cease and must advance with a positive attitude. Particularly when the economic system reforms enter a critical stage and the socialist market economy system needs further improvement, political system reforms must be adapted accordingly. As the economic system reforms deepen, the defects in certain specific leadership systems and work mechanisms will become institutional barriers to economic and social development. Jiang Zemin pointed out in June 2000 that in order to achieve a relatively perfect new socialist market economy system, a series of deep-rooted problems need to be resolved, including "the government's management system and operation mechanism, as well as the leadership system of the Party and the country, which all require deeper reforms to further improve and enhance." Regarding systemic innovation, "it is necessary to continuously improve various aspects of the system that are in line with the requirements of developing a socialist market economy and comprehensively constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics." The term "steadily" is used because political system reforms are an extremely complex undertaking with great difficulties. According to Deng Xiaoping, even until the mid-1980s, "we still hadn't completely figured it out". "This issue is very difficult, each reform involves a wide range of people and matters, it is profound, and touches the interests of many individuals. It will encounter many obstacles, so it needs to be approached with caution... Our country is so large, the situation is so complex, and reforms are not easy. Therefore, decision-making must be careful." Jiang Zemin pointed out in the report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "The construction of a socialist democratic politics is an incremental historical process that needs to be approached step by step and in an orderly manner, taking into account our national conditions and under the leadership of the Party." Therefore, political system reforms cannot be rushed and can only be pursued with an "active and steady" approach.
Based on Deng Xiaoping's overall goals for political system reform and the specific requirements of "figuring it out", further integrate and advance the train of thought for political system reforms. Jiang Zemin stated in the report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "At present and in the future, the main tasks of political system reform are: developing democracy, strengthening the rule of law, implementing the separation of government and enterprises, streamlining institutions, improving the system of democratic supervision, and maintaining stability and unity." In April 2001, he proposed six principles for advancing political system reforms:
(1) Reform the leadership system of the Party and the state, not to weaken the leadership of the Party, but to strengthen and improve it. To be conducive to consolidating the socialist system, to be conducive to consolidating the leadership of the party, and to be conducive to the development of social productive forces under the leadership of the party and the socialist system.
(2) The goal of reform is to always maintain the vitality of the party and the country, overcome bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, expand grassroots democracy, and mobilize the enthusiasm of grassroots workers, farmers, and intellectuals.
(3) Persistently strengthen and improve internal party democracy to continuously promote the development of people's democracy.
(4) The success of reform depends on whether the country's political situation is stable, whether it can enhance the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, improve people's lives, and whether productive forces can achieve sustained development.
(5) We must not discard the superiority of our socialist system and should not adopt the so-called Western democracy system. The content and steps of reform should be determined based on our own practices and circumstances.
(6) Political system reform is very complex, and every measure involves the interests of millions of people. It should be carried out in a step-by-step, orderly manner under leadership.
These principles have made the thinking for promoting political system reform along a positive, prudent, and correct path increasingly firm and clear.
2. Improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
The system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is a basic political system of our country and an important aspect of political system reform. In 1987, when the 13th National Congress of the Party put forward the task of political system reform, it proposed to improve the "system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China."
After the 13th National Congress of the Party, members of the democratic parties in Beijing and non-party members put forward their views and opinions on the issue of "multi-party cooperation." In early January 1989, Deng Xiaoping commented after reading: "An ad hoc group can be organized (with members from democratic parties), specifically to formulate a plan for the participation and supervision responsibilities of members of the democratic parties, to be completed within a year, and to be implemented starting next year." According to Deng Xiaoping's instructions, the ad hoc group consisted of leaders of the democratic parties and officials from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, and other relevant departments. After more than a year of efforts, the drafting work was completed. In February 1990, the People's Daily published the "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Adhering to and Improving the System of Multi-Party Cooperation and Political Consultation under the Leadership of the Communist Party of China" (referred to as the "Opinions"), making provisions on various issues.
(1) Regarding the form of political consultation. "Opinions" summarize the effective experience between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and propose the following forms of consultation: First, the main leaders of the Communist Party of China should invite the main leaders of the democratic parties and representatives of non-party individuals to hold high-level, small-scale talks as needed, freely discussing common concerns, exchanging ideas, and seeking opinions. Second, the Communist Party of China should hold symposiums for the democratic parties and non-party individuals, briefing or exchanging important information, conveying important documents, and listening to policy suggestions or discussions on certain topics proposed by the democratic parties and non-party individuals. Third, in addition to conference consultations, the democratic parties and non-party individuals can submit written policy suggestions to the Communist Party of China on major issues concerning the national political direction and modernization construction, or invite responsible leaders of the Communist Party of China for direct conversations.
(2) Regarding the role of democratic parties in the People's Congress. "Opinions" stipulate that members of democratic parties and non-party individuals should account for an appropriate proportion among national deputies, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and members of the specialized standing committees, and qualified members of democratic parties and non-party individuals with corresponding expertise can be hired as advisors to the specialized standing committees. People's Congress at the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality levels should ensure that members of democratic parties and non-party individuals account for an appropriate proportion. In the People's Congress at the city, prefecture, and county levels, the proportion of non-party individuals should be ensured. For cities, prefectures, and counties with democratic party organizations, members of democratic parties should account for an appropriate proportion in the People's Congress.
(3) Regarding the appointment of members of democratic parties and non-party individuals to leadership positions in various levels of government and judicial institutions. "Opinions" suggest taking practical measures to select and assign members of democratic parties and non-party individuals to leadership positions in the State Council and its relevant ministries and commissions, as well as county-level and higher local governments and their relevant departments. Qualified members of democratic parties and non-party individuals should be elected to leadership positions in procuratorate and judicial organs. A group of qualified democratic party members and non-party individuals with specialized knowledge should be appointed as special inspectors, prosecutors, auditors, and education supervisors. Members of democratic parties and non-party individuals can participate in the investigation of major cases organized by government supervisory, auditing, industrial and commercial departments, as well as inspections related to taxation.
(4) Regarding the role of democratic parties in the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC should become an important place for parties, people's organizations, and representatives from all sectors to unite, cooperate, and participate in political consultation. "Opinions" explicitly stipulate that in various meetings of the CPPCC, the freedom to criticize and express different opinions should be effectively guaranteed for CPPCC members. Democratic parties and non-party individuals should be assured a certain proportion among members of the CPPCC Standing Committee and CPPCC leadership. Democratic party members and non-party individuals should participate in the specialized committees of the CPPCC, and a certain number of democratic party members and non-party individuals should hold full-time leadership positions in the CPPCC organs, truly possessing duties, powers, and responsibilities.
The purpose of the Communist Party of China's formulation of this "Opinion" is to further enhance the role of democratic parties in political consultation and democratic supervision. In accordance with this requirement, "Opinions" specify a series of issues regarding the democratic parties' political consultation: firstly, the purpose of participating in political consultation is clearly stated; secondly, the differences between the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China and the multi-party system in the West are clearly pointed out; thirdly, the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties is clearly defined; fourthly, the basic principles of cooperation between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties are further clarified; fifthly, the basic points of the democratic parties' political consultation are indicated; sixthly, the general principles for the democratic parties to exercise supervisory roles are specified; seventhly, the activity guidelines for the democratic parties are regulated.
This "Opinion" is a summary of the positive and negative experiences of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China through long-term revolutionary and construction practices. In terms of practice, it is a sign of the institutionalization and standardization of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. In terms of theory, it enriches and develops the theory of Marxist party relations by summarizing the long-term cooperation between the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties. The formulation and implementation of this "Opinion" is an important step in promoting political system reform and strengthening the construction of socialist democratic politics. It has significant and far-reaching implications for fully leveraging the advantages of the socialist system led by the Communist Party of China and developing socialist democratic politics. In December 2000, Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech at the national united front work conference, "The system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party is the crystallization of the political experience and wisdom of the Chinese people. The prominent feature of our political system lies in the leadership of the Communist Party, the cooperation of multiple parties, the Communist Party in power, and the participation of multiple parties in politics. The democratic parties are not opposition parties or parties outside the government, but friendly parties and participating parties that closely cooperate with the Communist Party. The Communist Party and the democratic parties engage in democratic consultation and scientific decision-making on major state issues, concentrating their efforts on accomplishing major tasks. The Communist Party and the democratic parties supervise each other, promoting the improvement of Communist Party leadership and the strengthening of the construction of participating parties. This not only avoids the political turmoil caused by multi-party competition and confrontation, but also avoids the various drawbacks caused by one-party dictatorship and lack of supervision. The great advantage of our party system lies here, and this is also the fundamental difference from the one-party system and multi-party system in foreign countries." This speech made a profound summary of the political advantages of this basic political system and enriched the theory of Marxist China-style democratic political construction.
3. Developing grassroots autonomy and expanding grassroots democracy
There was a significant change in the overall thinking of political system reform before and after the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Before the 14th National Congress, the main approach was to promote it from top to bottom. After the 14th National Congress, based on the principle of addressing easy issues before difficult ones, the focus shifted to promoting the construction of grassroots democratic political systems through a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches, positioning it as one of the socialist democratic systems that must be adhered to and improved.
The main contents of the construction of grassroots democratic politics include: strengthening the autonomy of rural villagers, establishing and improving villagers' committees; promoting and improving the system of residents' autonomy in urban communities; fully leveraging the role of enterprise workers' congresses, institutionalizing workers' participation in democratic management. Regarding the autonomy of rural villagers, after the legal status of villagers' committees as grassroots mass self-governing organizations in rural areas was established in the Constitution passed in 1982, the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress passed the "Organic Law of the Villagers' Committees of the People's Republic of China (Trial)" in November 1987, which clearly defined the nature, functions, and related issues of villagers' committees. In November 1994, the Communist Party of China issued a notice, requiring various localities to conscientiously implement this law when strengthening the construction of grassroots Party organizations in rural areas,establishing and improving villagers' committees and village groups, improving the system of villagers' autonomy, and better utilizing the self-management, self-education, and self-service capabilities of grassroots mass self-governing organizations. Regarding the construction of the system of residents' autonomy in urban communities, after the system of residents' committees was written into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1982, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress enacted the "Organic Law of Urban Residents' Committees" in 1989, which provided legal guarantees for the development of urban residents' committees. Regarding workers' congresses, as the basic system for implementing democratic management and coordinating labor relations in enterprises, it increasingly emphasizes its irreplaceable role in promoting democratic management, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers, and advancing the stable development of enterprises.
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party fully affirmed and recognized the practice of expanding grassroots democracy and ensuring the direct exercise of democratic rights by the people, considering it as the most extensive practice of socialist democracy. It further demanded the improvement of democratic election systems and the implementation of transparency in governmental affairs and finance at the grassroots level. It emphasized the importance of allowing the masses to participate in discussions and decision-making regarding grassroots public affairs and public welfare, as well as implementing democratic supervision over cadres. The democratic management system in enterprises and institutions, with workers' congresses as its basic form, should also be continued, improved, and utilized to involve workers in reforms and management, and protect their legitimate rights and interests. The Congress also emphasized the need to rectify behaviors that suppress democracy or enforce orders. In accordance with these requirements, in April 1998, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Office of the State Council issued the "Notice on the Universal Implementation of Village Affairs Transparency and Democratic Management Systems in Rural Areas," which put forward more specific requirements for improving democratic elections, decision-making, management, and supervision. In the same year, in June, the State Council presented the "Revised Draft of the Organic Law of the Village Committee of the People's Republic of China," which was reviewed and passed by the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress in November of the same year. Subsequently, the work of electing members of village committees through democratic elections began in rural areas across the country, and the system of village self-governance gradually improved. By the end of 2004, there were 644,000 village committees established nationwide. The majority of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities had completed the turnover elections of the fifth and sixth committees.
In terms of urban grassroots democratic development, in 1999, the Ministry of Civil Affairs carried out community development pilot projects in 26 urban areas nationwide, strengthening the construction of residents' committees and implementing democratic elections, decision-making, management, and supervision. By the end of 2004, 71,375 residents' committees had been established nationwide. As of September 2004, 595,000 workers' congresses had been established in enterprises and institutions, covering 78.36 million workers, accounting for 58.5%.
With the deepening of economic system reform, the central government has emphasized the active role of workers' congresses in democratic management and supervision in state-owned enterprises. In October 1998, Jiang Zemin stated, "Implementing democratic management by workers and the masses in state-owned enterprises, just like implementing village self-governance in rural areas, is an important creation of our construction of socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics. In carrying out various work in enterprises, democratic management by workers and the masses can only be strengthened and must not be weakened. The more significant the issues related to enterprise reform, development, and the vital interests of the masses, the more we must genuinely listen to the opinions of the workers through workers' congresses and other forms, truly achieve collective consultation and concerted efforts, and jointly promote the operation, management, and efficiency of enterprises." Workers' congresses in many enterprises have played a positive role in grassroots political development and enterprise reform and development.
II. Implementing the basic strategy of governing the country in accordance with the law
The development of socialist democracy must be closely integrated with the improvement of socialist legal system. This is an important task and inevitable requirement for the development of socialist democratic politics. One important aspect of advancing political system reform is to continuously strengthen the construction of socialist legal systems. The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party made new explorations in strengthening the construction of socialist legal systems when it discussed political system reform, gradually institutionalizing and legalizing socialist democratic politics in China. Guided by this ideology, the construction of legal systems and other systems in China has steadily progressed. In April 1990, the Central Committee issued the "Circular on Maintaining Social Stability and Strengthening Political and Legal Work," which stated, "Strengthening socialist democracy and legal systems is an important aspect of improving the socialist system and an important guarantee for maintaining social stability." To strengthen the leadership of political and legal work, political and legal committees were reestablished from the central to local levels.
In 1992, while establishing the goal of reforming the socialist market economy system, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward new requirements for improving socialist legal system. Jiang Zemin pointed out, "Strengthening legislation, especially formulating and improving laws and regulations that safeguard reform and opening up, strengthen macroeconomic management, and regulate microeconomic behavior, is an urgent requirement for establishing the socialist market economy system." After the 14th National Congress, through the reform practice of establishing the socialist market economy system, the CPC Central Committee repeatedly emphasized that the establishment and improvement of the socialist market economy system must be regulated and guaranteed by comprehensive legal frameworks. Economic management must be carried out using legal means, and there must be a unity between reform and opening up and the construction of the legal system. Therefore, the "Decision on Several Issues concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy System" (1993) specifically outlined the goals of legal construction, including following the principles specified in the Constitution, accelerating economic legislation, further improving civil and commercial laws, criminal laws, and laws related to state institutions and administrative management. By the end of the 20th century, a legal system adapted to the socialist market economy should be established. It also called for reforms to improve the judicial system and administrative law enforcement mechanism, enhance the standards of judiciary and administrative law enforcement, establish sound law enforcement supervision mechanisms and legal service institutions, carry out in-depth legal education, and enhance the legal consciousness and rule of law awareness of the entire society. These goals reflect the need for the development of the socialist market economy and embody the requirement of governing the country according to the law.
Starting from December 1994, the CPC Central Committee began irregularly organizing legal lectures at the Huiren Hall in Zhongnanhai. The members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Central Secretariat, and the State Council's leaders took the lead in attending and studying legal knowledge, creating an atmosphere in the Party and the whole society to willingly learn the law, apply the law, and enhance legal awareness. In February 1996, during the third legal lecture organized by the central authorities, Jiang Zemin proposed the idea of "governing the country according to the law." In his summary speech, he said that strengthening the construction of the socialist legal system and governing the country according to the law is an important component of Deng Xiaoping Theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as a crucial guideline for our Party and government to manage state and social affairs. Realizing and adhering to the rule of law means gradually making all work of the country more standardized and institutionalized, allowing broad masses of people to participate in the country's management, economic and cultural affairs, and social affairs according to the provisions of the Constitution and laws through various channels and forms under the leadership of the Party. This also means gradually achieving institutionalization and institutionalization of socialist democracy. Realizing and adhering to the rule of law has significant importance for promoting sustained, rapid and healthy economic development, comprehensive social progress, and ensuring long-term stability of the country. In March of the same year, during the 4th session of the 8th National People's Congress, "governing the country according to the law" was established as the goal and direction of the political system reform and was written into the "Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Outline of the Long-Range Goals for the Year 2010" approved at the session.
In 1997, when making strategic arrangements for the development across the century, the 15th National Congress of the CPC elevated "governing the country according to the law" to a more prominent position as a governance strategy. The report of the 15th National Congress of the CPC stated: The democratic development must be closely combined with the improvement of the legal system to implement governance according to the law. Governing the country according to the law and building a socialist legal system are the fundamental strategies for the Party to lead the people in governing the country, the objective needs of developing the socialist market economy, important signs of social progress, and important guarantees for long-term stability of the country. In March 1999, the 2nd session of the 9th National People's Congress passed a constitutional amendment that fixed "governing the country according to the law and building a socialist legal system" in the form of a fundamental law of the state.
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China has made great achievements in socialist legal construction. In terms of legislation, in addition to amending the Constitution and four amendments to the Constitution, by the end of 2002, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee had formulated 297 laws and passed decisions on 125 legal issues. The State Council formulated 933 administrative regulations. China's socialist legal system has taken shape preliminarily. After the 15th National Congress of the CPC, guided by the basic strategy of "governing the country according to the law and building a socialist legal system," efforts have been made to further strengthen legislation and promote judicial system reform, striving to achieve the goal of forming a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics by 2010.
III. Enrichment and Development of the Socialist Spiritual Civilization Construction Ideology in Practice
While promoting reform and opening up and focusing on economic development, the ideology of building socialist spiritual civilization has gradually been enriched. The Resolution on the Guiding Principles for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization, adopted in September 1986, played an important role in the practice of spiritual civilization construction. In early 1992, Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour Speech elevated the construction of spiritual civilization to a new height, emphasizing the need to both grasp economic development and strengthen the construction of the two civilizations, surpassing capitalism. The 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made it clear that "both material civilization and spiritual civilization must be well developed in order to have socialism with Chinese characteristics," and it included the construction of socialist spiritual civilization as one of the driving forces for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, emphasizing the importance of spiritual civilization construction. These statements not only further clarified the important position of spiritual civilization construction in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also further clarified the basic principles for constructing spiritual civilization. The principle of "emphasizing the construction of spiritual civilization" is a scientific conclusion drawn from summarizing past lessons. It requires the use of methods such as discussion, reasoning, education, and guidance to solve issues of ideological nature. Only by persisting in "emphasizing construction" in this way can the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people be fully mobilized to construct socialism with Chinese characteristics that is vibrant and full of vitality. This is a significant step forward in guiding the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.
Under the promotion of the Southern Tour Speech and the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Party has explored new theories and practices in strengthening ideological and moral construction, as well as the development of education, science, and culture, and has made new progress.
In terms of strengthening ideological and moral construction, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the need to vigorously carry out education on the Party's basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialist ideology among the people of all ethnic groups, especially young people, in order to establish correct ideals, beliefs, and values. After the congress, various forms of education activities on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism were widely carried out throughout society. On August 23, 1994, the Communist Party of China Central Committee promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of Patriotic Education," which provided clear principles, main contents, and work priorities for patriotic education, and required relevant departments at all levels to regard patriotism as the fundamental project for strengthening the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. On August 30, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the "Opinions on Further Strengthening and Improving Moral Education in Schools," which required the education front to take a historical perspective and recognize the importance of moral education in the new era with a strategic vision. In accordance with the central requirements, party committees at all levels made plans and deployments for carrying out patriotic education universally, and made efforts to improve the construction of patriotic education bases and create a social atmosphere for patriotic education.
In terms of propaganda and ideological work, Jiang Zemin, in his speech at the National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work in January 1994, proposed that propaganda and ideological work must arm people with scientific theories, guide public opinion correctly, shape people with noble spirits, and inspire people with excellent works, continuously cultivating and fostering generations of socialistic new individuals with ideals, morals, culture, and discipline, and playing a strong role in providing ideological and public opinion support for the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is not only the guiding principle for cultural publicity in the new era, but also has an important guiding role in improving the effectiveness of various measures for spiritual civilization construction.
In terms of developing the education sector, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further emphasized the need to prioritize education and strive to improve the ideological, moral, and scientific literacy of the whole nation, which is the fundamental plan for realizing the modernization of our country. In light of this, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China solemnly announced that by the end of the 20th century, the eradication of illiteracy among young and middle-aged adults and the basic realization of a nine-year compulsory education system would be achieved. The China Youth Development Foundation launched the "Hope Project" in October 1989, which aims to rescue out-of-school youth and support education in impoverished areas through social fundraising. After the implementation of this project, it immediately received widespread support from all sectors of society. In May 1990, the first "Hope Elementary School" was established in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province. The launch of the "Hope Project" is like building a bridge for impoverished children to access education, effectively promoting the development of education.
In terms of cultural development, it emphasizes the promotion of the main theme of the times. In 1991, advocated by the CPC Central Committee, the Propaganda Department organized the implementation of the "Five Ones Project" aimed at promoting the main theme of the times and excellent traditional culture in the spiritual civilization construction. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and central state organs participate in the evaluation. Each year, one good book, one good play, one excellent film, one excellent TV series, and one good theoretical article are produced (later adding one good song, one good radio drama, one good TV theoretical special, etc.). After the implementation of this project, outstanding works that promote the main theme of the times and enthusiastically extol the reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction continue to emerge, making efforts to address major theoretical and practical issues in reality.
With the gradual implementation of various measures for spiritual civilization construction, the relationship between spiritual civilization construction and economic and social development has become increasingly close. In September 1995, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in March 1996, the resolution on the "Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the 2010 Vision" and the report on the resolution incorporated spiritual civilization construction into the planning of economic and social development.
In order to strengthen the Party's guidance on spiritual civilization construction under the conditions of the socialist market economy system, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in October 1996 passed the "Resolution on Several Important Issues in Strengthening the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization" (referred to as the "Resolution"). This is the second resolution issued by the Party Central Committee within ten years for the purpose of strengthening the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. This resolution focuses on the grand goal of China's development across the century, further clarifies the guiding ideology, overall requirements, and main goals for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization in the future 15 years. The "Resolution" points out that the guiding ideology and overall requirements for spiritual civilization construction are: guided by Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the Party's basic line and basic principles, strengthen the construction of ideology and morality, develop education, science and culture, arm people with scientific theories, guide public opinions correctly, shape people with noble spirits, inspire people with outstanding works, cultivate socialist citizens with ideals, morals, culture, and discipline, improve the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation, unite and mobilize all ethnic peoples to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country.
Regarding the main goals of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization from 1996 to 2010, the "Resolution" stipulates: firmly establish the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics among the whole nation, firmly establish the unwavering belief in adhering to the Party's basic line; achieve significant improvement in the quality of citizens, with ideological and moral cultivation, scientific education level, and democratic legal concept as the main contents; achieve significant improvement in the quality of cultural life, with active, healthy, colorful, and service-oriented demands as the main requirements; achieve significant improvement in the degree of urban and rural civilization, with social atmosphere, public order, and living environment as the main indicators; and form a good situation of coordinated development between material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction nationwide.
"The Resolution" provides a preliminary summary of the experience of carrying out spiritual civilization construction in the new situation of socialist market economy. It fully affirms that the development of socialist market economy is conducive to enhancing people's self-awareness, competition awareness, efficiency awareness, democratic and legal awareness, and pioneering and innovative spirit. At the same time, it clearly points out that the weaknesses and negative aspects of the market will also be reflected in spiritual life. Strengthening spiritual civilization construction requires guiding people to handle the relationships between competition and cooperation, autonomy and supervision, efficiency and fairness, early prosperity and late prosperity, economic efficiency and social benefits. It advocates giving priority to the interests of the state and the people while fully respecting the legitimate interests of individual citizens, strictly preventing the introduction of the principle of commodity exchange in economic activities into the political life of the Party and the administrative work of state organs. These experiences reflect the Party's new thinking on the issue of spiritual civilization construction under market economy conditions. The "Resolution" adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee marks a new level of the Party's understanding of spiritual civilization construction.
After the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, various regions and departments, in order to implement the spirit of the plenary session, have included increasing investment in spiritual civilization construction and carrying out mass spiritual civilization creation activities as important contents in formulating development plans and long-term goals. In order to ensure the implementation of the "Resolution" organizationally, in May 1997, the CPC Central Committee decided to establish the Central Committee for the Guiding of Spiritual Civilization Construction as the decision-making body for guiding the construction of national spiritual civilization. Subsequently, corresponding institutions were established in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to strengthen spiritual civilization construction. Mass activities with the main content of creating civilized cities, civilized towns and villages, and civilized industries have thrived all over the country, presenting a vivid scene of all parties jointly building and the masses actively participating, creating a favorable atmosphere for reform, opening up, and economic construction.
IV. Developing advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics
Developing advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is an inevitable requirement for comprehensively promoting the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is also the goal of socialist spiritual civilization construction. The leading collective of the Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core made concerted efforts to explore a correct path for the development of advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.
In his speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1989, Jiang Zemin pointed out: "In essence, the construction of spiritual civilization is to improve the quality of the whole nation and cultivate 'new people' with the 'four virtues'. It is inconceivable that a nation without a strong spiritual pillar can stand on its own among the nations of the world." He emphasized the need to actively absorb all excellent achievements from our country's historical culture and foreign cultures, and "oppose national nihilism and worship of foreign things that negate traditional Chinese culture". In his speech commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China in 1991, Jiang Zemin elaborated on the guiding ideology, basic elements, and development direction of socialist cultural construction. He pointed out that we must "resist and eliminate all backward and decadent ideological and cultural influences, and constantly create a new, advanced, and healthy socialist culture." "Only by deeply rooted in the Chinese soil and relying on the power of the people, facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future, can we create a socialist culture worthy of the great era." Here, the seed of developing advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics has sprouted.
In 1997, the report of the 15th CPC National Congress provided an exposition of the program for building socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, adding the requirement of developing "a scientific, popular, and socialist culture that is rooted in the nation, inherits the fine cultural traditions of history, and absorbs beneficial achievements from foreign cultures." The new summary of "building a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics" by the 15th CPC National Congress highlights its "cultural" nature and is connected to the connotation of socialist spiritual civilization in the basic sense. Jiang Zemin pointed out: "As for the main content of the culture with Chinese characteristics, it is consistent with the socialist spiritual civilization we have consistently advocated since the reform and opening up. Culture is relative to the economy and politics." Spiritual civilization is relative to material civilization. Only with the coordinated development of economy, politics, and culture, and only when both civilizations are well established, can it be considered as socialism with Chinese characteristics." Here, it clearly explains the different corresponding relationships between "civilization" and "culture". It is based on this understanding that, in order to gradually improve their respective corresponding relationships, starting from the 15th National Party Congress, this new expression of changing perspective has become a symbol of the transformation of the theory of socialist spiritual civilization construction towards the development of advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.
After Jiang Zemin's speech on the "Three Represents" in February 2000, the idea of developing advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics became increasingly prominent. In the important ideology of the "Three Represents," the concept of "advanced culture" not only attracted special attention but also closely linked the development of advanced culture with the party's construction. Jiang Zemin said, "Because our party represents the forward direction of advanced culture, all party comrades must always adhere to the guidance of Marxism, strive to inherit and develop all the fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation, learn and absorb all the excellent cultural achievements from foreign countries, thereby continuously creating and promoting socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, achieving the coordinated development of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization, and promoting comprehensive progress in society." In his speech on July 1, 2001, Jiang Zemin reviewed the forward direction of the Chinese Communist Party representing advanced culture from a historical perspective, and expounded on the theory and practice principles of the Chinese Communist Party continuing to represent the forward direction of China's advanced culture from a current perspective. He pointed out, "Our party must always represent the forward direction of China's advanced culture, that is, the party's theory, line, program, policy, and all work must strive to embody the requirements of developing a modern, world-oriented, future-oriented, national, scientific, and popular socialist culture, promote the continuous improvement of the ideological, moral, and scientific cultural qualities of the entire nation, and provide spiritual and intellectual support for our country's economic development and social progress." He also said, "In contemporary China, developing advanced culture means developing the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the construction of socialist spiritual civilization." Therefore, the relationship between the three concepts of "advanced culture," "culture with Chinese characteristics," and "socialist spiritual civilization" becomes clear at a glance, and their connotations are equivalent. The speech on July 1st also discussed comprehensively grasping the dialectical relationship between the construction of the two civilizations, firmly grasping the development trend and requirements of China's advanced culture, the fundamental task of developing socialist culture, and the relationship between the development of socialist culture and the inheritance and promotion of all excellent cultures, as well as fully reflecting the spirit of the times and the spirit of creativity. Thus, the basic framework for developing the advanced culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics was constructed. The report of the 16th National Party Congress in 2002 further elaborated on the chapters of "economic construction and economic system reform," "political construction and political system reform," and "cultural construction and cultural system reform." In the chapter on "cultural construction and cultural system reform," a comprehensive discussion was conducted on the content of socialist advanced culture with Chinese characteristics, and the overall requirements for developing socialist advanced culture with Chinese characteristics in the new century were put forward.
Based on Jiang Zemin's above explication, developing advanced culture with Chinese characteristics in socialism with Chinese characteristics generally includes the following basic principles.
First, adhere to the guidance of Marxism. Jiang Zemin pointed out, "What kind of cultural direction to adhere to and promote, is a banner for a political party in terms of ideology and spirit." Adhering to the guiding position of Marxism, in terms of guiding ideology, diversity is never allowed, and it is the fundamental principle of building Chinese socialist culture.
Second, adhere to the fundamental task of cultivating "Four-Have" citizens as the construction of socialist advanced culture with Chinese characteristics. "The fundamental task of developing socialist culture is to cultivate generation after generation of citizens who have ideals, morals, culture, and discipline. "This is a comprehensive requirement for the overall quality of all citizens. Whether it is about the construction of socialist spiritual civilization or the development of advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, this task must be undertaken. It is the fundamental driving force for the progress and development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The third is to adhere to the direction of "two orientations" and the policy of "the Two Centenaries". Serving the people and serving socialism are the fundamental purposes of developing socialist culture. "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is the basic policy for building socialist culture. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin emphasized many times that the policy of "the Two Centenaries" must not be changed or abandoned and must be firmly adhered to forever. The policy of "the Two Centenaries" reflects the characteristics and laws of the development of cultural undertakings and is the fundamental policy for promoting the prosperity and development of advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.
The fourth is to adhere to the development orientation of "facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future". The "three orientations" guarantee that the construction of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics has distinct characteristics of the times. To achieve the "three orientations", it is necessary to simultaneously adhere to the policy of "using the past for the present and using foreign things for China". "We must extract the essence from the national traditional culture, discard the dross, combine it with the characteristics of the times, make innovations, and continuously promote its development. We must also actively absorb all the outstanding cultural achievements created by humanity and integrate them into the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. Only by deeply rooted in the Chinese land and relying on the strength of the people, facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future, can we create a socialist culture that is worthy of the great times."
The fifth is to adhere to the characteristics and characteristics of the "national, scientific, and popular culture" of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. Its "nationality" lies in its deep origins in the five thousand years of civilization history of the Chinese nation and its roots in the practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics; it not only has national forms that the people enjoy, but also reflects the rich content of the people's modern way of life, mode of thinking, moral sentiments, aesthetic tastes, and fashion habits. Its "scientificity" lies in its advocacy of science, opposition to superstition, and resolute struggle against all feudal ignorance and pseudo-science. Its "popularity" lies in its origin from the people, its service to the people, its education of the people, and its enjoyment by the people.
In summary, the construction of advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is to vigorously develop advanced culture, support healthy and beneficial culture, strive to transform backward culture, resolutely resist decadent culture, constantly enrich people's spiritual world, constantly strengthen people's spiritual power, and strive to form theoretical guidance, public opinion force, spiritual pillar, and cultural conditions that reflect the requirements of China's advanced productive forces, reflect the direction of China's advanced culture, and reflect the fundamental interests of the broadest people of China.
While the theoretical understanding of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics continues to become more enriched and improved, the Party Central Committee also emphasizes several important aspects of the specific implementation of developing advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, and increases the efforts to improve and reform."
Firstly, promoting ideological and moral construction promotes the healthy development of social and cultural undertakings and the socialist market economy. Ideological and political work is an important political advantage of the Communist Party of China. Jiang Zemin pointed out that the more we develop the economy and the more we reform and open up, the more we need to attach importance to ideological and political work. "Strengthening socialist ideological and moral construction is an important content and central link in the development of advanced culture." In September 2001, based on summarizing years of practical experience, the Party Central Committee issued the "Outline for the Implementation of Citizen Moral Construction." The "Outline for the Implementation of Citizen Moral Construction" proposes that it is necessary to firmly establish the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the correct world view, life view, and values ​​of the whole nation; vigorously promote the basic moral norms of "loving the country and abiding by the law, polite and honest, unity and friendship, diligence and self-improvement, professionalism and dedication" in the whole society; establish a socialist ideological and moral system that is compatible with the socialist market economy, coordinated with socialist legal norms, and inherited from the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation.
Secondly, promoting and cultivating the great national spirit. National spirit is the spiritual support for the survival and development of a nation. A nation cannot stand among the nations of the world without an inspiring spirit and noble character. Jiang Zemin pointed out that in the more than 5,000 years of development, the Chinese nation has formed a great national spirit with patriotism as the core, unity and unity, love for peace, diligence and bravery, and the spirit of self-improvement. This national spirit is broad and profound, long-lasting, and an indispensable component of the Chinese nation's life organism. This national spirit, combined with the fine traditions and spirit of the times formed by our party in the long-term revolution, construction, and reform, is a powerful spiritual driving force for the continuous development and growth of the Chinese nation.
Thirdly, promoting the development of cultural undertakings fundamentally through education and science. Education is the foundation for the development of science and technology and the cultivation of talents. It plays a leading and overall role in modernization construction and must be given strategic priority in development. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We must do everything possible to solve the education problem, even sacrificing some speed and tolerating in other areas." Jiang Zemin once emphasized that in the entire process of socialist modernization construction, the strategic position of prioritizing the development of education must be adhered to and cannot be shaken. If we do not recognize the education problem in this way now, we will miss the opportunity and delay important matters, and we will make historical mistakes. In view of the fact that philosophy and social sciences have not received the attention they deserve in society, Jiang Zemin pointed out that philosophy and social sciences are important tools for people to understand and transform the world and important forces to promote historical development and social progress. "In the process of understanding and transforming the world, philosophy and social sciences are equally important as natural sciences; it is equally important to cultivate high-level philosophers and social science researchers as it is to cultivate high-level natural scientists; it is equally important to improve the philosophical and social science literacy of the entire nation as it is to improve the natural science literacy of the entire nation; it is equally important to appoint and make good use of philosophers and social science talents as it is to appoint and make good use of natural science talents." It is necessary to correct the bias of some regions and departments that do not value philosophy and social sciences.
Fourthly, vigorously promote cultural system reform. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee has vigorously promoted the reform of the cultural management system in accordance with the characteristics and laws of socialist spiritual civilization construction, and to adapt to the requirements of the development of socialist market economy. The National Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work held in January 1994 further clarified the guidelines of promoting the main theme and advocating diversified cultural construction. Localities and departments adhere to the guidance, overall planning, structural adjustment, and efficiency improvement in cultural construction, actively cultivate the socialist cultural market and promote its healthy development. Based on this, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held in 1996 made detailed plans for the development of socialist cultural undertakings in the new century. The meeting pointed out that the primary task of prospering literature and art is to produce excellent works with ideological and artistic unity, strong attractiveness, and infectiousness under the correct guidance; news and propaganda must adhere to the Party's principles, seek truth from facts, focus on promoting solidarity and stability, carry out positive propaganda, and firmly grasp the correct direction of public opinion; philosophy and social sciences must adhere to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, and adhere to the integration of theory with practice, provide services for the Party and government decision-making, and serve the construction of the two civilizations; the cultural market should both prosper and be regulated, vigorously support healthy cultural products, advocate beneficial cultural and entertainment activities suitable for the consumption level of the masses, and promote the healthy development of the cultural market. In order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to continue to deepen the reform of the cultural management system, and quickly form a development pattern in which the state guarantees the development of key cultural undertakings and encourages social organizations to establish cultural undertakings.
Under the above ideological guidance, the reform of the cultural management system and operational mechanism has gradually deepened. In terms of ownership, the practice of the state monopolizing cultural undertakings for a long time has been changed, allowing the development of various forms of cultural industries. In terms of administrative management, a cultural management system with classification guidance and hierarchical management has been established, and the personnel system and distribution system within cultural institutions have been reformed. This change has turned attention from supporting individuals to supporting the development of cultural undertakings, fully stimulating the vitality of cultural institutions.
Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 15th National Congress of the Party, the construction of cultural undertakings has taken "quality strategy" as its core. Under the promotion of strengthened management and deepened reforms, a new situation of prosperity and development has emerged. In addition to continuing to organize and implement the "Five Projects" of spiritual civilization construction, various departments and regions have also strengthened the management of spiritual products production and cultural markets. The state has successively formulated and improved relevant policies and regulations such as the "Regulations on Publishing Management," "Regulations on Printing Industry Management," "Regulations on Audio and Video Product Management," "Regulations on Commercial Performances Management," and "Regulations on Radio and Television Management," providing necessary legal and policy support for the entry of cultural quality products into the market, ensuring that healthy cultural products firmly occupy the dominant position in the cultural market. By the end of 2000, the national radio coverage rate and television coverage rate reached 92.1% and 93.4% respectively, increasing by 13.4% and 8.9% compared with 1995. Excellent works reflecting the spirit of the times and close to people's lives have emerged continuously. Through the exhibitions, screenings, broadcasts, and displays of award-winning works of the "Five Projects," the exemplary role of excellent works has been fully played. The socialist cultural position has been consolidated, and a healthy and positive public opinion environment, a civilized and harmonious social atmosphere, and rich and diverse cultural life have been formed.
After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a relatively complete and systematic theory of building an advanced socialist culture with Chinese characteristics was established. It is a new development of the Party's ideology in cultural construction under new historical conditions and a new achievement in exploring the path of Marxist Chinese-style development.
Chapter 9: Strategy for the Development of Reform and Opening-Up in the New Century and the Development of the Cause of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
Since the 1990s, when the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core was promoting the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, it comprehensively arranged and deployed how China could cross the century in terms of development strategy, diplomacy, national defense, and the reunification of the motherland. These issues fully reflect the theoretical development and practical innovation of Marxism in China, combining the international and national situations faced by the third generation of central leadership collective.
I. Formulation of the development strategy for reform, opening-up, and modernization
After the early realization of the "first step" and "second step" strategic goals of social development in China in the 1990s, the third generation of the Party's central leadership collective, with Jiang Zemin as the core, formulated a new plan for the realization of the "third step" strategic goals and successively put forward a series of strategic deployments such as "rejuvenating the country through science and education," "sustainable development," and "combining introduction and going out," further enriching and developing the strategic development of China's modernization with Chinese characteristics.
1. Rejuvenating the country through science and education and sustainable development strategies
The strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education and sustainable development is a major strategic decision made by the central leadership based on Deng Xiaoping's theory and the Party's basic line, starting from the national conditions of China, and scientifically analyzing the trends of world economic and social development in order to achieve the grand goal of the "three steps."
From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Deng Xiaoping stressed on multiple occasions the importance of "achieving the Four Modernizations, with science and technology as the key and education as the foundation" and "paying attention to education and science and technology in the long run" and stated that "science and technology are the primary productive forces."
In the 1990s, based on the inheritance of Deng Xiaoping's theory, the central leadership collective with Jiang Zemin as the core further clarified the strategic thinking of rejuvenating the country through science and education and included it as a basic national policy. At the 14th National Congress of the Party in 1992, Jiang Zemin pointed out, "We must shift economic development to rely on scientific and technological progress and improve the quality of the workforce." The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Accelerating Scientific and Technological Progress, promulgated on May 6, 1995, first proposed the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education nationwide. Jiang Zemin stated, "Rejuvenating the country through science and education means fully implementing the idea that science and technology are the primary productive forces, adhering to education as the foundation, giving science and technology an important position in economic and social development, enhancing the country's scientific and technological strength and its ability to transform productivity, and improving the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation." In the same year, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee made implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education one of the important guidelines for accelerating socialist modernization in China in the next 15 years and until the 21st century, in its recommendations on the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" for national economic and social development and the 2010 long-term goals. In 1996, the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress formally approved the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" for national economic and social development and the 2010 long-term goals, making "rejuvenating the country through science and education" a basic national policy.
Rejuvenating the country through science and education is not only aimed at promoting rapid economic development but also at promoting the coordinated development of the economy and society. Achieving rapid development and coordination requires considering the sustainability of development, adapting the scale and speed of development to the basic national conditions and conforming to the objective laws of economic and social development. Therefore, after the rapid development of China's economy in the 1980s, the Party Central Committee began to pay more attention to the issue of sustainable development in China, drawing lessons from the development of industrialized countries in the world while summarizing China's historical experience and continuously understanding the laws of economic development, and proposed the strategy of sustainable development.
In October 1993, based on Deng Xiaoping's ideas on coordinating population, environment, and resource development and China's actual situation, the Party Central Committee and the State Council proposed the concept of implementing the strategy of sustainable development in China. In 1994, the Chinese government formulated and approved the "China Agenda 21 - China's 21st Century White Paper on Population, Environment, and Development," establishing the overall strategic framework and main goals for China's sustainable development in the 21st century. In March 1996, the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" for national economic and social development and the 2010 long-term goals, approved by the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, made sustainable development an important guiding principle and strategic goal, and clearly made a major decision for China to implement the strategy of sustainable development in its future economic and social development. The 15th National Congress of the Party reiterated this strategic decision and emphasized that China, as a country with a large population but relatively insufficient resources, must implement a sustainable development strategy in its modernization process.
The sustainable development strategy represents a significant breakthrough from traditional development perspectives. It provides a new angle and fully elucidates the major issues concerning China's future development, including how to build socialism in a country with a backward economic and cultural foundation and extremely imbalanced levels of productive forces, as well as how to promote economic growth and comprehensive social development. It sets the correct direction for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
2. The Western Development Strategy
The implementation of the Western Development Strategy and the acceleration of development in the central and western regions were significant decisions made by the Party Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin as the core, in line with Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking on China's modernization process in the late 1990s. It was a visionary and comprehensive decision for the future, looking ahead to the 21st century.
In 1988, after the comprehensive launch of reform and modernization, Deng Xiaoping proposed the strategy of "two major undertakings" in China's modernization process. He said, "We need to accelerate the opening-up of the coastal regions, so that this vast region, with a population of 200 million, can rapidly develop and drive the development of the inland areas. This is a matter concerning the overall situation. The inland regions must consider the overall situation as well. Conversely, when development reaches a certain stage, it will require the coastal regions to provide more support for the development of the inland areas. This is also a major issue. At that time, the coastal regions must also abide by this overall situation." He also envisioned that when the entire nation reaches a moderately prosperous level by the end of the 20th century, more efforts should be made to help accelerate development in the central and western regions. After 1995, as China's second-step development goals for modernization were achieved ahead of schedule, the Party Central Committee began to consider Deng Xiaoping's second major undertakings more prominently. When formulating the "9th Five-Year Plan" and the 2010 Perspective Target Outline, narrowing the regional development gap and promoting coordinated regional economic development were regarded as important guidelines. The 15th National Congress of the Party in 1997 also explicitly stated the need to promote a rational regional economic layout and coordinated development, gradually narrowing economic development gaps between regions. Based on the general principles of "overall planning, adapting to local conditions, leveraging strengths, division of labor and cooperation, and coordinated development," the Party Central Committee made comprehensive arrangements for the healthy development of China's regional economy. On June 17, 1999, Jiang Zemin presided over a symposium on reform and development in the five northwestern provinces in Xi'an, where he proposed the timely implementation of the Western Development Strategy to accelerate development in the central and western regions. He pointed out that accelerating the development of the western regions is a strategic decision that has significant economic, political, and social implications. The conditions for accelerating the development of the central and western regions are basically in place, and the timing is ripe. From now on, this should be regarded as a major strategic task for the Party and the country, given greater prominence.
After a series of preparations, in October 2000, the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Party Congress passed the "Suggestions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development," formally proposing the Western Development Strategy. It stated that the implementation of the Western Development Strategy and the acceleration of development in the central and western regions are crucial measures for economic development, ethnic unity, social stability, regional coordination, and ultimately achieving common prosperity, which are essential steps towards accomplishing the strategic goals of the third stage of development. Subsequently, the Western Development Strategy was swiftly implemented, and remarkable achievements were made.
3. The combination strategy of "bringing in" and "going out"
Based on the new trend of global economic globalization and the development process of China's reform and opening up, the Party Central Committee timely proposed and implemented the strategy of combining "bringing in" and "going out" in the new era, promoting the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive, multi-level and broad-based development of opening up.
In February 1998, Jiang Zemin proposed at the Second Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee the guidelines for responding to the Asian financial crisis: while actively expanding exports, we should systematically organize and support a group of state-owned enterprises with strength and advantages to invest and establish factories overseas, both "bringing in" and "going out". The two aspects of opening up are interrelated and interdependent. In October 2000, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee officially proposed: with a more proactive attitude, seize opportunities, meet challenges, seek benefits and avoid harm, promote comprehensive, multi-level and broad-based opening up, develop an open economy, implement the "going out" strategy, and strive for new breakthroughs in utilizing domestic and foreign resources and markets.
In March 2001, the Fourth Session of the 9th National People's Congress passed the Outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China, which further deployed the implementation of the "going out" strategy of opening up. According to this deployment, China's opening up has shifted from focusing on "bringing in" in the past to a combination of "bringing in" and "going out", actively participating in international cooperation, expanding the scope of opening up, adopting a more proactive approach, and achieving significant results in a short period of time. By the end of 2001, China had participated in 195 overseas resource cooperation projects, with a total investment of 4.6 billion US dollars; established 6,610 overseas enterprises with a total agreed investment of 12.3 billion US dollars, of which Chinese investment amounted to 8.4 billion US dollars; signed total contracts for foreign contracted projects amounted to 99.7 billion US dollars, with a turnover of 71.5 billion US dollars, driving exports of nearly 6 billion US dollars; signed foreign labor service contracts amounted to 26.8 billion US dollars, with a turnover of 20.7 billion US dollars, and dispatched 2.52 million person-times of labor services. Various forms of foreign economic cooperation have continued to grow steadily. In 2001, 15 large-scale engineering projects involving electricity, transportation, construction, petrochemicals and other industries were newly signed, with an average foreign investment of 2.52 million US dollars, an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year. Large backbone enterprises such as China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation, Haier Group, etc., have played a leading role in implementing overseas investment strategies and have begun to take shape as multinational corporations.
The combination strategy of "bringing in" and "going out" has effectively promoted the development of an open economy and made the comprehensive, multi-level and broad-based pattern of opening up clearer. The Chinese economy has further integrated into the process of economic globalization and has gained a broader development space. This is another far-sighted decision made by the Party Central Committee on the development path across the century.
The introduction and implementation of the above development strategies reflect the objective process and laws of China's modernization construction, which not only have Chinese characteristics but also embody the glorious tradition of communists in China's combining Marxist basic principles with China's actual conditions.
II. Deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises
State-owned enterprises are the backbone of China's national economy and have made tremendous contributions to the country's construction and development. However, due to the long-term operation under the planned economic system, there have been significant shortcomings such as excessive control by the state, rigid operating mechanisms, and neglect of the role of the market. Therefore, the task of reform is also the most arduous.
1. Achieve the three-year goal of getting out of the crisis and establishing a modern enterprise system.
After the establishment of the goal of reforming the socialist market economy system, starting from 1994, the reform of state-owned enterprises entered the stage of transforming operating mechanisms and establishing modern corporate systems. With the transformation of the system and the dramatic changes in the market environment, many contradictions and problems accumulated by state-owned enterprises under the planned system were exposed, mainly manifested as inactive mechanisms, and a considerable number of enterprises did not adapt to the requirements of the market economy. Therefore, they fell into unprecedented difficulties in fierce market competition. In the first quarter of 1996, after the profits and losses of 68,800 independently accounted state-owned industrial enterprises were offset, the first net loss since the founding of New China occurred.
In response to this situation, the central government believed that the only way for state-owned enterprises to overcome difficulties was to adapt to the needs of developing the socialist market economy, continue to accelerate and deepen reforms, and establish modern corporate systems. In order to achieve this, the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further clarified the direction of state-owned enterprise reform and proposed the goal of striving to initially establish modern corporate systems in the majority of large and medium-sized state-owned backbone enterprises by the end of the 20th century, with significant improvements in operational conditions, and to open up a new situation in the reform and development of state-owned enterprises, thus pushing forward the state-owned enterprise reform to a crucial stage.
The difficulties in the operation of state-owned enterprises are not only due to inactive mechanisms but also due to the unreasonable layout and structure of the state-owned economy. The frontline is too long and too dispersed, and the scale of enterprises is small with low quality. This is an important reason for high input and low output, high consumption, and low efficiency. If this layout and structure are not changed, it is difficult to promote the reform of individual enterprises. Therefore, the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China also proposed that, strategically adjusting the layout of the state-owned economy, the state-owned economy must dominate in important industries and key areas that are related to the lifeline of the national economy. In other areas, the overall quality of state-owned assets can be improved through asset reorganization and structural adjustment. The reform of state-owned enterprises should be combined with reorganization, transformation, and strengthening of management, focusing on the overall state-owned economy, strengthening large enterprises, activating small ones, and implementing strategic reorganization of state-owned enterprises.
The First Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee made it clear that within about three years, through reform, reorganization, transformation, and strengthening of management, most large and medium-sized state-owned loss-making enterprises should be freed from difficulties, and by the end of the 20th century, efforts should be made to initially establish modern corporate systems in the majority of large and medium-sized state-owned backbone enterprises.
After the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a comprehensive reform focusing on establishing modern corporate systems was launched. The pilot program for establishing a modern corporate system, which started in 1994, expanded significantly in 1997. The number of pilot cities for "optimizing the capital structure" increased from 18 to 111, and the number of pilot enterprise groups increased from 56 to 120. Through these pilot programs, in accordance with the requirements of developing a socialist market economy, a strategic reorganization of the entire state-owned enterprise was implemented and a new management system was established.
A number of large enterprise groups were successively formed, including China National Petroleum Corporation, Sinopec Group, Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation, 10 defense industry groups, 3 non-ferrous metal groups, 4 information industry groups, and so on. These large enterprise groups operate according to market requirements, no longer assuming administrative functions, and are authorized by the government to operate state-owned assets, thereby enhancing their ability to develop independently and participate in international competition.
The cities involved in the pilot program for "optimizing the capital structure" have begun to form a competition mechanism of survival of the fittest through encouraging mergers, regulating bankruptcy, downsizing and transferring employees, and reducing personnel to improve efficiency. For state-owned small enterprises, various forms such as reorganization, collaboration, merger, leasing, contracting, cooperative stock, and sale are adopted to loosen and revitalize, and some key aspects of the sale of small enterprises are regulated. 
The basic characteristic of the modern enterprise system is the corporate system, and the typical forms of the corporate system are joint-stock limited companies and limited liability companies. The prominent feature is that small amount of capital combines in a shareholding manner to form a corporate capital, in order to adapt to the needs of socialized large-scale production and pursue greater capital appreciation. This is a typical form of enterprise organization in modern economic society. The reform of the shareholding system in China gradually began in the mid and late 1980s, and a large number of shareholding pilot enterprises have appeared in various parts of the country in the early 1990s.
On December 19, 1990, and July 3, 1991, with the approval of the State Council, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange were successively established. After 1992, inspired by Deng Xiaoping's speech in the south, the shareholding system reform entered a new stage of development. In March of the same year, relevant departments of the State Council jointly formulated 11 regulations including the "Pilot Measures for Shareholding Enterprises", further standardizing and promoting the shareholding system reform.
After 1998, in accordance with the requirements of establishing a modern enterprise system, a large number of state-owned enterprises carried out corporate and shareholding reforms. Many large-scale enterprises and enterprise groups, after asset restructuring according to international practice, have successfully listed on domestic or overseas capital markets. This not only raised a large amount of social capital and improved asset structure and operational conditions but also played an important role in establishing a modern enterprise system, promoting the formation of a diversified investment and financing system, expanding the channels for national fiscal revenue, and improving the efficiency of economic operation.
By the end of 2000, there were 1,088 listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, with 1,257 listed securities. The number of investors in the stock market reached 58.01 million, and the total market value of stocks reached 4.8091 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the GDP. In just a decade, China's shareholding economy has gone through a path that took Western developed countries more than 100 years to complete, and it has occupied a significant position in the national economic life, with an increasingly prominent role in promoting economic development and reform.
To reverse the loss situation of state-owned enterprises, the textile industry, which suffers from the most severe losses, was chosen as a breakthrough. Starting with "reducing the number of spindles, reducing staff, and improving efficiency," the textile industry underwent asset restructuring, adjusted production structure, and transformed management mechanisms in accordance with market requirements. In 1998, a total of 5.12 million backward cotton spindles were eliminated, 660,000 laid-off workers were resettled, and losses were reduced by 2.6 billion yuan, taking an important step towards achieving the goal of turning the entire industry from loss to profit within three years. The coal industry also reversed the loss situation by measures such as "decentralization, closing mines, and reducing production capacity," reducing excess production capacity and eliminating backward enterprises.
To ensure that state-owned enterprises achieve the overall goal of reform and revitalization within three years, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council also decided to establish a system of special inspectors dispatched by the State Council. Special inspectors of state-owned enterprises are held by vice-ministerial-level or higher cadres. The state plans to gradually dispatch inspectors to 1,000 large-scale enterprises and enterprise groups, and in 1998, inspectors were first sent to 500 enterprises. Their main task is to conduct financial audits, examine the profit and loss and asset-liability situations of enterprises, and evaluate the financial conditions and work performance of the main leaders of the enterprises, and then make reports to the State Council after being reviewed by relevant departments. Local governments dispatch members of the supervisory board to state-owned enterprises or wholly state-owned companies and state-owned holding companies under their jurisdiction for oversight.
On April 28, 1998, the first batch of 21 inspection envoys and over 80 inspection envoy assistants began their training. In order to ensure that the envoys fulfill their responsibilities effectively, the State Council formulated and promulgated the "Regulations on Inspection Envoys". Inspection envoys represent the state in exercising supervisory powers, strengthening the government's supervision over enterprises while implementing the separation of administration and enterprise, and allowing state-owned enterprises to operate independently. Through financial supervision and examination of operational results, they evaluate the implementation of the Party's policies, state laws and regulations, as well as the performance of the main leaders of the enterprise. Based on inspection conclusions, the State Council makes rewards, punishments, and appointments of the main leaders of the enterprise through the personnel department. The implementation of this system has played a significant role in the construction of leadership teams in state-owned enterprises and the implementation of various reform measures.
2. Implementation of the reemployment project for laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises
Ensuring the basic livelihood and reemployment of laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises is an important aspect of the success of the reform of state-owned enterprises. "The way to govern lies in reassuring the people, and reassuring the people lies in understanding their suffering." The Party Central Committee has paid high attention to the temporary difficulties encountered by some laid-off workers. Jiang Zemin emphasized on multiple occasions that the vast number of employees in state-owned enterprises have made significant contributions to the country's economic construction, reform and opening up, and the development and growth of state-owned enterprises over the past decades. Party committees and governments at all levels must always care for them and effectively safeguard their interests.
From May 14th to 17th, 1998, the Party Central Committee and the State Council held a conference on the livelihood guarantee and reemployment of laid-off workers in Beijing, and formulated measures for the transfer of surplus personnel and the implementation of the reemployment project. Jiang Zemin pointed out at the conference: This work is not only a major economic issue but also a major political issue; it is not only an urgent practical issue but also a long-term strategic issue. Party committees and governments at all levels must prioritize and handle it well as a top priority. The conference proposed that the basic living expenses of laid-off workers must be guaranteed. The funds should be jointly provided by the government, enterprises, and society, and the basic living expenses should be timely and accurately distributed to each laid-off worker, without delay, misappropriation, or deduction. Otherwise, responsibilities should be pursued. The most important thing is to help laid-off workers find reemployment. This work is related to the success or failure of SOE reform, the interests of workers, and is an indispensable stage in the reform process, it is a major issue and an important task for the overall situation.
In June, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued a notice on doing a good job in the basic livelihood and reemployment of laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises, stating that in the future, to ensure the realization of the goals of state-owned enterprise reform proposed at the 15th Party Congress, to complete the strategic adjustment of state-owned economy, it is necessary to make solving the basic livelihood and reemployment issues of laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises a top priority, and strive to achieve the number of people reemployed each year to be greater than the number of newly laid-off workers in that year, with more than 50% of the already laid-off and newly laid-off workers in 1998 getting reemployed. Efforts should be made to establish, in about five years, a social security system and employment mechanism that adapt to the requirements of a socialist market economy.
Central leaders have frequently visited grassroots communities to conduct investigations and research on the employment and livelihood issues of laid-off workers, and to extend condolences to those facing difficulties. In accordance with the central government's arrangements, local governments have successively established "three guarantees" for laid-off workers: first, a basic living allowance for laid-off workers; second, those who remain unemployed after three years can transition to receiving unemployment insurance benefits; third, those who remain unemployed after two years of receiving unemployment insurance can be eligible for the minimum living guarantee for urban residents as stipulated by regulations. At the same time, governments at all levels have strengthened vocational training in various forms, expanded employment channels, established re-employment service centers, guided workers in changing their job-seeking mindset, and vigorously promoted the re-employment of laid-off workers. From 1998 to 2000, a total of 21 million laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises nationwide entered re-employment service centers, of which 13 million successfully re-employed, providing strong support for the smooth progress of state-owned enterprise reforms.
3. Strengthening party leadership over large state-owned enterprises
To strengthen leadership over large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approved the establishment of the Central Committee for Work in Large Enterprises on July 9, 1998. Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, served as the secretary. Its responsibilities are as follows: responsible for managing the party leadership positions within large state-owned enterprises supervised by the State Council and state-owned enterprises under state control, in order to promote the implementation of the Party's line, principles and policies, as well as relevant spirits of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, in large state-owned enterprises; based on the requirements of the socialist market economic system and the establishment of a modern enterprise system, research and explore reforms and strengthen the construction of leadership teams in large state-owned enterprises; complete other work assigned by the Central Committee. The State Council also stipulated that government agencies are strictly prohibited from providing guarantee for enterprise economic activities. The implementation of these supporting measures has accelerated the pace of state-owned enterprise reforms.
During this period, the Party Central Committee strengthened its research work on state-owned enterprises, and central leaders went to the frontlines multiple times to provide specific guidance on reforms. From April to August 1999, Jiang Zemin visited Chengdu, Wuhan, Xi'an, Qingdao, Dalian, and other places for inspections, and presided over a series of symposiums to express important opinions on the reform and development of state-owned enterprises. He pointed out that the comprehensive promotion of the reform and development of state-owned enterprises is an inevitable and crucial task. To win this tough battle not only determines the success of state-owned enterprise reforms but also relates to the overall success of the economic system reform. We must seize opportunities, make resolute decisions, exert great efforts, effectively solve the deep-rooted contradictions and problems faced by state-owned enterprises, and further enhance their vitality. The state should concentrate its efforts on developing a group of large enterprises and enterprise groups in key industries and areas that are vital to the national economy, making them the main force of the national economy. Various forms should be adopted for small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, allowing them to operate more flexibly and encouraging their accelerated development. The establishment of a modern enterprise system is the fundamental system for the development of enterprises under the conditions of a socialist market economy. Without the establishment of effective mechanisms for management and market operations in enterprises, the socialist market economic system cannot ultimately be established, and the combination of public ownership and a market economy cannot be realized. In the reform of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to pay attention to strengthening party leadership. These important speeches have further provided guidance for the breakthroughs in state-owned enterprise reforms.
In September 1999, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China further discussed issues related to the reform and development of state-owned enterprises and passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development of State-Owned Enterprises" (referred to as the "Decision"), which set goals for the reform and development of state-owned enterprises until 2010. "The Decision" points out that the reform of state-owned enterprises is a broad and profound transformation. To enhance the country's economic strength, national defense capabilities, and national cohesion, it is necessary to continuously promote the development and growth of state-owned economy, and overall enhance the vitality of state-owned enterprises and the controlling power of state-owned economy. This is of great significance for establishing a socialist market economy system, promoting sustained, rapid and healthy economic development, improving people's living standards, maintaining a stable and united political situation, and consolidating the socialist system. To advance the reform and development of state-owned enterprises, the first priority is to make every effort to achieve the goals set forth in the 15th Party Congress and the 1st Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee. By 2010, in order to adapt to the fundamental changes in the economic system and the economic growth model and meet the requirements of expanding opening up, it is necessary to basically complete the strategic adjustment and restructuring of state-owned enterprises, form a relatively rational layout and structure of state-owned economy, establish a relatively sound modern enterprise system, significantly improve economic efficiency, and significantly enhance the ability of technological development, market competition, and risk resistance. This will enable state-owned economy to better play a leading role in the national economy. "The Decision" also puts forward a series of major policy measures, mainly including: strategically adjusting the layout of state-owned economy, combining it with the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure and ownership adjustment, adhering to both advancement and retreat, and doing what should be done and avoiding what should not be done based on different circumstances; continuing to carry out strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises; giving priority to the separation of government and enterprises, exploring effective forms of state-owned assets management, carrying out standardized corporate system reform, and transforming the operating mechanism, and establishing and improving the modern enterprise system; gradually solving issues such as high debt ratio, insufficient capital, and heavy social burdens of state-owned enterprises; effectively reducing number of employees, increasing efficiency, promoting reemployment, and social security work; accelerating technological progress and industrial upgrading; strengthening the Party's leadership over the reform and development of state-owned enterprises, and so on. 
The above goals and policy measures make the overall thinking of the reform of state-owned enterprises clearer and the guidelines more explicit. They are not only guiding significance for achieving the three-year goals of reform and revitalization, but also for the development of state-owned enterprises in the new century.
Under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee, state-owned enterprises continue to make great strides in deepening reforms from multiple perspectives. From 1998 to 2000, more than 2,700 pilot enterprises were established to implement modern enterprise system, as determined by the central government and selected by local governments. Most of them have carried out corporate or shareholding system reforms. Among the 520 state-owned and state-controlled enterprises listed as national key enterprises, 430 have undergone corporate system reform, accounting for 83.7%. Profits in state-owned and state-controlled industries have increased substantially. By the end of 2000, the number of large and medium-sized state-owned and state-controlled enterprises that suffered losses in 1997 had been reduced by more than 70%; profits of state-owned and state-controlled industrial enterprises reached 239.2 billion yuan, a 1.97-fold increase over 1997’s 80.6 billion yuan; state-owned small enterprises also achieved profits of 4.81 billion yuan, ending six consecutive years of net losses. Many state-owned enterprises that have long been in difficulties have begun to emerge from the bottom, with significantly improved operating conditions, creating a new situation for the reform and development of state-owned enterprises, and basically achieving the three-year goals of reform and revitalization proposed at the 15th Party Congress. This is the result of the Party Central Committee's timely grasp of the opportunity and correct decision-making at the critical stage of reform and development, as well as the significant contributions made by the Chinese working class and the Party to the country's economic construction and reform cause.
III. Adhering to the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and advancing the great cause of national reunification
Adhering to the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and advancing the reunification of the motherland, this great cause has already been initiated in the 1980s and has achieved good results. In the 1990s, this cause continued to make significant progress.
1. The proposal of the eight-point statement on the development of cross-strait relations
After the proposal of the "One Country, Two Systems" policy by the Communist Party of China and the historical changes that have taken place in the mainland of the motherland, the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan were forced to adjust their policies towards the mainland. In 1987, Chiang Ching-kuo announced the lifting of martial law in Taiwan from July 15th and subsequently opened up for compatriots from Taiwan to visit the mainland. Since then, the long-standing separation between compatriots on both sides of the strait has finally been broken. A large number of Taiwanese compatriots have come to the mainland to visit relatives, travel, and do business, and the economic and trade relations across the Taiwan Straits have rapidly expanded. 
The Communist Party of China (CPC) attaches great importance to the new changes in the cross-strait relations and actively promotes further development of the cross-strait relations. In December 1990, the CPC held a national conference on Taiwan affairs, proposing that the top priority of Taiwan work is to strengthen cross-strait contacts, further expand personnel and various exchanges, especially strengthen economic and trade exchanges, and achieve two-way and direct "Three Links". On March 5, 1994, the 6th session of the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's Congress passed the "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots in the People's Republic of China", which put the protection of Taiwanese investment on the track of legal institutionalization and further promoted the development of cross-strait economic relations. In April 1994, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council held a special conference on Taiwan's economic work, which comprehensively summarized the successful experience in the development of economic relations across the Taiwan Straits and proposed the principle of "equal priority, appropriate relaxation" in the areas and projects of Taiwan's investment. It required all regions and departments to attach great importance to Taiwan's economic work, take practical measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese businessmen in the mainland, and improve the investment environment for Taiwanese businessmen in the mainland.
In order to promote substantive progress in cross-strait relations and establish channels of communication between the two sides of the strait, on December 16, 1991, the mainland side set up the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. This is a non-governmental organization whose purpose is to promote cross-strait exchanges, develop cross-strait relations, and achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. In March 1992, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits initiated substantive negotiations with the Taiwan Strait Exchange Foundation. In order to clarify the adherence to the principle of one China, after the first round of working negotiations in March 1992, Tang Shubei, the executive deputy director of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, further expounded the attitude of adhering to the principle of one China in the working negotiations on cross-strait affairs. In response, the Taiwan side had to express its adherence to the principle of one China and recognize the fact that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. After multiple consultations, the two sides reached the "1992 Consensus", each expressing in oral form the adherence to the principle of one China.
On August 4, 1992, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, wrote to Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Strait Exchange Foundation, expressing his hope to hold talks on issues such as the economic development of the two sides of the strait and the affairs of the two organizations. On the 22nd, the Strait Exchange Foundation replied accepting the invitation. After several preparatory consultations, from April 27 to 28, 1993, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, and Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Strait Exchange Foundation, held the first talks in Singapore. Although this meeting was only of a civil, economic, functional, and transactional nature, its content was extensive and its significance was significant, attracting attention at home and abroad. The two sides reached agreements such as the "Wang-Koo Talks Joint Agreement" and the "Agreement on Contact and Talks between the Two Organizations". Subsequently, in order to implement the various agreements reached in the "Wang-Koo Talks", from August 1993 to January 1995, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Strait Exchange Foundation held six working negotiations at the level of deputy secretary-general in Beijing, Taipei, and Nanjing. Tang Shubei, the executive deputy director of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, also went to Taiwan to hold talks with Jiao Renhe, deputy director and secretary-general of the Strait Exchange Foundation, and reached specific consensus on three topics: resolving disputes over fishing in the sea between the two sides, negotiating the repatriation of hijackers and the repatriation of personnel who violate relevant regulations to the other side's territory. Both sides believed that strengthening multi-level communication between the two organizations will help further enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstandings, narrow differences, and foster mutual trust.
To provide a clearer explanation of the Chinese government's policy on the Taiwan issue to both domestic and international audiences, on January 30, 1995, Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, delivered an important speech entitled "Continuing to Struggle for the Completion of the Great Cause of National Reunification" in which he put forward eight propositions for the current development of cross-strait relations and the promotion of peaceful reunification of the motherland: (1) Adhere to the one-China principle, which is the basis and prerequisite for achieving peaceful reunification; (2) Cross-strait peaceful reunification negotiations can be conducted step by step; (3) Efforts should be made to achieve peaceful reunification, but the use of force is not ruled out; (4) Strongly develop economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the strait in the face of the 21st century; (5) Both sides of the strait should jointly inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of Chinese culture; (6) Further place hope in the compatriots in Taiwan; (7) Welcome parties and individuals from Taiwan to exchange opinions with us on cross-strait relations and peaceful reunification; (8) The leaders of both sides visit each other in appropriate capacities.
These eight propositions put forward by Jiang Zemin further advanced the nine guidelines proposed by Ye Jianying in 1981, making Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" more specific in terms of prerequisites, principles, methods, and steps. These eight propositions not only embody the consistency and continuity of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government's policy towards Taiwan, but also demonstrate their firm determination and sincere intention to develop cross-strait relations and achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. They are a landmark document for resolving the Taiwan issue in the new era, with strong practical and profound historical significance. 
2. Successfully resolving the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland
Just as cross-strait relations were developing smoothly, the return of Hong Kong and Macao entered the "countdown" phase. The continuous development of relations between Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and the mainland can be attributed, to a large extent, to the policy of "one country, two systems". While the concept of "one country, two systems" was initially proposed to resolve the Taiwan issue, it was first successfully applied to the resolution of the Hong Kong and Macao issues.
The issue of Hong Kong is a historical legacy of British colonial aggression against China. The Hong Kong region consists of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times. After the Opium War in 1840, the British forced the Qing government to sign three unequal treaties: the Treaty of Nanjing, the Treaty of Beijing, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, which resulted in the occupation of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, and subjected Hong Kong to British colonial rule. The successive governments of China before the 1911 Revolution did not recognize the aforementioned unequal treaties and conducted multiple negotiations with Britain to recover Hong Kong. In the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to special internal and external circumstances, the CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong decided to "temporarily leave Hong Kong alone". After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government adopted a policy of "long-term planning and making full use of" regarding Hong Kong. It did not recognize the three unequal treaties imposed on China by imperialism but, considering historical factors, temporarily maintained the status quo and sought to peacefully resolve the issue through negotiations at an appropriate time.
In the new era of reform and opening up, as the deadline for the "lease" of Hong Kong approached, the Communist Party of China began to consider the policy of "one country, two systems" to reclaim sovereignty over Hong Kong. Starting from October 1982, after three stages and 22 rounds of arduous negotiations, the leaders of China and the United Kingdom finally signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong on December 19, 1984. The declaration announced that the Chinese government had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and the British government would hand over Hong Kong to China on the same day. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Joint Declaration, the handover ceremony of the Hong Kong political regime between China and the UK took place in Hong Kong from midnight on June 30 to the early hours of July 1, 1997. The smooth return of Hong Kong is the result of the successful implementation of the "one country, two systems" concept. It symbolizes the rectification of the century-long national humiliation suffered by the Chinese people in Hong Kong and marks the entry of Hong Kong's development into a new era.
When the process of Hong Kong's return started, the issue of Macau's return was also put on the agenda.
In 1974, the Portuguese government announced the abandonment of all overseas colonies and recognized Macau as Chinese territory, not a colony. In February 1979, China and Portugal established diplomatic relations and reached an understanding on the issue of Macau. The Portuguese government recognized that Macau is Chinese territory, and both sides agreed to resolve this issue through negotiations between the two governments at an appropriate time. In June 1986, the Chinese and Portuguese governments began negotiations on the issue of Macau. On April 13, 1987, the Prime Ministers of the two countries officially signed the Joint Declaration between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the Question of Macau in Beijing. It declared that the Macau Special Administrative Region is Chinese territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macau on December 20, 1999. In the early hours of December 20, 1999, under the attendance of the highest leaders of the country, government representatives from China and Portugal held a grand ceremony for the transfer of sovereignty in Macau. President Jiang Zemin solemnly announced that the Chinese government would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macau. 
The smooth return of Hong Kong and Macau opened a new era of common development between the two regions and the mainland. By resolving the issues of Hong Kong and Macau through diplomatic negotiations and the principle of "one country, two systems," the Communist Party of China made a significant contribution to the world's peaceful development and progress. The successful practice of "one country, two systems" after the return of Hong Kong and Macau has proven that it is not only the most realistic approach to achieve national reunification but also the most important institutional guarantee for the stability, prosperity, and development of the returned regions.
3. Promote the early resolution of the Taiwan issue in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems"
In the late 1980s, there were major changes in the political situation in Taiwan. With the lifting of martial law and the localization of political power, the "Taiwan independence" forces became increasingly active. From early 1988 to 2000, Lee Teng-hui used power tactics to consolidate his position and gradually abandoned the principle of "one China," promoting the policy of creating "two Chinas." Since 1993, the Taiwan authorities have intensified their efforts to seek "participation in the United Nations" and engage in so-called "holiday diplomacy" and "dollar diplomacy," intentionally creating the concept of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the international community. Especially in June 1995, with the permission of the United States, Lee Teng-hui visited the United States and delivered a political speech at Cornell University, repeatedly emphasizing the "Republic of China in Taiwan" and intensifying activities to create "two Chinas" internationally. At the same time, Taiwan has conducted consecutive "military exercises" targeting the mainland, creating a tense atmosphere between the two sides.
The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always maintained a high degree of vigilance against the escalating separatist activities of the Taiwan authorities and have firmly fought against separatism and "Taiwan independence" in politics, military, diplomacy, and public opinion. The Chinese people's struggle against separatism and "Taiwan independence" has effectively countered the separatist forces advocating "Taiwan independence" on the island and made the international community further recognize the harm of "Taiwan independence," and the majority of Taiwanese people have come to understand that "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end path. The US government has also made a commitment to continue to adhere to the "one China" policy and stated that it does not support Taiwan independence. Under various pressures, the leader of Taiwan had to express that it is currently unnecessary and not necessary to immediately declare "Taiwan independence".
Due to Li Denghui's visit to the United States, the second "Wang-Koo meeting" could not proceed as planned, and negotiations at all levels were forced to be completely suspended. In order to ease and improve cross-strait relations, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist Party of China, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits have respectively expressed their willingness to resume negotiations on the basis of the One China principle. In September 1997, Jiang Zemin once again solemnly called on the Taiwan authorities to engage in political negotiations with us as soon as possible in his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. After numerous consultations, from October 14 to 19, 1998, Koo Chen-fu led a delegation from the Taiwan Strait Exchange Foundation to visit the mainland. Jiang Zemin met with Koo Chen-fu and his wife, and Wang Daohan had two meetings with Koo Chen-fu, reaching a four-point consensus, thereby ushering in the beginning of political dialogue between the two sides and improving the atmosphere of cross-strait relations.
However, just when knowledgeable people in the mainland and Taiwan were actively promoting the development of cross-strait relations, the Taiwan authorities chose to continue on the path of destruction and confrontation. On July 9, 1999, Li Denghui openly proposed the "two-state theory" and claimed that the cross-strait relations were "the relations between countries, at least the relations between special countries". In March 2000, in the elections held in Taiwan, the Kuomintang was defeated and Democratic Progressive Party leader Chen Shui-bian was elected as the new leader of Taiwan. Although at the beginning of his term, he repeatedly advocated "sincerity" and "goodwill" in reopening dialogue and improving cross-strait relations, he adopted an evasive, vague, and refusal attitude towards the key issue of accepting the One China principle. Subsequently, he not only denied the existence of the "1992 Consensus", deliberately obstructed the resumption of cross-strait negotiations, but also used various means to gradually implement the "Taiwan independence" agenda. On August 3, 2002, Chen Shui-bian gave a televised speech to the 29th World Conference of Taiwanese Compatriots held in Tokyo, Japan, openly declaring "Taiwan and mainland China as two separate countries" and advocating the use of a "referendum" to decide "Taiwan's future, destiny, and present situation", revealing the nature of his obstinate adherence to the "Taiwan independence" stance.
Whether it is the "two-state theory" or the "two separate countries theory", these remarks disregard the well-being of the people of Taiwan and lead Taiwan towards disaster. As soon as these remarks were made, they were immediately met with strong opposition from all Chinese people, including Taiwanese compatriots. People from all walks of life in various regions of the country as well as overseas Chinese strongly condemned the words and actions of the Taiwan authorities in dividing the motherland.
Although the Taiwan authorities are engaged in "Taiwan independence" activities, which restrict and hinder further development of cross-strait relations, various exchanges and cooperation between the two sides are unstoppable. With the increasing interactions between people from both sides, Taiwanese compatriots have gained a better understanding of the situation in mainland China, and more and more people realize that the development and future of Taiwan are inseparable from the mainland. Economic and trade exchanges are the most active and dynamic factors in cross-strait relations. As of October 2002, Taiwanese investors have made more than 55,000 investments in the mainland, with contracted Taiwanese capital exceeding $60 billion. The total trade volume between the two sides has reached over $260 billion. In this case, Taiwanese people urgently demand the realization of direct "Three Links". With the mainland of our country and Taiwan joining the World Trade Organization, closer economic relations have been established between the mainland of our country and Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Undoubtedly, this trend will further increase the common interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the economy, promote the common development and prosperity of the economies of the two sides, and become an important force for maintaining and promoting cross-strait relations and achieving national reunification.
The process of promoting the great cause of national reunification by the Communist Party of China clearly shows that "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" is the basic policy for national reunification. It is the creative development of Marxist strategic thinking by the Communist Party of China on how to achieve national reunification. The efforts of the Communist Party of China to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland represents the common interests and wishes of all Chinese people and compatriots at home and abroad. Adhering to this basic policy and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date is an unshakable belief of all Chinese sons and daughters and an irresistible trend of historical development.
IV. Establishing a comprehensive foreign relations framework for the new century
Adhering to and developing the independent and peaceful diplomatic thinking is the new contribution of the Communist Party of China in the 20th century Marxist diplomatic thinking. This thinking further enhances the ability of the Communist Party of China to deal with international affairs in its external interactions. The construction of a comprehensive and multilevel diplomatic relations framework, the rapid development of various partnership relationships, and frequent summit diplomacy are all manifestations of the enhanced ability of the Communist Party of China to respond to international affairs. These all reflect the promotion and development of Marxist diplomatic thinking by Chinese communists in a "new" sense.
From a practical perspective, since the mid-1990s, China's diplomatic work has mainly faced three tasks: firstly, it needs to respond to various changes in international relations brought about by the trend of multipolarity and establish a comprehensive and multilevel framework for foreign relations in the 21st century; secondly, it needs to oppose various hegemonism and power politics, maintain world peace, and promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable international political and economic new order to safeguard the rights and interests of all countries in the world, especially the majority of developing countries; and thirdly, it needs to respond to the impact of the trend of economic globalization and rapid development of high technology on our country.
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, China has fully implemented its established basic diplomatic policies and enriched and developed its ideological connotations according to changes in the international situation and new practices. The independent and autonomous nature of China's diplomacy has become more distinct. Its prominent manifestations are as follows: First, starting from national interests and always placing the sovereignty and security of the country in the first place, and never allowing any country to interfere in China's internal affairs. Second, insisting on determining the areas and pace of opening up independently based on national conditions. It is not only insisting on expanding opening up and fully utilizing various favorable conditions and opportunities brought about by economic globalization, but also maintaining a clear understanding of possible risks, strengthening prevention, and effectively safeguarding national economic security. Third, adhering to true non-alignment. China not only does not form alliances with any country, but also does not take the lead in the world socialist movement or developing countries. Fourth, respecting world diversity, handling international affairs in a spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and promoting the democratization of international relations.
China's diplomacy also exhibits some new characteristics in terms of form: First, summit diplomacy has played an unprecedented and irreplaceable role. Chinese leaders frequently appear at important international occasions, expanding China's international influence and demonstrating the increased international status of China. The second is that China has established regular meetings, consultations, and dialogue mechanisms of different levels in its partnerships and cooperation with other countries and regional organizations. This new mechanized mode of operation not only enhances the effectiveness of bilateral and multilateral cooperation but also contributes to the stability and further development of relations among all parties. The third is that the Communist Party of China focuses on practical results and extensively exchanges and cooperates with ruling parties and legitimate opposition parties in countries around the world, ensuring that the relationship between parties serves the country's development strategy and overall diplomacy, and providing an important guarantee for the long-term stability and healthy development of bilateral relations.
At the turn of the century, China basically established a comprehensive and multi-layered diplomatic relationship pattern. Since the reform and opening-up, China's diplomacy has been developing in this direction. In the second half of the 1990s, this work made significant progress. When building a new foreign relationship pattern for the 21st century, China takes into account its relations with major powers and developed countries, as well as its relations with neighboring countries and developing countries. It attaches importance to the development of bilateral relations with various countries, actively engages in multilateral diplomacy, attaches importance to relations with governments of various countries, pays attention to the development of the Communist Party of China's relations with political parties around the world, and also emphasizes the conduct of various forms of people-to-people diplomacy.
Stabilizing and developing relations with major powers and developed countries is of great significance to China's socialist modernization construction and to maintaining world peace and development. In the mid-1990s, Chinese leaders proposed to actively develop a new type of major power relationship characterized by non-alignment, non-confrontation, and not targeting third parties. Based on this principle, China has established and developed the basic framework of bilateral relations with Russia, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the European Union facing the 21st century.
China and the United States, one being the largest developing country and the other being the largest developed country in the world, have always had some contradictions and differences, some of which have been difficult to eliminate for quite some time. However, they also have common interests in major issues concerning world peace and development. It is precisely because of this that although the China-US relationship has experienced ups and downs, the overall trend is to continue moving forward. Chinese leaders have always viewed China-US relations from a strategic perspective and a long-term perspective, insisting on taking the three joint communiqués between China and the United States as the foundation for developing bilateral relations. They advocate dealing with the differences between the two countries in the spirit of mutual respect, equality, consultation, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, actively seeking convergence of common interests. In October 1997, President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to the United States and the two sides announced that they would jointly work towards establishing a constructive strategic partnership for the 21st century. Maintaining and developing a healthy and stable China-US relationship not only serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also benefits the peace, stability, and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the entire world.
China and Russia are each other's largest neighbors. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, China and Russia established diplomatic relations and smoothly transitioned from Sino-Soviet relations to Sino-Russian relations. Since then, the relationship between the two countries has entered a new stage of mutual respect and friendly neighboring. In the second half of the 1990s, China-Russia relations made more explicit progress. In April 1996, President Yeltsin visited China on a state visit. China and Russia signed a Joint Declaration, announcing the determination to develop a strategic partnership based on equality and trust for the 21st century. In April 1997, Chairman Jiang Zemin visited Russia on a state visit, and the two countries signed a Joint Declaration on world multipolarity and the establishment of a new international order, expressing their willingness to work together to establish a new international political and economic order that is peaceful, stable, just and equitable. In July 2001, Chairman Jiang Zemin visited Russia on a state visit again, and the heads of state of both countries officially signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation between China and Russia, which marked an important milestone in the bilateral relationship. China and Russia have become good neighbors who get along with each other friendly, and there are vast prospects for exchange and cooperation in various fields between the two sides.
Since the basic resumption of normal relations with Western Europe in 1991, China's relations with Western Europe have entered a stage of steady development. Frequent visits between Chinese and European leaders have effectively promoted the development of bilateral relations. During his visit to France in September 1994, Chairman Jiang Zemin put forward four principles for China's relations with Western Europe, expressing the willingness to develop a long-term and stable friendly cooperation relationship towards the 21st century. In 1997 and 1998, China established comprehensive partnership with France and the United Kingdom respectively. As an important regional organization, the European Union has taken a series of measures conducive to the development of China-EU relations. In 1998, the first meeting between Chinese and EU leaders was held in London, and the two sides issued a joint statement, emphasizing the willingness of China and the EU to establish a long-term, stable and constructive partnership for the 21st century. Subsequently, the EU decided to elevate its relations with China to a level as important as those with the United States, Japan, and Russia. Through joint efforts, China and European countries have shown good prospects for cooperation in various fields.
China and Japan are neighboring countries separated only by a strip of water. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1972 and the signing of the peace and friendship treaty in 1978, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a period of comprehensive development, and progress has been made in various fields of bilateral relations. In 1998, Chairman Jiang Zemin visited Japan on a state visit, and the two sides issued the "China-Japan Joint Declaration," announcing that China and Japan would establish a "friendly cooperative relationship oriented towards peace and development." At the same time, the Japanese side for the first time acknowledged its aggression against China, expressed deep reflection and apology, and jointly confirmed with the Chinese side that a correct understanding and handling of history is an important foundation for the development of Sino-Japanese relations. Overall, the development of China-Japan relations has been smooth, and friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields have made continuous progress, bringing significant benefits to both countries and making positive contributions to peace, stability, and development in the local region and the world.
Actively developing friendly relations with neighboring countries, maintaining peace and stability, and promoting common development, are important goals of China's diplomacy. In the early 1990s, China normalized relations with all neighboring countries. Since then, China's relations with neighboring countries have continued to develop. China established diplomatic relations and established the "Shanghai Five" mechanism with Central Asian countries, as well as the "Shanghai Cooperation Organization" consisting of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan; participated in the Six-Party Talks involving China, North Korea, South Korea, the United States, Japan, and Russia, aimed at establishing a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, and made positive contributions to maintaining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.
China's relationship with ASEAN has attracted attention. In 1996, China became a comprehensive dialogue partner of ASEAN. At the end of 1997, the two sides issued the "Joint Statement of the China-ASEAN Summit", which established the goal of building a neighborly partnership of mutual trust for the 21st century and provided guiding principles for bilateral relations. On issues with disputes such as the South China Sea, China clearly stated that it is willing to properly resolve relevant disputes through peaceful negotiations with the countries concerned based on universally recognized international law and other principles and legal systems. After the Asian financial crisis, China provided assistance to the relevant countries through bilateral and multilateral channels and fulfilled its commitment to keep the RMB stable, receiving widespread acclaim internationally. In the 21st century, China and ASEAN countries have continuously expanded mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, playing an important role in promoting regional peace and stability.
Consolidating and developing friendly cooperation relations with countries in South Asia is an important part of China's stable periphery. In November 1996, Chairman Jiang Zemin made a state visit to India. During the visit, Chairman Jiang Zemin put forward five proposals for China and South Asian countries to jointly build a long-term and stable neighborly relationship for the future. The two countries decided to establish a constructive partnership for future cooperation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. Subsequently, China and Pakistan also announced the establishment of a comprehensive partnership for the 21st century. In early 2002, the new government of Afghanistan was established, and the Chinese government immediately recognized and supported it. The improvement and development of China's relations with South Asian countries plays a significant role in maintaining peace and stability in the region.
Actively engaging in multilateral diplomacy is a prominent feature of China's diplomacy at the turn of the century. After China resumed its legitimate seat at the United Nations in 1971, it began to gradually participate in activities in various fields of multilateral diplomacy centered around the United Nations. In the mid-1980s, China clearly identified multilateral diplomacy as a major content of its independent, peaceful foreign policy. In the 1990s, China became increasingly active in the field of multilateral diplomacy and achieved remarkable results.
Opposing hegemonism and power politics and safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries are important principles that China follows in its multilateral diplomatic activities. After the end of the Cold War, faced with the practices of Western countries interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries under various pretexts in the field of multilateral diplomacy, China has always adhered to principles such as respecting national sovereignty and independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. China has closely cooperated and supported developing countries, effectively resisting and fighting against various hegemonic acts in international relations. Since 1990, with the support of third world countries, China has successfully defeated proposals against China made by Western countries in the United Nations Human Rights Council for ten consecutive times. China has shown its support and active participation in various organizations, such as the United Nations, aimed at promoting North-South dialogue and strengthening South-South cooperation. China has established effective cooperative relationships with the Group of 77 countries and has participated as an observer in the Non-Aligned Movement.
The establishment of a new international political and economic order is a major issue in contemporary international relations. As early as the late 1980s, Deng Xiaoping proposed the establishment of a new international political and economic order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This issue became even more prominent after the end of the Cold War. The Chinese government believes that the new international political and economic order should guarantee the rights of countries to sovereignty, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs. It should also ensure equal participation in international affairs and equal right to development, especially for developing countries. China advocates that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and other recognized international legal norms should be the political foundation of a new international order. In March 1999, President Jiang Zemin fully expounded China's basic propositions regarding the establishment of a new international political and economic order during his visit to Switzerland.
In the 1990s, an important aspect of China's multilateral diplomacy was the negotiation to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). Due to historical reasons, New China did not participate in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for a period of time after its establishment. After implementing the policy of reform and opening up, in July 1986, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision to apply for the resumption of China's status as a contracting party to GATT and immediately established a specialized organization to coordinate the external negotiation work. China's "resumption of GATT membership" and the negotiation to join the WTO have always been conducted under the leadership of the Party Central Committee. Throughout the 15-year negotiation process, China has consistently adhered to three principles: that the WTO, as an international organization, is incomplete without the participation of China, the largest developing country; that China can only participate as a developing country; and that China's accession to the WTO must be balanced in terms of rights and obligations. After continuous efforts and difficult negotiations, China ultimately reached an agreement with the relevant parties. On November 10, 2001, at the fourth ministerial conference of the WTO held in Doha, the capital of Qatar, the decision on China's accession to the WTO was deliberated and adopted unanimously through consultations. China's accession took a big step toward making the WTO a truly global trade organization and had a significant impact on China's economic system reform and economic development.
In the 1990s, China initiated and participated in a series of regional multilateral organizations with an open attitude. China explicitly expressed support for regional dialogue and cooperation based on equal participation, consensus through consultation, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and gradual progress. China actively promoted the establishment of multilateral confidence-building measures with neighboring countries, maintained regional security and stability, and promoted regional economic development. In October 2001, the ninth APEC Leaders' Informal Meeting was held in Shanghai. This was the highest-level and largest-scale international conference ever hosted by China. The successful holding of this conference has played a positive role in promoting economic recovery and development in the Asia-Pacific region.
At the beginning of the 21st century, although the international situation was volatile, the overall trend of development did not change. The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November 2002 pointed out that peace and development are still the themes of our times. Maintaining world peace and promoting common development are the common aspirations of people of all countries and an unstoppable historical trend. The development of multipolarization and economic globalization has brought opportunities and favorable conditions for world peace and development. A new world war is unlikely to break out in the foreseeable future, and it is possible to strive for a long period of peaceful international environment and a favorable surrounding environment. China will uphold the purpose of maintaining world peace and promoting common development, and consistently pursue an independent and peaceful diplomatic policy.
V. Actively promote China's military reform with Chinese characteristics
Placing the foundation of military struggle readiness on winning local wars under the conditions of high-tech and informationization, and strengthening the quality of the military, these are the new military strategic guidelines established by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China based on changes in the world military development trend in the 1990s and the new century. This strategic guideline is a further development based on the foundation of the 1980s, and it is more in line with the technological background of the 1990s and the requirements of military strategic development.
1. Establishing China's military strategic guidelines under high-tech conditions
In the early 1990s, two significant changes occurred in the world military situation: the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of one of the two military alliances, the Warsaw Pact. The second change was the revolutionary development in the use of high-tech, represented by microelectronics and information science, in the military field. The first change made large-scale wars even more unlikely, and the probability of local wars increased. The second change led to an ongoing military revolution. The war model of the industrial age characterized by the pouring of steel and iron will become a thing of the past, and the competition between high-tech and informationization in armaments will continue to flourish. In this trend, countries around the world have accelerated military reforms, striving to establish a lean and efficient armed force that is of high quality and limited in quantity but adequate.
In view of the new situation, the new central military commission core led by Jiang Zemin promptly made another significant adjustment to China's national defense strategy. At the expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission held in early 1993, it was decided to place the strategic guideline of our military on winning local wars under modern technological, especially high-tech, conditions, accelerate the quality construction of the People's Liberation Army, and enhance emergency combat capabilities. In order to implement the new strategic guidelines, the Central Military Commission also put forward the "two fundamental transformations" with the "strengthening the military through science and technology" as the central idea, namely, the transformation from dealing with local wars under general conditions to winning local wars under modern technological, especially high-tech, conditions; in terms of military construction, the transition from a model based on quantity and scale to one based on quality and efficiency, and from a labor-intensive model to a technology-intensive model. This is the second adjustment of the national defense strategic guidelines conducted by our military since the 1990s.
High-tech requires high investment as a strong support, while national development requires the army to "endure" and "live through difficult times in the next few years." In response to this contradiction, China's defense research and equipment have taken a path of concentrating limited financial and material resources in the main direction for a considerable period of time, to ensure that in the event of any conflict, there is "the ability to fight back" against any strong enemy. However, the cost of doing so is that the overall level of military equipment has slowed down once again, and the gap between the equipment level of developed countries in the world has further widened.
After assuming the position of Chairman of the Military Commission, Jiang Zemin's immediate task was to determine how to build our own army according to higher standards, in order to accelerate the pace of military construction and adjust the military strategic direction in response to changes in the new situation and new tasks.
In December 1990, shortly after Jiang Zemin assumed the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission, he put forward the general requirements for military construction under the new situation at an important military work conference held by the General Staff, namely: "politically qualified, militarily competent, strict discipline, effective support, and good work style." These five sentences constitute the fundamental direction of military construction in the new era, and also cover the basic content of military construction. This is an inheritance and development of the general guideline and overall task proposed by Deng Xiaoping in 1981 to "build a strong, modern, and regular revolutionary army."
After the formulation of the general requirements for military construction, the next major issue to be addressed is the proposal of the military strategic direction under the new situation. In this regard, shortly after Jiang Zemin assumed the position of Chairman of the Military Commission, he proposed that military strategy is ultimately the art of governing a country. A country and a nation cannot survive and develop, and cannot establish a firm foothold in fierce international competition without a correct military strategic direction.
So, in which direction should the new military strategic direction be adjusted? This is the immediate issue faced by the new Military Commission. In this regard, on November 9, 1992, Jiang Zemin explicitly stated at a military work conference that the international situation is developing rapidly now, and we must closely observe and grasp the development and changes in the situation in order to correctly decide our military strategic direction.
Based on Jiang Zemin's thoughts, the Military Commission convened a symposium on military strategic issues in December of that year. After sufficient brewing and discussion, Major General Zhang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Military Commission, made a preliminary summary of the new military strategic direction in his concluding speech at the symposium: to be based on the ability to win a local war under high-tech conditions. After this symposium, the General Staff organized multiple research investigations according to the intention of the Military Commission, and the Standing Committee of the Military Commission also had multiple discussions, ultimately achieving a unified understanding.
In early 1993, an expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission was held, during which Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Central Military Commission, formally proposed the military strategic direction of our military under the new situation, which is: "to make the foundation of military combat readiness focus on winning local wars under modern technology, especially high-tech conditions.
2. Promote military reform under the direction of "winning" and "no deterioration" in the face of a new situation. 
Guided by the overall requirements for military construction and the general principles of military strategy in the 1990s, the Central Military Commission led the whole army in carrying out continuous and in-depth reforms in various aspects of the military and national defense construction, with the direction of "winning" and "no deterioration" and the goal of building a quality army and strengthening the military with science and technology.
(1) Further strengthen the ideological and political construction of the military. The most important aspect of implementing the overall requirements for military construction in the new era is unwaveringly adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military and placing ideological and political work in the first place in all aspects of the army's work.
After the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission made its first decision to reaffirm the tradition of carrying forward the spirit of the old Red Army and adhering to the principle of the Party commanding the gun. Wide-ranging and in-depth education on adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military was carried out throughout the army, which strengthened the obedience of Party leadership among the majority of officers and soldiers and their conscious adherence to the Party's basic line.
After the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the unified arrangements of the Party Central Committee, the entire army conducted learning and education activities with the main content of "learning, politics, and ethics" in a top-down manner and in stages, and conducted widespread education activities on the important thought of "Three Represents". The General Political Department and the General Staff Headquarters also formulated a series of resolutions and regulations, such as the "Opinions of the General Political Department on Strengthening the Education and Management of Middle and Senior Cadres in the Army," "Opinions on Implementing the CCP Central Committee's Decision on Strengthening and Improving Party Conduct and Party Building," and "Decisions on Several Issues Regarding Political and Ideological Construction of the Army under the Conditions of Reform, Opening Up and Developing the Socialist Market Economy," etc. The ideological and political work of the whole army was focused on ensuring that the Party truly grasps the army in terms of ideology and politics, continuously enhancing the consciousness and firmness of listening to the Party and following the Party. In-depth work was carried out in theoretical arming, patriotic dedication education, revolutionary outlook education, respect for cadres and love for soldiers, and hard work education. The comprehensive implementation of the "Outline for the Construction of Grassroots Units of the Army" was carried out, with efforts put into consolidating the foundation of unit construction and other aspects, and ensuring practical results.
From 1992 to 2001, the whole army held nearly ten thousand theoretical study classes, and 85% of battalion-level and above cadres received rotational training. The enthusiasm of grassroots officers and soldiers was greatly enhanced through activities of striving for excellence and creating superiority, and 60,000 advanced units and 3.6 million outstanding soldiers emerged from the activities of "striving to be an advanced company and striving to be an excellent soldier". Strong ideological and political work safeguarded the coordinated development and overall progress of military construction.
(2) Reform the command structure of the People's Liberation Army of China. The military reforms in the 1990s were comprehensive and included various aspects, with the establishment of the General Armament Department as a symbol, and various reforms were comprehensively promoted. These reforms included the reform of the command structure of our military, symbolized by the establishment of the General Armament Department; the reform of the education and training system with the purpose of "winning"; and the reform of the logistical support system of our military, symbolized by the joint logistics of the three services.
On April 5, 1998, the General Equipment Department of the People's Liberation Army of China was formally established. This marked a significant reform in the structure of our military's command organs. For a long time, our military's command organs consisted of three headquarters, but now it has been restructured to consist of four headquarters. The establishment of the General Equipment Department means that under the guidance of the new military strategic policy, the People's Liberation Army will pay more attention than ever before to the development and improvement of weaponry and equipment. Weapons and equipment are the material foundation for achieving victory, and the establishment of the General Equipment Department has great significance in strengthening the leadership, unified management, and overall planning of the scientific research, production, and development of weapons and equipment.
To address the contradiction between the practical needs of the military and the overall national economic development, Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military Commission put forward a very insightful idea: to prioritize, to do some things and not do others, to catch up in certain areas and not in others, and to accelerate the development of "killer weapons" that would make the enemy afraid. Under this guiding principle, after ten years of efforts, our military has achieved modernization upgrades in major weapons such as main battle tanks, naval vessels, and combat aircraft; it has also developed its own distinctive features in certain missiles and counter-stealth technologies; and it has made remarkable achievements in the field of aerospace that have attracted worldwide attention.
(3) To improve the military's education and training system and further reduce troop numbers. The fundamental factor that determines the outcome of wars is personnel, and the quality of personnel is crucial to the outcome of modern warfare, especially in localized conflicts under high-tech conditions. Since the 1990s, the entire military has carried out a series of powerful reforms in the education and training system for military personnel.
In order to cultivate important military talents, the Central Military Commission has made major adjustments to the military's institutional system. In order to meet the needs of winning localized wars under high-tech conditions and develop talents for building a strong army through science and technology, five comprehensive universities have been newly established: National University of Defense Technology, Institute of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Naval University of Engineering, and Air Force Engineering University. The training of military personnel has also moved away from the previous singular approach and gradually adopted a path of self-training and reliance on national education. More than 50 universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, have undertaken the task of training cadres for the military and provide a large number of outstanding talents to the military every year.
According to statistics from 2002, there were already more than 30,000 cadres in the military with doctoral or master's degrees. The proportions of personnel at the army, division, and regiment levels with at least a college education were 88%, 90%, and 75% respectively, and the proportion of officers with at least a college degree in the entire military was 71.8%.
Another important measure for building a quality army and a technologically strong military is the reduction of troop numbers and the pursuit of China's own distinct elite force. In September 1997, at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin announced that, based on the previous reduction of 1 million troops in the 1980s, China would further reduce troop numbers by another 500,000 within three years. This major strategic decision was made in response to new changes in the international situation and the internal laws of military construction.
After the massive demobilization of more than one million troops since 1985, the total strength of the People's Liberation Army (including civilian personnel) is still slightly over three million. This number is obviously still relatively high, but large-scale demobilization is constrained by various factors both inside and outside the military. It is not possible to achieve it overnight, but rather to proceed with planned and step-by-step measures. The reduction of 500,000 troops is a specific arrangement to firmly and prudently decrease the quantity of the military and improve its quality. Its subsequent effects will not only be a simple reduction in numbers, but also, with the deepening of reform, the military's system and quality construction will reach a new level, and overall combat effectiveness will inevitably be enhanced. By 2002, the total number of personnel in the People's Liberation Army (including active and reserve forces) remained below 2.5 million.
(4) All commercial activities of the military and armed police forces shall be abolished. Since the reform and opening-up, the military has been subordinate to the overall situation of national economic construction and has been living a frugal life. In order to solve economic difficulties, the military and armed police forces have been engaged in productive and commercial activities for a period of time. The funds obtained were mostly used to improve the living and working conditions, as well as training conditions, of the troops. However, as time went on, some negative impacts gradually emerged, mainly including the dispersion of the attention of leaders at all levels on their work and the proliferation of corruption.
Shortly after Jiang Zemin assumed the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission, he pointed out that the military should eat "state-provided food". To this end, the Central Military Commission took measures to gradually shrink and clean up the military's production and business activities, and finally, according to unified arrangements, in July 1998, all commercial activities were ceased. Within the specified time limit, the military and armed police forces transferred thousands of business enterprises and companies to localities or had them revoked. The troops fully implemented the orders of the Central Military Commission, demonstrating the consistent good style of the military's obedience to the overall situation and strict discipline.
After the military and armed police forces ceased all commercial activities, in order to guarantee the troops' livelihood, especially the livelihood of grassroots officers and soldiers, and create favorable conditions for them to serve and dedicate themselves to national defense, the state allocated a huge special fund for this purpose. The various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army follow the principle of directing funds towards combat forces, border defense forces, and grassroots units. Since the 1990s, more than 1.6 billion yuan have been invested successively to implement supporting governance projects for the living facilities of troops stationed in remote and harsh regions. Many border guard posts and highland and island units now have standardized barracks, fresh vegetables, hot showers, and access to television. Non-commercial agricultural and sideline productions of the troops have not been weakened, but have instead been strengthened. In the implementation of the "basket of vegetables" project, more than half of the units in the military have achieved a self-sufficiency rate of over 70% for essential food supplies, and a considerable number of units have basically achieved self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables. In order to improve the cultural life of grassroots officers and soldiers, the various headquarters have also earmarked funds to greatly improve grassroots cultural facilities and promote the development of grassroots cultural activities.
(5) Strengthen the rule of law in the military. In view of the new situations and problems brought to the construction of the military by the social environment of developing the socialist market economy, the Military Commission emphasized the importance of governing the military by law during the reform in the 1990s. In addition to revising the traditional three major regulations (namely, internal affairs regulations, discipline regulations, and combat regulations) according to the development of the situation, the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have also successively formulated and promulgated a series of laws, regulations, and rules. These include specialized laws related to the military and national defense construction, such as the National Defense Law, the Conscription Law, the Active Military Officer Law, and the Military Facilities Protection Law; and more than a thousand military regulations, including the Regulations on Enlistment, the Regulations on Defense Transportation, the Regulations on Headquarters, the Regulations on Political Work, the Regulations on Logistics, and the Regulations on Weapon and Equipment Management. In addition, the corresponding regulations and rules formulated by the General Staff Headquarters, various branches of the military, and major military regions amount to over two thousand.
After completing three consecutive five-year plans for popularizing legal knowledge, the entire army launched the fourth five-year plan for popularizing legal education in 2001. In the process of legal education, with military regulations as the focus, the entire army conducted extensive learning of legal knowledge. Many grassroots units in the military also carried out legal consultation activities during the popularization process, helping officers and soldiers solve legal issues encountered in their daily lives, and learning to use legal means to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of military personnel and their families, thus consciously enhancing their awareness of the rule of law. By the turn of the century, the military and national defense construction had basically achieved the availability of laws and regulations to follow. The military construction has been institutionalized, effectively guaranteeing and promoting the modernization and standardization of the military.
Apart from the aforementioned reforms, the People's Liberation Army has also carried out a series of reforms in the conscription system, the military officer service system, the military housing system, the military insurance system, and the operational command system. Through these reforms, the overall political and military quality of the armed forces has been significantly improved.
3. The Path of Elite Soldiers with Chinese Characteristics in the Informationized Era
Entering the 21st century, a series of new changes have occurred in the international and domestic environments. Informationization has occupied an increasingly prominent position in the field of high technology, which is the prominent feature of this change. In response to this change, the Central Military Commission timely adjusted the military strategic policy, transforming the objective of winning local wars under modern conditions, especially under high-tech conditions, to winning local wars under informationized conditions. At the same time, the "Three Provides and One Enhances" development goals for military construction were put forward. This further realized the advancement of the military strategic thinking of the Communist Party of China, forming the latest achievements of Marxist military thought and promoting this ideology to a new height in the new century and new stage.
Since the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the United States has been attempting to dominate the world alone in its foreign policy, which has sharp conflicts with the efforts of many countries, including China, advocating for a multipolar world. For a period of time, due to the lack of effective constraints on the United States in the world, it almost acted wantonly across the globe. According to statistical data, during this period, the United States intervened in the internal affairs of other countries using military force twice as much as during the Cold War. Its enhanced soft power also greatly exceeded the level during the US-Soviet rivalry.
In recent years, with rapid development in China, the United States' containment and suppression of China has become increasingly prominent in various aspects. There is contact, cooperation, struggle, and compromise between China and the United States. The competition between the two extends to politics, economy, military, diplomacy, and other areas.
Since the opening-up and reform, the high-speed development of the Chinese economy has not only brought great progress to China but also made significant contributions to the development of the world economy. This is the consensus of most countries today. However, not everyone is pleased with this. Some hostile forces always try their best to obstruct China's development and set up numerous hidden obstacles. At the same time, with the development of economic globalization, the integration of economies among countries is accelerating, and the interdependence of industries and businesses has become a global trend. In today's era of economic and technological advancement, the extension of national interests has also expanded. In the agricultural era, national interests were limited to the territory; in the industrial era, they expanded to the sea; after World War II, they spread to the sky; in the high-tech era, the collision of national interests extended to space, and in the present information age, it further penetrates into the electromagnetic field. The expansion of the borders of national interests requires the military's functions to also extend to provide a strong security guarantee and effective strategic support for maximizing national interests.
The development and changes in the international situation and military conditions quickly attracted high attention from our military. On January 1, 2002, the Liberation Army Daily mentioned in an article, "In the new year, we will continue to focus on the issue of joint operations in the information age, emphasizing the study of the basic theory of joint operations, especially the theory and practice of foreign joint operations, striving to reflect the general laws of joint operations, and proposing countermeasures in terms of cultivating joint operation talents and training joint operations. Improve the joint operational capabilities of our armed forces." Looking at the historical task of national reunification, the situation of national reunification in China after entering the new century is still not optimistic. The Taiwan independence forces are extremely rampant in activities on the island and continuously provoke the bottom line of peaceful reunification. While making every effort to strive for peaceful reunification of the motherland, we must be prepared for military struggle at any time.
These new characteristics of the era pose higher requirements on the functions of our military. On September 20, 2004, at the expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission, the just-retired Chairman of the Military Commission, Jiang Zemin, pointed out, "We must have a broad vision and a forward-looking perspective, adhere to innovation, innovation, and further innovation, actively respond to the severe challenges of the new global military revolution, promote China's military transformation with a sense of urgency, strive to accomplish the dual historical tasks of mechanization and informatization, and firmly achieve the strategic goal of building an informatized military and winning an informatized war."
Hu Jintao, who had just taken over as Chairman of the Military Commission, also demanded at the same meeting that the entire army "continuously improve the ability to strengthen the ideological and political construction of the troops and grasp the correct direction of troop construction, continuously improve the leadership of military preparedness and the ability to lead the troops in accomplishing operational tasks in an informationized environment, continuously improve the ability to promote China's military transformation and advance the mechanization and informatization construction of the troops, and continuously improve the ability to govern the troops strictly according to law and strengthen the regularized construction of the troops."
In 2004, China's Defense White Paper officially announced to the outside world: "The People's Liberation Army focuses on winning local wars under the conditions of informatization, emphasizing the enhancement of weapons and equipment, joint operational capability, and battlefield construction. It adheres to the people's war concept, and develops the strategy and tactics of the people's war. Establish a modern combat system that can fully exert the overall effectiveness of the armed forces and the national war potential in order to meet the requirements of integrated joint operations." At this point, our military has begun the transformation of the third military strategy in the new era, that is, from winning local wars under modern technology, especially high-tech conditions, to winning local wars under informationized conditions.
According to the requirements of this new military strategy, President Hu Jintao, on behalf of the Central Military Commission, made timely adjustments to the historical mission of our military. On March 13, 2005, President Hu Jintao made an important speech at the plenary meeting of the 10th National People's Congress of the People's Liberation Army delegation, demanding that the military "provide an important guarantee of power for the Party to consolidate its ruling status, provide strong security guarantees for maintaining the country's important strategic opportunities, provide powerful strategic support for safeguarding national interests, and play an important role in safeguarding world peace and promoting common development." These "three provisions and one role" embody the new requirements of the Party's historical tasks for our military, adapt to the new changes in our country's security situation, reflect the new needs of national development strategies, conform to the new trends in world military development, grasp the major issues that affect the overall and fundamental nature of military construction, further expand the functional tasks of our military, clarify the development goals of national defense and military construction, improve the standards of military preparedness, and enrich the guiding principles for the use of military forces. President Hu Jintao's important discourse, which is in line with the important thoughts of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin regarding the historical mission of our military, is also keeping pace with the times. It is a significant innovation in the Party's military guidance theory, marking that our Party's understanding of the laws governing national defense and military construction in the new century and new stage has reached a new level.
The new mission entrusted to the People's Liberation Army by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission has epoch-making significance. In the past, the understanding of the historical mission of the Communist Party of China on the people's army was relatively vague. It was only generally believed that the military was the "strong pillar" of the people's democratic dictatorship and the "Great Wall of steel" defending the motherland. But the new historical mission is no longer just based on a political belief. It is based on the commanding height of the times and comprehensively examines the functions and roles of the current Chinese armed forces from a broader and deeper perspective.
Although the four aspects covered by the new historical mission are not completely new propositions, linking these four important propositions into a tight logical relationship is a first in history. The party commanding the gun is the basic principle of the establishment of the people's army; Marxist state theory believes that the military is the main component of the state. Based on these two basic principles, in a country under the people's democratic dictatorship, the armed forces must firmly be controlled by the ruling proletarian party and play an important role in its effective rule. The repeated experiences and lessons from both positive and negative aspects have proven that firmly grasping these two points will lead to the development of the socialist cause. Conversely, under the encirclement, attacks, and temptations of hostile forces both domestically and internationally, the party and the nation's cause are at the risk of being overthrown, and the interests of the people will suffer greatly. When we face a complex international environment and a period of multiple internal contradictions, the military's role in providing an important guarantee of power for the Party to consolidate its ruling status becomes especially important.
China's modernization cannot be achieved without a good international environment. Especially today, when the trend of global economic globalization is becoming stronger, defending world peace is also defending our own development. In the past, our comprehensive national strength was not strong enough, so we particularly emphasized seizing the opportunity for peace to develop ourselves. Now, we have a certain foundation, capability, and the necessity to create a peaceful and harmonious international environment by joining forces with all the forces that love and uphold peace in the world. The Central Military Commission has entrusted our military with the function of "playing an important role in safeguarding world peace and promoting common development," which can be said to be timely.
Chapter 10: Promote the new great project of party building and the formation of the important thought of the "Three Represents"
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, the party vigorously promoted the construction of socialist modernization and continuously pushed forward the new great project of party building. Through continuous summarization of the experience in socialist modernization and party building, the important thought of the "Three Represents" was gradually formed. The important thought of the "Three Represents" is the further enrichment and development of the theory of Marxist socialist construction and the party building doctrine in the new historical conditions. It is another important achievement in the process of Marxist sinicization of the Communist Party of China. This important thought fully reflects the new changes in historical development at home and abroad and the new requirements of the times, and it plays an extremely important guiding role in the development of various aspects of contemporary China. It is because of this that the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China officially established it as the guiding ideology of the party.
I. Further clarify the overall goal and overall tasks of party building and continue to promote the new great project
In the 1990s, the Communist Party of China encountered the new situation of socialist market economy in the process of reform and development. Under the conditions of socialist market economy, the construction of the party, how to build the party, and what goals to build the party according to have become new topics for the Communist Party of China. In response to this, the third-generation central leadership collective with Jiang Zemin at the core, based on the principles of Marxist party building and taking into account China's objective reality, creatively put forward the overall goal and overall tasks of party building under the conditions of socialist market.
1. New requirements posed by reform and development of market economy on party building
Combining the socialist system with the market economy is not only a great achievement but also a brand new topic and challenge. Strengthening the party building under the conditions of socialist market economy is not only an unprecedented cause for the Communist Party of China, but also a new challenge.
The development of the socialist market economy aims at the fundamental problem of how to transition from planned economy to market-oriented economy. This transition will inevitably bring profound changes to all sectors of society, including both positive influences and negative effects on party building.
The positive influences of the market economy on party building are mainly manifested in the following aspects: Firstly, the basic law followed by the market economy is the law of value. It emphasizes the principle of material interests and insists on putting efficiency at the center. Acting in accordance with this law is conducive to the party organizations and the majority of party members to further establish the concept of seeking truth from facts and working style, overcome the tendencies of formalism, deception, and detachment from reality. Secondly, the diversification of market entities, the diversification of transaction methods, and the value orientation of giving priority to efficiency and taking into account fairness are conducive to the party organizations and the majority of party members to maintain and carry forward a good mental state of striving upwards and fighting tenaciously, and overcome the ideological style of clinging to the old and being content with the status quo. Third, the openness and fairness of market competition are conducive to enhancing the democratic consciousness of party organizations and party members, overcoming the practice of "one-man rule" and subjective decision-making. Fourth, the unity and openness of the market system are conducive to party organizations and party members learning from and drawing on beneficial experiences from other regions and countries, overcoming closed and conservative thinking, and enhancing openness. Fifth, the market economy is a rule-of-law economy, and the relationships of responsibilities, rights, and obligations between various market behaviors and market entities need to be regulated by laws and regulations. This regulation is conducive to strengthening the ideological construction of party organizations and party members, overcoming the tendency to act without following rules and not abiding by party discipline. Sixth, the market economy mainly relies on indirect regulation through the market and does not emphasize direct administrative intervention. This is conducive to correctly handling the relationship between the party and the government and overcoming the practice of substituting the party for the government.
The negative effects of the socialist market economy on party building mainly manifest in the following aspects: First, the market economy emphasizes material interests. Under the drive of material interests, people's worldviews, outlooks on life, and values are prone to certain distortions, giving rise to materialism, hedonism, and individualism. Some individuals may even lose their party principles and engage in power and money transactions, thereby damaging the image of the party. This makes the task of educating the party's ideals, beliefs, worldviews, outlooks on life, and values more arduous under market economy conditions. Second, in terms of operational methods, the prominent characteristic of the market economy is the horizontal connection between market entities, and this connection has a strong spontaneity and dispersiveness. This easily downplays party members' overall and organizational awareness and breeds decentralism and anarchism, thereby increasing the difficulty of party members' organizational management work. Third, the market economy is an open economy, which not only manifests as internal openness but also requires external openness, connecting domestic and international markets, and participating in international division of labor and competition as much as possible in order to achieve more efficient allocation of domestic resources and utilization of international resources. On one hand, this openness promotes the accelerated flow of populations, and on the other hand, it is easy for foreign thoughts and cultures to spread and spread with the expansion of opening up. This results in instability within the party members' ranks and also poses difficulties for the work of unifying party members' thinking.
For party building, the socialist market economy is a double-edged sword, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Facing these opportunities and challenges, the Communist Party of China must adapt to the new requirements of changing circumstances, clearly propose the overall goals and tasks of party building that meet the requirements of the socialist market economy in practice, so as to continuously strengthen its own construction with the development of the times, thereby improving its ability to manage the market economy and consolidate its ruling position.
2. Further clarify the overall goals and tasks of party building
Clarifying the overall goals and tasks of party building is the primary issue in the construction of a ruling party. After the Communist Party of China came to power, it went through a long exploration to establish the correct goal of party building. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as the focus of the party's work shifted, it was proposed to build the party into a strong core leading the socialist modernization cause, thus clarifying the direction of party building throughout the entire socialist historical period. Following the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's political instructions to "focus on party building," earnestly summarized the experience and lessons of party building since the reform and opening up, actively explored new ways to strengthen party building under the conditions of developing the socialist market economy, and clearly proposed the overall goals and tasks of party building.
The overall goal and task of the party's construction are gradually formed by the central leadership collective with Jiang Zemin as the core through strengthening and improving the party's construction practice. In August 1989, the central government issued a notice on strengthening the party's construction, which required party committees at all levels to resolve urgent issues in the party's construction in accordance with the requirements of the party's basic line, so that the party could withstand the test of governance under new historical conditions, the test of reform, opening-up, and the development of a commodity economy, as well as the test of opposing peaceful evolution. In March 1990, the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on strengthening the party's connection with the masses emphasized that our party and country are currently in a crucial period of historical development. In general, our party's relationship with the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses are good. However, in recent years, serious corruption phenomena of party members and cadres being detached from the masses have also emerged. Therefore, all party members must remain highly vigilant and persistently struggle against these phenomena. In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, based on the need to develop a socialist market economy, highlighted the tasks of learning Deng Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, strengthening party construction, closely connecting with the masses, strengthening grassroots organization construction, and adhering to and improving the democratic centralism from the perspective of strengthening the party's construction.
To implement the various tasks of the party's construction proposed by the 14th National Congress, and to make the party's construction adapt to the reform of building a socialist market economic system, the 4th Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in September 1994 made the "Decision on Strengthening Several Key Issues in Party Construction" (referred to as the "Decision"). The "Decision" clearly puts forward the overall goal and task of the new great project of party construction, that is, "building the party into a Marxist party armed with the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, wholeheartedly serving the people, being completely consolidated in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, being able to withstand various risks, and always leading in the forefront of the times". Based on this overall goal and task, the "Decision" requires that while continuing to implement the Central Committee's deployment on ideological and style construction, special attention should be paid to the central link of party organization construction, and particularly the three issues should be addressed: first, adhering to and improving the democratic centralism, with particular emphasis on institutional construction; second, strengthening and improving the construction of grassroots organizations of the party; third, cultivating and selecting leaders who possess both moral integrity and talent, especially young cadres. Emphasizing institutional construction is an important feature of the "Decision" adopted at this meeting.
In September 1997, the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China summarized the new experience of party construction and further summarized the overall goal and task of party construction proposed at the 4th Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee as follows: "Build the party into a Marxist party armed with Deng Xiaoping Theory, wholeheartedly serving the people, being completely consolidated in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, being able to withstand various risks, always leading in the forefront of the times, and leading the people of the whole country to build socialism with Chinese characteristics." The conference called on the whole party to comprehensively strengthen the party's construction in terms of ideology, organization, and style in accordance with the overall goal of the new great project of party construction, continuously improve leadership capabilities, enhance the ability to resist corruption, prevent transformation, and resist risks, and lead the people to fulfill new historical tasks with a new appearance and greater combat effectiveness.
3. Initial Implementation of the Party's Overall Goal and Task
After the 4th Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, the party's construction gradually unfolded in various aspects such as ideology, politics, and organization in accordance with the requirements of the overall goal and task.
In terms of ideological construction, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China established the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory in building socialism with Chinese characteristics across the whole party, and put forward the strategic task of arming the whole party with this theory. After the publication of Volumes 1, 2, and 3 of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" in 1993 and 1994, the Central Committee immediately issued a notice requiring the whole party to organize the study seriously. From the end of 1993 to May 1994, the central government organized 175 key leaders from the party, government, military, and experts and scholars from various departments in four batches to participate in the theoretical seminar for provincial and ministerial-level key leaders at the Central Party School, and they carefully studied "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping". In order to further promote cadre training, in May 1996, the central government formulated the "1996-2000 National Cadre Education and Training Plan" and made comprehensive deployments to strengthen ideological and theoretical education for cadres.
In the process of carrying out theoretical studies throughout the party, a complete set of learning systems has gradually been established. For example, party committee members at and above the county level regularly participate in party school training, and there is a system for the central group of party committees to study. In addition, various levels of organizations have also adopted various forms such as organizing lecture teams for guidance and holding theoretical seminars to promote extensive learning. These measures have stimulated the enthusiasm of party members and cadres to study theory, and promoted the improvement of the ideological and theoretical level of the whole party.
In terms of improving the democratic centralism, after the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the CPC Central Committee gradually increased its efforts to build democratic centralism within the party in response to the problems of insufficient democracy and centralism. In guaranteeing the democratic rights of party members, the internal democratic channels of the party have been opened up and broadened, allowing party members to participate more in internal party affairs. By establishing effective mechanisms, grassroots party members are guaranteed the timely ability to reflect their opinions to higher-level party organizations. Based on fully listening to the opinions of party members and lower-level party organizations, valuable opinions are collected to continuously promote the scientific and democratic decision-making process. In terms of decision-making procedures, the principle of "collective leadership, democratic centralism, individual deliberation, and decision-making through meetings" is followed to further improve the internal deliberation and decision-making mechanisms of party committees. In terms of leadership and governance styles, it is emphasized to follow the principle of overall planning and coordination among all parties, further strengthen and improve the leadership system of the party, ensuring both the leading core role of party committees and fully leveraging the roles of the people's congresses, governments, political consultative conferences, people's organizations, and other aspects. The implementation of this series of measures has gradually institutionalized and standardized the construction of the CPC's democratic centralism.
In terms of the construction of grassroots party organizations in rural areas, in 1990, the Central Organization Department held a meeting in Laixi, Shandong, which determined the core leadership position of party branches in village-level organizations. In 1992, the Central Organization Department held a meeting in Zhangqiu, Shandong, focusing on summarizing and promoting the experience of "establishing a system in accordance with the law, governing villages with systems, and democratic management", and promoting the institutionalization and standardization of grassroots organizations in rural areas with the party branch as the core. In 1994, under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on the construction of grassroots party organizations, the CPC Central Committee held the National Conference on the Construction of Grassroots Rural Organizations from October 26th to 29th in Beijing. On November 5th, the CPC Central Committee issued the "Notice on Strengthening the Construction of Grassroots Rural Organizations", clearly putting forward the requirements of the "five goods" for the construction of grassroots party organizations in rural areas, namely: building a good leadership team; cultivating and exercising a good team; choosing a good path for economic development; improving a good operational mechanism; and perfecting a good management system. Based on this, various regions have successively established and implemented the party building work responsibility system and the contact point system for leading cadres. Starting from 1994, the party's organizational departments have phased and batch rectification of 282,000 weak and disorganized party branches in rural areas and conducted phased training for rural party members and cadres, resulting in various degrees of improvement to about 80% of village-level party organizations.
In the construction of grassroots party organizations in state-owned enterprises, in December 1996, the CPC Central Organization Department, Central Policy Research Office, State Economic and Trade Commission, State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other units jointly held the National Conference on the Construction of Party in State-owned Enterprises in Beijing. In January 1997, the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued the "Notice on Further Strengthening and Improving the Party Construction in State-owned Enterprises," which made clear provisions on the goals, principles, and policies of the party organization construction in state-owned enterprises. In accordance with the spirit of this document, party committees at all levels, in the process of establishing a modern enterprise system, adhere to the party's political leadership over enterprises, play the political core role of the party organization in enterprises, adhere to the guideline of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, explore new approaches and methods of party building in relation to enterprise reform and development, and have achieved remarkable results, accumulating new experiences.
In terms of party construction in urban streets, in June 1995, some cadres from 16 provinces and cities across the country discussed how to strengthen the party organization construction at the grassroots level in Tianjin and summarized and exchanged experiences. One year later, based on various situations, the Organization Department of the Central Committee issued the "Opinions on Strengthening the Party Construction Work in Streets" on September 3, 1996, which required street party construction work to take into account the characteristics and realities of urban work in the new situation, focus on improving urban management and social services, maintaining social stability and developing street economy, with a focus on enhancing the construction of leadership teams and improving the quality of cadres, strengthening the cohesion and combativeness of party organizations, fully exerting the vanguard and exemplary role of party members, and serving the healthy development of material and spiritual civilization in urban areas. In accordance with this spirit, urban areas across the country gradually established a working network of party organizations in street community, enabling street community party organizations to play an increasingly important role in strengthening spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political work among the masses, improving comprehensive social security and governance, maintaining close ties with the masses, and raising the quality and level of urban civilization.
In terms of party construction in non-public economic organizations, further strengthening has also been achieved during this period. In areas with relatively developed non-public economic sectors, party organizations have been established in some foreign-invested enterprises and private enterprises, and the cohesion of party organizations and the vanguard and exemplary role of communist party members have been well demonstrated in these enterprises. In September 2000, based on extensive investigations and research and the summary of local practical experiences, the Organization Department of the Central Committee issued the "Opinions on Strengthening Party Construction in Individual and Private Non-public Economic Organizations (Trial)," in accordance with which, by June 2001, party organizations established in non-public enterprises nationwide had reached 44,000.
At the same time, the CPC Central Committee also put forward a series of new ideas and requirements for party construction in government departments, schools, research institutes, and other sectors, which universally strengthened the construction of grassroots party organizations under the new historical conditions.
While strengthening the construction of grassroots party organizations, party organizations at all levels have also generally strengthened the construction of the party membership. Following the guideline of "adhering to standards, improving the structure, cautious development, and ensuring quality," exceptional individuals from various fronts continuously enrich the party membership, injecting fresh blood into the party organization. The cohesion and creativity of party organizations have been continuously strengthened.
4. Uphold and improve the system of democratic centralism and strengthen the construction of democratic systems within the Party
Democratic centralism is a system that combines democracy on the basis of concentration and the concentration of leadership under democracy. It is the application of Marxist epistemology and the mass line in the Party's life and organizational construction. The democracy in democratic centralism refers to the full expression of the will and views of party members and party organizations and the full play of their enthusiasm and creativity; the concentration in democratic centralism refers to the unity of the will and wisdom of the entire Party and consistent actions.
In accordance with the tasks and requirements put forward at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Central Committee, in response to the insufficient democracy and concentration within the Party, has taken a series of measures to vigorously strengthen and improve the system of democratic centralism within the Party. On the one hand, it is insisted that the purpose of realizing the party's program is to guide, protect, and stimulate enthusiasm. It actively smooths and broadens the democratic channels within the party, so that party members can have a better understanding of and participation in internal party affairs. It is required that from the central committee to every branch, from decision-making in leadership organs to participating in policy discussions in party meetings and publications, from internal party elections to evaluating and supervising leading cadres, democracy must be fully promoted. In order to safeguard the democratic rights of party members, in December 1994, the Party Central Committee formulated and promulgated the "Regulations on the Protection of the Democratic Rights of Members of the Communist Party of China (Trial)", which clearly stipulated the principles for members to correctly exercise their rights and the measures to guarantee the exercise of their rights.
On the other hand, focusing on the overall work of the party, the party constitution is reiterated, emphasizing the "four obedience" and ensuring the smooth flow of orders from the central party, maintaining consistency with the central party on the fundamental principles, general policies, overall objectives, and major issues related to the overall situation. In order to strengthen and improve the leadership of the party, the central Party also proposed the principle of "collective leadership, democratic centralism, individual deliberation, and decision-making by meeting", further improving the internal decision-making mechanisms of party committees, establishing a sound decision-making mechanism combining leadership, experts, and the masses, gradually improving democratic and scientific decision-making systems. It insists on and improves the combination of collective leadership and individual division of labor and responsibility. It formulates regulations for the work of central and local party committees, further clarifying and standardizing the responsibilities, rules of procedure, and decision-making procedures of party committee meetings and standing committees. It improves the system of Party congresses, further playing the role of plenary meetings of central and local party committees. It improves the system of organizational life meetings and democratic life meetings of party members and leading cadres, and improves various guidelines for internal political life. It strengthens internal party supervision, strictly enforces party discipline, formulates internal party supervision regulations, improves the internal party supervision system, and combines internal party supervision with social supervision, public opinion supervision, and supervision from democratic parties and non-party individuals, gradually forming a strong supervision system. According to the principle of overall planning and coordination of all parties, it further strengthens and improves the party's leadership system, ensuring the core role of party committees while fully playing the role of the People's Congress, the government, the CPPCC, various mass organizations, and other aspects.
The implementation of these principles has gradually institutionalized and standardized the construction of the party's democratic centralism.
5. Carry out the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" education and explore new ways to strengthen party building
On the journey to the new century, facing the new situation and new tasks of deepening reform and opening up, the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, on the basis of a thorough summary of the party's historical experience, created a new form of party conduct and discipline education centered on the spirit of rectification and with the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" (being strict with oneself in morals and self-discipline, being strict with one's work, and being strict with money and material) as the main content, and achieved remarkable results.
In 1995, Jiang Zemin repeatedly mentioned the need to educate cadres on learning, politics, and integrity, in response to some cadres who neglected studying and self-improvement under the new situation of developing a market economy and lost their way in increasingly complex struggles, eventually becoming corrupt. This requirement immediately received high attention from party committees at all levels, and the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" gradually became an important content for educating party members and cadres. In 1998, the Central Organization Department, in conjunction with relevant departments, after repeated investigations and solicitations of opinions, formulated the implementation plan for the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" education.
On November 21 of the same year, the central government issued the "Opinions on Carrying Out Party Conduct and Discipline Education with 'Learning, Politics, and Integrity' as the Main Content among Party and Government Leading Groups and Leading Cadres at County Level and Above", comprehensively arranging the implementation of the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" education. Since then, the "Three Stricts and Three Honests" education has gradually been launched in stages and batches.
This "Three Stricts and Three Honests" education was carried out from top to bottom. The central government, central state organs, provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and directly affiliated organs were the first to carry out pilot programs, followed by implementation at the city and county levels. On December 5, 1998, the Central Committee convened a national teleconference and Hu Jintao delivered a speech on the mobilization of the "Three Talks" education. Starting from that month, the Central Committee conducted pilot programs in Shandong, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, as well as the Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Education, State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television, and the Communist Youth League Central Committee. From the beginning of the pilot programs, the "Three Talks" in various units were carried out in four steps: ideological mobilization and learning improvement, self-analysis and soliciting opinions, exchange of ideas and criticism and self-criticism, and serious rectification and consolidation of achievements.
On March 19, 1999, in order to summarize and exchange the situation and experience of the pilot programs for the "Three Talks" education, and to study and deploy the next steps of work, the Central Committee held the first national conference on the "Three Talks" education. The conference listened to the pilot units' experience presentations and made arrangements for the first phase of the "Three Talks" education work. It was decided that the "Three Talks" in various provincial and ministerial units would be carried out in two batches. The first batch included 16 provinces, regions, and cities such as Beijing and Hubei, as well as 70 central and national agencies such as the Supreme People's Procuratorate. The second batch included 12 provinces, cities, and regions such as Zhejiang and Ningxia, as well as six ministry-level departments such as the Ministry of Finance.
The members of the Central Political Bureau Standing Committee attached great importance to the "Three Talks" education. At the end of 1999, they also dedicated time to study the "Three Talks". They carefully reviewed and summarized the work and basic experience of the past ten years since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. They engaged in profound thought on major strategic issues in future reforms and development. Comrades of the Standing Committee, with a high sense of responsibility to the Party, to the country, and to the people, took the lead in identifying shortcomings in their work, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and proposing improvement measures. They effectively promoted the deepening of the "Three Talks" education.
After the first national conference on the "Three Talks" education, the Central Committee held the second and third national conferences on the "Three Talks" education in June 1999 and January 2000, respectively, to make arrangements for the "Three Talks" work in each phase. Based on these arrangements, the Central Committee dispatched several inspection teams and inspection groups to various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and central government departments to understand the situation and strengthen guidance and inspection of the "Three Talks" education work. After the concentrated education on the "Three Talks" ended, localities and units organized and carried out "look-back" activities in accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee. These activities aimed to assess whether the consciousness of learning, politics, and integrity had truly improved, whether prominent problems reflected by the masses had been resolved, and whether there were significant improvements in the work of local regions and departments. This was done to consolidate and expand the achievements of the "Three Talks" education.
According to the deployment of the Central Committee, the "Three Talks" education at the county and city levels was also gradually implemented. In order to carry out this education well, members of the Central Political Bureau Standing Committee went to seven counties and cities for in-depth investigations and conducted specific guidance. On February 20, 2000, Jiang Zemin personally participated in the "Three Talks" education conference for the leadership cadres in Gaozhou City, Guangdong Province, and delivered a mobilization speech. These measures further demonstrated the high attention of the Party Central Committee to the "Three Talks" education and greatly promoted the "Three Talks" education at the county and city levels. By the end of September 2000, the "Three Talks" education for party and government leading teams at the county level and above throughout the country had basically come to an end and entered the stage of summarization and improvement, as well as in-depth rectification.
From 1998 to the end of 2000, a total of 700,000 party cadres participated in the "Three Talks" education. Cadres and the masses inside and outside the Party paid great attention to this educational activity and showed a high level of participation enthusiasm. There were more than 5 million people directly involved in listening to mobilization reports, participating in democratic evaluations, and assisting in rectification. Cadres have generally received profound Marxist education and undergone strict training in the inner-party democracy, which has significantly improved their adherence to the mass line and the democratic centralism of the party. Practice has shown that the "Three Teachings" education is a creative exploration and successful practice in strengthening the party building, especially the ideological and political construction of the leadership team and cadres. It enriches and promotes the spirit of rectification in Yan'an and the "Three Major Styles" of the party in the new historical period.
II. we need to cultivate and select leaders who possess both virtue and talent, and establish a high-quality cadre team. 
After the political line is determined, cadres become the determining factor. The cultivation and selection of leaders who possess both virtue and talent is the fundamental plan for the long-term stability of the party and the country. The work of building a high-quality cadre team began in the 1980s, and further accelerated in the 1990s.
In 1991, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a special decision on "strengthening the cultivation and education of young cadres," which clearly stated the need to strengthen strict requirements and management for young cadres, strengthen ideological and theoretical education, and provide them with practical experiences through exchanges and rotations. In October 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China explicitly proposed to cultivate and select successors of the socialist cause in accordance with the principles of the "four modernizations" of the cadre team and having both virtue and talent. In September 1994, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed two major strategic tasks: the cultivation and selection of leaders who possess both virtue and talent. At the same time, it also put forward four requirements for the reform of the cadre system: first, expanding the democracy in the selection and appointment of leaders. Whether elected or appointed, leaders must follow the mass line and involve the masses more through democratic recommendations, opinion tests, or democratic evaluations. Second, improve the evaluation system for leaders and align it with the system of promotion, demotion, rewards, and punishments. Third, earnestly implement the system of exchanging leaders and combine it with the system of term limits and the evasion system. Fourth, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the work of selecting and appointing leaders, resolutely prevent and correct irregularities in personnel matters. The principles proposed by the 14th National Congress and the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee clearly provide guiding opinions on the cultivation and selection of leaders who possess both virtue and talent from the perspectives of the 1990s. These principles and requirements are clearly oriented, fully reflect characteristics of democracy and openness, are easy to implement, and have strong guiding effects.
To implement the spirits of the 14th National Congress and the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, the National Organization Work Conference was held in Beijing from November 30 to December 3, 1994. The conference focused on studying and deploying the work of cultivating and selecting leaders who possess both virtue and talent, and strengthening the construction of leadership teams at all levels. On November 30, Hu Jintao delivered a report titled "Cultivate and Select Leaders Who Possess Both Virtue and Talent, and Build Leadership Teams at All Levels to Serve as Strong Collectives to Implement the Party's Basic Line." He proposed making comprehensive improvement in the quality of cadres at the county level and above as a focal point of future cadre work. On December 2, Jiang Zemin emphasized in his speech at the conference that in the current and future periods, cadre team construction must focus on completing two strategic tasks: first, comprehensively improving the quality of existing leaders and building leadership teams at the county level and above well; second, promptly cultivating and selecting outstanding young cadres, striving to cultivate a large number of leaders who can assume important responsibilities across the century. The speeches by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao further clarified the key work priorities for the cultivation and selection of leaders who possess both virtue and talent. In order to effectively strengthen the work of cultivating and selecting leading cadres, in January 1995, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued the "Notice of the Central Committee of the CPC on Intensifying the Training and Selection of Outstanding Young Cadres," requiring organizations at all levels to improve and strengthen the work of reserve cadres, so that there are sufficient reserve candidates for leadership teams at all levels; increase training efforts and comprehensively enhance the quality of young cadres; in the training and selection of young cadres, it is necessary to focus on the healthy growth of a generation. In accordance with the above-mentioned requirements, party committees at the central and local levels have generally strengthened the work of cadre training and education.
While strengthening cadre training and education, the work of rational selection of cadres was also put on the agenda. In January 1995, the Central Committee of the CPC issued a notice on the issue of training and selecting outstanding young cadres, clearly stating the goals, principles, and requirements for selecting young cadres. In February 1995, the Central Committee of the CPC issued the "Interim Regulations on the Selection and Appointment of Leading Cadres in Party and Government Organizations," which clearly stipulated the principles, conditions, procedures, and methods for selecting and appointing cadres in the form of regulations. On June 21, 1996, Jiang Zemin made an important speech titled "Efforts to Build a High-Quality Cadre Team" at a symposium commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, further proposing to improve the political and professional qualities of party cadres according to five criteria: First, they must have lofty communist ideals, adhere to the correct political direction, firmly follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and resolutely implement the Party's basic theories, basic lines, and various policies; second, they must strive to practice the purpose of the Party's wholehearted service to the people, maintain close contact with the masses, especially the working class and farmers, and resolutely safeguard the interests of the people; third, they must free their minds, seek truth from facts, proceed from the actual situation, be good at pioneering and advancing, and have a dialectical and materialistic thinking method and work method; fourth, they must exemplify observing discipline and upholding the law, maintain integrity and self-discipline, carry forward the spirit of hard work, consciously reject corruption and prevent deviation, and resolutely oppose negative and corrupt phenomena; fifth, they must study hard, work diligently and professionally, continuously accumulate knowledge and experience, and have the professional knowledge and abilities to do their jobs well.
After 1996, with the joint efforts of the central and local party committees, the work of cadre selection and appointment gradually moved towards institutionalization and standardization. In August 2000, the central government issued the "Outline of Deepening the Reform of Cadre Personnel System," which clearly stipulated the basic goals, principles and policies, as well as the reform of cadre personnel system in party and government organs and state-owned enterprise personnel system. In July 2002, based on the requirements of the new century, new stage, and new tasks, and on the basis of absorbing the achievements of the cadre personnel system reform since 1995, the central government revised and improved the "Interim Regulations on the Selection and Appointment of Leading Cadres in Party and Government Organizations," and promulgated the "Regulations on the Selection and Appointment of Leading Cadres in Party and Government Organizations," which made more scientific, standardized and rigorous regulations on the basic principles, procedures, methods, and aspects of expanding democracy and strengthening supervision in the selection and appointment of cadres, providing basic regulations and guarantees for preventing and governing irregularities in personnel management at the source, and promoting the institutionalization, democratization, and standardization of cadre work. In 2004, the central government further intensified the reform of the cadre personnel system, and successively issued five documents, including the "Interim Provisions on the Open Selection of Leading Cadres in Party and Government Organizations" and the "Interim Provisions on Competitive Selection and Placement of Party and Government Organs," and combined with the previously issued "Notice on the Cleanup of Party and Government Leaders Holding Concurrent Positions in Enterprises" in early 2004, which were collectively referred to as the "5+1" documents. These documents, together with the "Civil Servants Law of the People's Republic of China" issued in 2005, provide systematic and clear regulations for the selection and appointment of leading cadres. The promulgation of these policies and regulations further improves the selection and appointment system of leading cadres, and the work of selecting and appointing leading cadres has gradually moved towards institutionalization and standardization, thereby effectively guaranteeing the emergence of outstanding talents and timely cooperation and succession of leading cadres at all levels.
III. Strengthen Party Conduct and Intensify the Fight against Corruption
How can a political party maintain a healthy body? This has been a historical issue that Marxist thinkers have been striving for. Since the 1990s, with the development and changes in society, the Communist Party of China has gradually put forward and formed a set of institutions and ideas in the practice of combating corruption and advocating integrity. These institutions and ideas reflect the original development and creation of Chinese Communists in the process of Marxist Sinicization.
In the new stage of reform and opening up, as China transitions from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, due to the incomplete elimination of the drawbacks of the old system and the insufficient legal system, there are still some weak links in supervision and management. In addition, some regions and departments neglect ideological and political work, resulting in the spread and development of passive corruption in some party and government organs and law enforcement agencies.
In response to the severe situation of the fight against corruption, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have actively taken targeted measures. As early as the beginning of the reform and opening up, the Party began to pay attention to the problem of opposing wrongful practices. The 13th National Congress of the Party in 1987 formally put forward the guideline of "strictly governing the Party". After the 13th National Congress, a series of measures for building a clean government were gradually introduced. From August 20th to 25th, 1993, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection held its second plenary session in Beijing. Jiang Zemin proposed at the meeting that we should start from three aspects to do a good job in the fight against corruption: first, leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in being honest and self-disciplined; second, focus on investigating and handling a number of major cases, with particular emphasis on cases involving party and government leadership organs, judicial departments, administrative law enforcement departments, and personnel in economic management departments; third, firmly grasp the outstanding problems in the local area, within the department, and within the unit, and put an end to the few wrongful practices that the masses are most dissatisfied with. These three requirements directly targeted the "three organs and one department" - party and government leadership organs, leading cadres,and judicial organs, administrative law enforcement agencies, economic management departments, and their personnel. Based on Jiang Zemin's speech spirit and the needs of the fight against corruption, the plenary session formulated five provisions regarding the problem of corruption among county-level and above leading cadres: first, no engagement in business or intervening in paid intermediary activities, and no provision of any preferential conditions for spouses, children, and relatives to engage in business activities; second, no part-time positions (including honorary positions) in various economic entities, and those approved for individual cases should not receive any remuneration; not allowed to reimburse expenses that should be paid personally by subordinates and other enterprises and institutions; third, no buying or selling of stocks; fourth, no accepting gifts or various valuable securities in official activities; not allowed to accept credit cards presented by subordinate units and other institutions, and not allowed to use credit cards issued by the unit for personal use; fifth, no using public funds to obtain various forms of club memberships, and not allowed to participate in high-consumption entertainment activities using public funds.
On October 5th, 1993, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued a decision on implementing several tasks in the recent period regarding the fight against corruption, re-emphasizing the three tasks proposed at the second plenary session of the central disciplinary inspection commission and the "five provisions" for leading cadres. In February 1994, the third plenary meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. Based on the "Five Guidelines" proposed at the Second Plenary Session, the meeting once again put forward and reiterated the following requirements: 1. It is not allowed to violate regulations to purchase and replace imported luxury cars. It is not allowed to use authority to exchange, borrow, and allocate funds to purchase cars for enterprises and subordinate units. It is not allowed to use loans, fund-raising, and special funds to purchase small cars for leaders' use. County (city) party and government organs and units are not allowed to purchase small cars if they owe workers' wages. 2. It is not allowed to violate the regulations on housing system reform promulgated by the State Council to pressure purchase houses. It is not allowed to use authority to provide preferential conditions for oneself and one's children, relatives, and friends to purchase houses. It is not allowed to use public funds beyond the standard for personal house decoration. 3. Leaders should travel light and live frugally during domestic official activities. Accommodation and meals should not exceed the local reception standards. It is not allowed to hold special dance parties for leaders. 4. It is not allowed to waste public funds and resources through excessive celebration of personal and family weddings, funerals, weddings, job transfers, birthdays, and moving into new homes, let alone using public funds and resources to profit personally. 5. It is not allowed to use authority to withhold public funds without repayment. It is not allowed to use public funds to purchase houses for oneself and relatives or engage in profit-making activities. In May, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection also formulated the "New Five Guidelines" for clean and self-disciplined leadership. 
In order to further implement the above-mentioned work arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on fighting corruption, in June 1994, the Communist Party of China Central Committee decided to organize 20 investigation teams to conduct supervision and inspection at 24 central state organs and 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. Based on the investigations, in January 1995, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection made four additional provisions on clean and self-disciplined leadership: 1. It is not allowed to appropriate discounts, intermediary fees, and gifts received during business and management activities for personal use. It is not allowed to receive wages and bonuses for part-time positions in violation of regulations. 2. Personal private business and enterprise operation are not allowed. Providing various conveniences for family members and friends to operate businesses using authority is not allowed. 3. It is not allowed to occupy multiple houses in violation of regulations. It is not allowed to use public funds to purchase or build houses that exceed the standards. 4. During the period of non-policy losses and wage arrears for employees and teachers in enterprises, it is not allowed to purchase cars. It is not allowed to purchase imported luxury cars such as Benz, Lincoln, Cadillac, and Duke. In April, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection also formulated and implemented handling opinions on clean and self-disciplined leadership. The provisions include: not allowed to build private houses in violation of regulations; not allowed to participate in fundraising for house construction in violation of regulations; not allowed to use military police license plates and foreign license plates; not allowed to use public funds and company vehicles to learn driving techniques without approval; not allowed to participate in entertainment activities such as business singing and dancing halls and nightclubs paid with public funds; not allowed to accept invitations in domestic interactions with units and individuals that may affect the impartial performance of official duties.
The above-mentioned provisions and opinions have put forward clear requirements for clean and self-disciplined leadership, which have made the anti-corruption work basically follow a set of regulations. Based on this, in January 1996, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China put forward again the three working patterns of clean and self-disciplined leadership, investigating and dealing with illegal and disciplinary cases, and correcting the misconduct in departments and industries. The conference also specially emphasized that provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres must abide by the regulations on clean and self-disciplined leadership, abide by party discipline and national laws, be the first to do what is required of subordinates, and firmly refrain from doing what is prohibited. The conference proposed the establishment of a responsibility system for the fight against corruption. For serious corruption issues occurring in the local area, departments, families, and relatives, the responsibilities of the leaders should be investigated. 
In order to ensure that the regulations regarding the clean and disciplined behavior of relevant leadership cadres are effectively implemented, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has also taken a series of concrete measures. First, senior cadres are dispatched to local areas and departments to conduct inspections, responsible for understanding the implementation of the Party's lines, policies, and principles by provincial and ministerial-level leadership teams and their members, as well as the situation of clean governance. They directly report to the CCDI and promptly report to the Party Central Committee. Secondly, it is stipulated that the local disciplinary commission of the Party and the department have the power to conduct preliminary verification if they discover violations of Party discipline by the same level Party committee or its members, and they can directly report to the higher-level discipline inspection commission. No organization or individual has the right to interfere or obstruct such actions. Thirdly, the local disciplinary commission of the Party and the department are required to report to the higher-level discipline inspection commission at the same time as reporting to the same level Party committee when they receive reports and accusations against members of the same level Party committee. No one has the right to withhold such reports.
While continuously improving the various regulations mentioned above, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council have further improved relevant institutions and mechanisms. In terms of institutional construction, after the 16th National Congress of the CPC, the CPC Central Committee with Hu Jintao as the General Secretary attached great importance to the construction and innovation of the anti-corruption system, focusing on preventing and solving corruption issues from the source. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the CPC first proposed the establishment and improvement of a punitive and preventive corruption system that is compatible with the socialist market economy system, giving equal emphasis to education, supervision, and institutions. Subsequently, the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee put forward the sixteen-character guideline for party building, clean governance, and anti-corruption in the new situation, namely "address both symptoms and root causes, comprehensively regulate, punish and prevent, and emphasize prevention", and called for the establishment of an education, institution, and supervision-based punitive and preventive corruption system. In December 2004, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee deliberated and approved the "Outline for the Establishment of a Sound Punitive and Preventive Corruption System with Equal Emphasis on Education, Institution, and Supervision". It clarifies the guiding ideology, main objectives, and working principles for the establishment of a punitive and preventive corruption system. The main objective is to establish the basic framework of the punitive and preventive corruption system by 2010. After further efforts, the system of punishment and prevention of corruption, with long-term mechanisms for moral and ideological education, an institutional system for anti-corruption, and a monitoring mechanism for the exercise of power, should be completed. The working principles are as follows: (1) adhere to and improve the socialist market economy system, develop socialist democratic politics, construct an advanced socialist culture, and build a harmonious socialist society; (2) give equal emphasis to education, institution, and supervision; (3) unite scientificity, systematicness, and feasibility; (4) combine inheritance with innovation. The "Outline" is a guiding document for the current and future periods for carrying out party conduct and clean governance and anti-corruption work. In January 2005, the CPC Central Committee distributed the "Outline" nationwide, requiring all levels of Party committees and governments to effectively implement various anti-corruption tasks.
In the process of promoting the construction of the anti-corruption system, the Party and the state have also successively promulgated a series of laws and regulations to continuously enrich and improve the content of the anti-corruption system. In December 2003, the CPC Central Committee issued the "Regulations on Discipline Inspection within the Communist Party of China (Trial)". For the first time, it comprehensively regulated the key points, approaches, and methods of internal Party supervision in the form of Party regulations, explicitly pointing out that the key targets of internal Party supervision are leadership organs and cadres at all levels, especially the main leaders of leadership teams at all levels. In December 2003, the CPC Central Committee issued the revised "Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China", which made specific and clear provisions on the handling of various disciplinary violations by Party members in the new situation. In accordance with the goal of establishing a power operation mechanism with a reasonable structure, scientific configuration, strict procedures, and effective constraints, the Communist Party of China combines the institutional construction of strengthening power constraints with effective supervision of cadres. In September 2004, the Central Committee promulgated and implemented the "Regulations on the Protection of Rights of Communist Party Members." The General Office of the Central Committee has also issued regulations such as the "Interim Measures for the Supervision and Inspection of the Selection and Appointment of Party and Government Leading Cadres" and the "Interim Provisions on the Open Selection of Party and Government Leading Cadres." In July 2005, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection discussed and adopted the "Provisions on the Assistance of the Discipline Inspection Commission in Organizing and Coordinating Anti-Corruption Work (Trial)." In April 2007, the State Council issued the "Regulations on Administrative Discipline of Government Civil Servants." In addition, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has also formulated a series of supporting regulations in collaboration with relevant departments, such as the "Interim Provisions on the Inspection Work of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and the "Opinions on the Fulfillment of Supervision Duties by the Discipline Inspection Group Sent by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC." The promulgation of these laws and regulations has initially formed a party supervision system with the Party Constitution as the core, the supervision regulations as the backbone, and a series of supporting regulations as important supplements.
The establishment and improvement of a sound system for punishing and preventing corruption is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee based on summarizing historical experience and scientifically judging the situation. It is also a further deepening of the Party's understanding of the governing law and the law of anti-corruption and upholding integrity. The establishment and gradual improvement of this system, in conjunction with the maintenance of activities to enhance the advanced nature of Communist Party members, effectively strengthens the Party's governance capacity and advanced construction, and enhances the Party's ability to resist corruption and risks in the development of the socialist market economy conditions.
IV. The formation and establishment of the important thought of the "Three Represents" and its guiding position
Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Party Central Collective Leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core, has upheld the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, accurately grasped the characteristics of the times, scientifically judged the historical position of our Party, centered around the theme of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, concentrated the wisdom of the whole Party, and carried out theoretical innovation with great courage in Marxism. The important thought of the "Three Represents" was put forward. After further enrichment and development, the important thought of the "Three Represents" was formally established as the guiding ideology of the Party at the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2002.
1. The formation of the important thought of the "Three Represents"
Through continuous summarization of the Party's historical experience and the practical experience since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Party Central Leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core has increasingly deepened its understanding of what socialism is, how to build socialism, what kind of Party to build, and how to build the Party. This laid a foundation for clarifying the important thought of the "Three Represents." On this basis, on February 20, 2000, Jiang Zemin put forward the requirement of the "Five Always" at the education conference on the "Three Emphases" for leading cadres in Gaozhoushi, Maoming, Guangdong Province. The "Five Always" means "We must ensure that the Party always maintains the character of the vanguard of the working class, always represents the interests of the broadest masses of the people, always represents the development demands of the advanced productive forces, always leads the people of all ethnic groups in promoting the development of social productive forces, and always plays a strong and core leadership role, and we must further build the Party ideologically, organizationally and in style in accordance with the new historical conditions." After attending the conference in Gaozhou, Jiang Zemin conducted inspections in Shenzhen, Shunde, and Guangzhou from February 21 to 25. On the 24th, he presided over a symposium on party building work in Guangzhou, where he further put forward the complete thought of the "Three Represents." At the meeting, Jiang Zemin said, "By summing up the history of our Party for more than 70 years, an important conclusion can be drawn. That is, the reason why our Party has won the support of the people is that in various historical periods of revolution, construction, and reform, our Party has always represented the development requirements of China's advanced social productive forces, represented the advancement direction of China's advanced culture, represented the fundamental interests of China's vast majority of people, and through the formulation of correct lines, principles, and policies, has unremittingly struggled for the fundamental interests of the country and the people..." "In the new historical conditions, all Communist Party members and leading cadres must deeply understand and firmly grasp the 'Three Represents' in order to guide their own thoughts and actions. Only by doing so can they truly become qualified party members and qualified party leaders." This is Jiang Zemin's creative answer to the important question of what kind of party to build and how to build the party, based on the new changes in the international and domestic situation at the turn of the century, following the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee and the 15th National Congress. This answer made the overall goal and task of party building more clear, and the direction of party building more distinct.
The introduction of the important thoughts of the "Three Represents" has caused strong reactions both inside and outside the party and at home and abroad. The whole Party and the whole country have enthusiastically carried out studies and research, continuously deepening their understanding of these important thoughts. Based on this, Jiang Zemin also successively expounded on strengthening and improving party leadership under the new situation from different angles at the economic work conference, united front work conference, and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection conference held by the central authorities, enriching and improving the important thoughts of the "Three Represents".
After the introduction of the important thoughts of the "Three Represents", the central leadership focused on two aspects of work to implement these important thoughts:
Firstly, conducting learning and education activities on the important thoughts of the "Three Represents". On November 30, 2000, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee formulated the "Opinions on Carrying out Learning and Education Activities on the Important Thoughts of the 'Three Represents' in Rural Areas," which required the leadership teams and grassroots cadres at the county (city) departments, townships, and villages nationwide to carry out planned and step-by-step learning and education activities on the important thoughts of the "Three Represents" for about two years starting from the winter of 2000 and the spring of 2001. Party committees and governments at all levels quickly formulated implementation plans. Many provinces, municipalities, and counties also implemented a system of responsibilities, established contact points, conducted in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level, and provided on-the-ground guidance. Through the implementation of these activities, the ideological and working styles of grassroots cadres in rural areas have clearly improved, further promoting the development of the rural economy and the improvement of farmers' lives, and achieving the effect of "cadres receiving education, and farmers benefiting".
Secondly, taking party building as a key topic, and conducting extensive thematic research. The central departments formed research groups to conduct investigations and research, listen to opinions extensively, and understand the situation in various aspects. In addition to this, various regions and many departments have also carried out research in various forms, providing valuable materials for thinking about and solving party building problems under the new situation. Party comrades have gained some achievements and consensus through research and discussions, but they also deeply feel that there are still many problems that need to be studied and resolved. In this regard, Jiang Zemin proposed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee held in October 2000: "To enable all Party comrades to deeply understand and comprehensively and correctly grasp the requirements of the 'Three Represents', there is still a lot of work to be done. First, we need to further study the combination of theory and practice in order to form a consensus and provide answers." In January 2001, Jiang Zemin emphasized in his speech at the National Propaganda Department Ministers' Meeting that, when commemorating the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China, it is necessary to "deeply carry out the propaganda and education of the 'Three Represents' throughout the Party" and "make efforts to study, promote, and implement the requirements of the 'Three Represents' well".
On July 1, 2001, the CPC Central Committee held a grand ceremony to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China in Beijing. Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech at the meeting, systematically expounding on the scientific connotation of the important thoughts of the "Three Represents". Jiang Zemin pointed out: Our party must always represent the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces. This means that the party's theories, guidelines, principles, policies, and all work must strive to conform to the laws of productive force development, embody the requirements of continuously promoting the liberation and development of social productive forces, especially the requirements to promote the development of advanced productive forces and continuously improve the living standards of the people. Our party must always represent the progressive direction of China's advanced culture. This means that the party's theories, guidelines, principles, policies, and all work must strive to reflect the requirements of developing a modern, globalized, and future-oriented socialist culture that is national, scientific, and popular. It must also promote the continuous improvement of the ideological and moral qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the entire nation, providing spiritual and intellectual support for the development of our economy and social progress. Our party must always represent the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people. This means that the party's theories, guidelines, principles, policies, and all work must adhere to the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal, fully give play to the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the masses, and ensure that the people continuously obtain tangible economic, political, and cultural benefits on the basis of continuous social development and progress.
In the "July 1st Speech," Jiang Zemin not only comprehensively expounded the scientific connotation and basic content of the important thought of the "Three Represents," but also clearly pointed out how to implement it. After the "July 1st Speech" was delivered, the central government and various regions held a series of theoretical seminars to study the spirit of Jiang Zemin's "July 1st Speech." The Central Propaganda Department formed an important speech promotion group consisting of relevant department leaders and theoretical workers to spread the spirit of the "July 1st Speech" to central government bodies and across the country, achieving good results. The Central Organization Department established a research group composed of relevant departments to continue carrying out a series of special surveys on the issue of party construction in the new situation. A nationwide wave of learning and practicing the "Three Represents" has formed.
With the deepening of the study and practice activities of the "Three Represents," people have gained a deeper understanding of how to build the party in accordance with the requirements of the "Three Represents."
On May 31, 2002, Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech at the graduation ceremony of the Central Party School for provincial and ministerial-level cadre training classes. He further elaborated on the guiding significance and essence of the important thought of the "Three Represents" in light of the situation, tasks, and work principles that the party faces in the new century and new stage. He pointed out that to create a new situation in the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and comprehensively implement the requirements of the "Three Represents." The "Three Represents" is in line with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and reflects the new requirements of the development and changes in the contemporary world and China for the work of the party and the state. The "Three Represents" is the foundation, the governing principles, and the source of strength for our party. It is a powerful theoretical weapon for strengthening and improving the party's construction and promoting the self-improvement and development of our country's socialist system.
He emphasized that the key to implementing the requirements of the "Three Represents" lies in advancing with the times, the core lies in maintaining the party's advanced nature, and the essence lies in governing for the people. All party members must firmly grasp this fundamental requirement and constantly enhance their consciousness and determination to implement the requirements of the "Three Represents." At the same time, he also elaborated on the importance of adhering to the party's ideological line and promoting theoretical innovation, emphasizing the need to uphold the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and promote the spirit of advancing with the times. This is the decisive factor for the party to maintain its advanced nature and creativity under the conditions of long-term governance. Whether our party can always achieve this will determine the future and destiny of China.
This speech further unified the thinking of the whole party and made sufficient preparations for the convening of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the establishment of the guiding status of the important thought of the "Three Represents" throughout the party.
From November 8th to 14th, 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. This congress formally established the "Three Represents" important thought as the guiding ideology of the Party. The Congress report, after summarizing the precious experience accumulated by our party in the past thirteen years, clearly pointed out: "These experiences, summed up in the historical experience since the establishment of the party, can be summarized as follows: our party must always represent the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces, represent the advancement direction of China's advanced culture, and represent the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people."
The important thought of the "Three Represents" was proposed on the basis of scientifically judging the historical position of the Party. To implement the important thought of the "Three Represents," the entire Party must always maintain a spirit of keeping pace with the times, continuously explore new frontiers in the development of Marxist theory, treat development as the Party's top priority in governing the country, constantly create new situations in modernization construction, mobilize all positive factors the most extensively and fully, continuously add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and advance party building with a spirit of reform, continuously injecting new vitality into the Party's organization. In short, the important thought of the "Three Represents" is about development and progress. The entire Party must constantly liberate their thinking, continuously develop new theories, and continuously create new practices, implement the important thought of the "Three Represents" in various areas of socialist modernization construction, and reflect it in various aspects of Party building, so that our Party always moves in sync with the development of the times and shares a common destiny with the people.
The report comprehensively and concisely explains the epochal background, historical status, scientific connotation, spiritual essence, and guiding significance of the important thought of the "Three Represents" through a series of expositions. In general, the important thought of the "Three Represents" is to continue exploring by creatively applying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, especially Deng Xiaoping Theory, closely integrating with the new situation of the times, the new requirements of the vast Chinese people, and the new practices of China's reform, opening up, and modernization, for answering the questions of what socialism is and how to build socialism. It includes adhering to and improving the basic economic system of socialist public ownership as the mainstay and the common development of multiple ownership economies; adhering to and improving the distribution system dominated by the principle of distribution according to work and the coexistence of multiple distribution methods; establishing a socialist market economic system; promoting strategic adjustments to the economic structure and transforming the growth mode; advancing the development of the western region and promoting coordinated regional development; implementing a combination of "bringing in" and "going global" strategies; developing socialist democracy; constructing a socialist rule of law state; developing socialist advanced culture; promoting the coordinated development of material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization in socialism; promoting multipolarity in the world and democratization of international relations; and correctly dealing with and mastering economic globalization, promoting common development, etc. These are a series of innovative theoretical achievements. On the question of building the Party and what kind of Party to build, it adheres to examining itself from the perspective of the requirements of the development of the times, strengthens and improves itself with the spirit of reform, effectively addresses the two major historical tasks of improving the Party's leadership level and governance capacity, and comprehensively promotes a new great project of Party building, forming a new understanding of Party building.
It is precisely because the important thought of the "Three Represents" has formed a set of new theoretical achievements that the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China established the important thought of the "Three Represents" as the guiding ideology of the Party alongside Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Establishing the important thought of the "Three Represents" as the guiding ideology of the Party is a historic decision of this congress and also a historic contribution. On the basis of a series of discussions at the 16th National Congress, the Party Constitution Amendment adopted at the conference incorporated the important thought of the "Three Represents" into the Party Constitution, along with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, as the action guide for the Communist Party of China. It clearly stipulates that the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, as well as the vanguard of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. It is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, representing the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces, the progressive direction of China's advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the broadest people. The Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of the "Three Represents" as its action guide, which is the guiding ideology that the Party must adhere to for a long time. Just as the 7th National Congress of the Party established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the Party, and the 15th National Congress of the Party established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the Party, which played an extremely important role in the victorious development of China's revolution and construction, the 16th National Congress established the important thought of the "Three Represents" as the guiding ideology of the Party, which will also play an extremely important role in creating a new situation in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
After the important thought of the "Three Represents" was incorporated into the Party Constitution at the 16th National Congress, on March 14, 2004, the 2nd Session of the 10th National People's Congress passed the Amendment to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, incorporating the important thought of the "Three Represents" into the Constitution, establishing its guiding position in our country's political and social life. This is of great significance to our Party and country. In the new century and new stage, the Communist Party of China is to hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of the "Three Represents", adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and lead the people in striving for the comprehensive construction of a well-off society and the basic realization of modernization.
2. The significant historical significance of the establishment of the important thought of the "Three Represents" as the guiding ideology of the Party
The establishment of the important thought of the "Three Represents" as the guiding ideology of the Party has significant historical significance in the development history of Marxism, especially the development history of scientific socialism.
Firstly, it has pushed Marxism to a new height in the new era and theoretical level. The important thought of the "Three Represents" is the product of China's reform and opening-up and the practice of socialist modernization. This important thought stands at the height of China's development and the world's development. Based on the inheritance of the understanding of Marxism, it further answers the questions of "what is socialism, and how to build socialism" and creatively answers the questions of "what kind of party to build and how to build it", greatly enriching the theoretical treasury of Marxism and opening up a new realm for the development of Marxist theory. The formation of the important thought of the "Three Represents" and its establishment as the guiding ideology of the whole Party, especially its important guiding role in practice in our country's economic and social development, indicates that the Communist Party of China has reached a new theoretical height in understanding the laws of Party governance, socialist construction, and the development of human society.
Secondly, it has endowed Marxism with a new era connotation. The important thought of the "Three Represents" is the inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory. This important thought, starting from the new reality of China and the world, through continuous summary of practical experience and theoretical summarization of the spirit of the times and practical requirements, creatively combines the construction of the Party with the development and changes of today's world and the development trend of contemporary China, the self-improvement and development of the socialist system of our country, and the grand goal and various tasks of realizing socialism with Chinese characteristics, endowing the nature of the Party, its purposes, guiding ideology, and historical tasks with distinct era connotation and characteristics. Therefore, this important thought reflects the new requirements of the developments and changes in the world and China for the work of the Party and the country. It is the latest achievement of the development of Marxism in China, a powerful theoretical weapon to strengthen and improve the construction of the Party, and to promote the self-improvement and development of Chinese socialism. It is the guiding ideology that the Party must adhere to for a long time and the foundation, basis, and source of the establishment, governance, and strength of our Party.
Thirdly, it creatively inherits and develops the basic principles of Marxism. The important thoughts of the "Three Represents" in understanding the party's governing laws, socialist construction laws, and the laws of human social development have creatively developed the basic Marxist theory that the progress of human society is ultimately determined by productivity, guided by advanced culture, and driven by the masses. It reveals that socialism with Chinese characteristics is the organic unity of a socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, and socialist advanced culture. It is a comprehensive development of socialist material civilization, spiritual civilization, and political civilization. It profoundly expounds the socialist modernization undertakings led by the Communist Party of China, the development and progress of Chinese society, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the inherent connection with the Party's new great construction project. These main viewpoints have creatively developed the basic theory of Marxism on the basis of inheriting the existing understanding of Marxism.
In summary, the important thoughts of the "Three Represents" closely integrate with the new era conditions and, with great theoretical courage and scientific spirit of exploration, adhere to and develop Marxism, giving Marxism new vitality. It once again firmly demonstrates that the basic principles of Marxism are still the sharp ideological weapon for us to correctly understand and transform the world and continuously promote social practice.
Chapter 11: The proposal of comprehensively building a well-off society and the scientific outlook on development
Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory and the important thoughts of the "Three Represents", China's economic and social development and various aspects of work have made great strides. By the end of the 20th century, China had initially established a new socialist market system and the overall living standards of the people had reached a well-off level. Based on this, the Party Central Committee further put forward the new goal of comprehensively building a well-off society in light of the domestic and international situation and the basic conditions of China's economic and social development. In order to better guide the comprehensive construction of a well-off society and smoothly promote China's economic and social development, the Communist Party of China timely proposed the scientific outlook on development after the turn of the century. With the goal of building a well-off society comprehensively and the guidance of the scientific outlook on development, China's society has embarked on a new historical journey of socialist modernization.
I. The new goal of comprehensively building a well-off society and the improvement of the reform program for the market economy
Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992, in accordance with the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, the Communist Party of China has continuously increased efforts to remove old practices and introduce new ones, making significant breakthroughs in many areas and promoting the fundamental transformation from a traditional planned economy system to a socialist market economy system. By 2000, the socialist market economic system had been initially established, and the overall living standards of the people had reached a well-off level.
1. The initial establishment of the socialist market economic system and the overall achievement of well-off living standards
The initial establishment of the socialist market economic system is mainly manifested in the following aspects: the ownership structure is increasingly diversified, and the micro-vitality of the national economy is enhanced; the market system has basically taken shape, and the production factor market has begun to take shape; active exploration of a new macroeconomic regulation system, with indirect regulation methods beginning to play a major role; reform in the field of income distribution has gradually deepened; the construction of the social security system has steadily advanced; the pace of reform in government institutions and the transformation of functions has accelerated; the deepening of reform has significantly increased the degree of marketization of the national economy, and the fundamental role of market allocation of resources has gradually strengthened. By the end of 2000, China had initially established a socialist market economic system and became a developing market economy country. This is a fundamental change in China's economic system over the past twenty years of reform and opening up, especially since the 14th National Congress. This fundamental change not only greatly changes the institutional environment for China's economic development but also has a profound influence on the social life and ideological concepts of the Chinese people. This is of decisive importance to China's reform and construction as well as the theoretical development and innovation of the Party.
While making the judgment that our country has basically established a socialist market economic system, our Party also made another judgment from a macro perspective: our country has overall achieved a "moderately prosperous society" and based on this, made new plans for the future development goals of the new century.
The concept of "xiaokang" has undergone a historical process in the application of China's society in the new era. As early as 1979, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of "xiaokang" and envisioned achieving the goal of "xiaokang" by the end of the 20th century. Since then, the concept of "xiaokang" has been interpreted and enriched from different perspectives.
In December 1990, the "Suggestions on Formulating the Ten-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Eighth Five-Year Plan" passed by the 7th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that "people's lives should go from having enough food and clothing to reaching a moderately prosperous level, with more abundant material resources, a more reasonable consumption structure, significantly improved living conditions, further enriched cultural life, continued improvement in health levels, and continuously improved social service facilities." These mainly focus on the quality of life. In 1991, the National Bureau of Statistics and 12 other departments proposed 16 indicators for the level of xiaokang, including per capita GDP, Engel's coefficient, per capita disposable income of urban residents, and per capita net income of rural residents. According to this standard, China's overall living standard reached a moderately prosperous level by 2000.
In the "Suggestions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Formulating the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Goals for 2010" passed at the 5th Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee in 1995, the deadline for achieving "xiaokang" was set at 2000, and by then, China planned to "basically eliminate poverty and make people's lives reach a moderately prosperous level." Generally speaking, the definition of xiaokang life is similar to the international concept of quality of life, including material living conditions such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation; living environment including air quality, transportation, water quality, green areas, etc.; and social environment such as social order, sense of security, social moral norms, etc.
After years of development through reform and opening up, China generally reached the level of "xiaokang" and achieved the strategic goal of the second step of socialist modernization construction by 2000. In this context, the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2000 clearly announced that China had achieved overall "xiaokang" and would "enter the new development stage of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society and accelerating the socialist modernization." It marked a new milestone in the development history of the Chinese nation. Based on the recommendations of the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee, the State Council formulated the "Outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development" which was approved at the 4th Session of the 9th National People's Congress in March 2001. This outline provided a blueprint for economic and social development in the first five years after entering the new century, clarified guiding principles and major tasks, and became the action plan for people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive for in the early years of the new century. With the implementation of the "10th Five-Year Plan," China entered a new stage of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society and accelerating socialist modernization construction.
By the end of the 20th century, people's lives generally reached a moderately prosperous level, which marked a new milestone in the development history of the Chinese nation. It also laid a solid foundation for further development in the new century.
2. The formulation of the goal of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society at the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
Shortly after entering the new century, the Communist Party of China held its 16th National Congress from November 8th to 14th, 2002 in Beijing. The conference passed the report entitled "Building a Well-off Society in an All-round Way and Creating a New Era for the Cause of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" presented by Jiang Zemin on behalf of the 15th Central Committee. It also passed the amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the work report of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. A new Central Committee and a new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, consisting of 198 central committee members and 158 alternate committee members, were elected.
The theme of this conference is to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, fully implement the important thought of "Three Represents," carry forward the past and forge ahead into the future, advance with the times, comprehensively build a well-off society, accelerate the socialist modernization, and strive to create a new era for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The entire content of the report of the 16th National Congress revolves around this theme, clearly demonstrating to the world that the banner held high by the CPC in the new stage of the new century is the banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the banner of the important thought of "Three Represents." The path the CPC must take is the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Deng Xiaoping, adhered to and developed by the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core. The goals that the CPC, leading the Chinese people, must achieve in the first 50 years of the new century are to comprehensively build a well-off society and then achieve modernization. These vivid and powerful answers demonstrate the determination of the Party Central Committee, reflect the aspiration of the people, embody the objective requirements for the continuous development of the Party and the cause of the country, and are of great significance for unifying the thinking of the whole Party and the whole nation, consolidating strength, forging ahead with unity and determination, arduously leading the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era.
The report comprehensively reviews the 13-year struggle and the basic experience since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee in 1989, especially since the 15th National Congress. The report points out that it is widely recognized that these 13 years have been a period in which our country's overall national strength has greatly increased, and the people have benefited the most. It has been a period in which our society has maintained stability, unity, and harmony for a long time, and our international influence has significantly expanded and the cohesion of the nation has greatly enhanced. The practice over the past 13 years has deepened our understanding of what socialism is, how to build socialism, what kind of party to build, and how to build the party, accumulating valuable experience. They are as follows: (1) adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide and constantly promote theoretical innovation; (2) prioritize economic construction and solve problems through development methods; (3) adhere to reform and opening up, continuously improve the socialist market economy; (4) adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and develop socialist democratic politics; (5) pay equal attention to material and spiritual civilization, combine ruling the country by law with ruling the country with virtue; (6) adhere to the principle that stability overrides everything else, and correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability; (7) adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the military and take the road of building a powerful army with Chinese characteristics; (8) unite all forces that can be united and continuously enhance the cohesion of the Chinese nation; (9) adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace and promote world peace and common development; (10) strengthen and improve the leadership of the Party, and comprehensively promote the new great project of party building. These ten points are the basic experience that leaders of the Party must adhere to in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. These experiences, combined with the historical experience since the Party's founding, boil down to the fact that our party must always represent the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces, the direction of China's advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people. This is an inevitable requirement for adhering to and developing socialism and the inevitable conclusion drawn from our party's arduous exploration and great practice.
Based on the requirements of creating a new era for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 16th National Congress of the Party, on the basis of a profound analysis of the new situation and new tasks faced by the Party and the country, has determined the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way.
On November 8th, Jiang Zemin stated in the report of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that based on the development goals proposed at the 15th National Congress of the Party, which aimed to achieve a higher level of well-off society benefiting over 1 billion people by 2010, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Party, and the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, "we must concentrate our efforts in the first two decades of this century to comprehensively build a well-off society that benefits over one billion people, making the economy more developed, democracy more sound, science and education more advanced, culture more prosperous, society more harmonious, and people's lives more prosperous. This is a stage of development that must be passed through to achieve the strategic goal of modernization construction, as well as a crucial stage for improving the socialist market economy and expanding opening up to the outside world. After completing this stage of construction, we will continue to strive for several decades to basically achieve modernization by the middle of this century and build our country into a socialist state that is prosperous, strong, democratic, and culturally advanced."
By 2020, China's future will present the following bright prospects:
(1) On the basis of optimizing the structure and improving efficiency, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country will strive to double that of 2000 by 2020, and its comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness will significantly enhance. Basic industrialization will be achieved, and a sound socialist market economy and a more dynamic and open economic system will be established. The proportion of urban population will increase significantly, and the trend of widening gaps between urban and rural areas, as well as between different regions, will gradually reverse. The social security system will be comparatively sound, social employment will be relatively sufficient, family property will generally increase, and the people will live a more affluent life.
(2) Socialist democracy will be further improved, the socialist legal system will be more comprehensive, the basic strategy of ruling the country according to law will be fully implemented, and people's political, economic, and cultural rights and interests will be genuinely respected and safeguarded. Grassroots democracy will be better developed, social order will be good, and people will live and work in peace and contentment.
(3) The overall quality of the entire nation in terms of ideology, morality, science and culture, and health will significantly improve, and a comparatively complete modern national education system, scientific and cultural innovation system, and national fitness and medical healthcare system will be formed. The people will have the opportunity to receive good education, and high school education will be universally accessible, eliminating illiteracy. A learning society for all and lifelong learning will be formed to promote the all-round development of individuals.
(4) The capacity for sustainable development will continuously enhance, the ecological environment will be improved, resource utilization efficiency will significantly increase, promoting harmony between humans and nature, and propelling the whole society towards a path of civilized development with productive development, abundant living conditions, and a good ecological environment.
The goal of comprehensively building a well-off society as determined by the 16th National Congress of the Party is more enriched and profound in its connotations compared to the past, even though it only adds the two words "comprehensive" in its expression. "Comprehensively building a well-off society" refers to the relatively low level, incompleteness, and imbalanced development of the well-off state achieved in China by the end of the 20th century. Therefore, the comprehensive construction of a well-off society can be summarized as three "mores": "higher level," "more comprehensive coverage," and "more coordinated development."
The goal of comprehensively building a well-off society as set by the 16th National Congress is the goal of comprehensive development of China's socialist economy, politics, culture, and society, further enriching and developing the strategic plan for China's socialist modernization in three steps.
First, the comprehensive construction of a well-off society has raised the concept of social development in our country to a new height. Development is the first priority of the Communist Party of China's governance and national rejuvenation. From meeting basic needs to achieving moderate prosperity, this represents a transformative progress in development led by the Party. However, even after achieving this transformative development, China still faces numerous contradictions and problems that need to be further addressed. For example, productivity and technology, as well as education, are relatively lagging behind. We still face pressure from developed countries that have advantages in areas such as economy and technology. Our economic system and other management systems are not yet perfect, and the rural-urban dual economic structure has not changed. The trend of widening regional disparities has not been fundamentally reversed. There are still people who need to be lifted out of poverty, the total population continues to increase, the proportion of elderly population is rising, and there is increasing pressure on employment and social security. Contradictions between natural resources, ecological environment, and economic and social development are becoming increasingly prominent. There are also some significant issues in cultural construction, democratic and legal construction, and ethical and moral construction that cannot be ignored, and so on. All of these require us to consider and resolve comprehensively. The introduction of the ideology and goals of building a well-off society in all respects demonstrates that the senior decision-makers of the Communist Party of China have a full understanding of this. This has brought the socialist modernization construction of our country, which encompasses comprehensive development in the economic, political, cultural, and social fields, to a new level of understanding.
Second, the comprehensive construction of a well-off society expands the perspective of consolidating and developing socialism from the perspective of productivity to the perspective of people's livelihood. In the report of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, when summarizing the basic experience of the past thirteen years, it clearly stated that "problems in the course of progress should be solved through development". Regarding how to solve the problem of development, Marxist classical authors have long pointed out insightfully that the reason why socialism is superior to capitalism is that it can create higher social productivity than capitalism. This conclusion is unquestionable. However, from the historical experiences, both positive and negative, at home and abroad since the 1990s, people's high or low identification with a country, a political party, or a society is manifested not only in social productivity but also in whether the living standards and quality of life of the people can continue to improve, whether the social environment and cultural atmosphere can be continuously optimized. The introduction and formulation of the ideology and goals of building a well-off society in all respects are precisely in this regard, reflecting a new understanding and development of Marxism's thinking on the liberation and development of social productivity.
Third, the comprehensive construction of a well-off society embodies the practical requirements of the important thought of the "Three Represents." The essence of the comprehensive construction of a well-off society is to continuously liberate and develop social productivity, continuously build advanced socialist culture, continuously improve people's living standards and quality, and realize the comprehensive development of politics, economy, culture, and society. Implementing the important thought of the "Three Represents," its first priority is also development, which reflects the development that embodies advanced productivity, advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the broadest people. From the perspective of the essential requirements for promoting social development, the implementation of the important thought of the "Three Represents" and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society have historical and logical unity.
Fourth, the comprehensive construction of a well-off society is an action plan that fully embodies the spirit of the times in the new century. Formulating a goal and action plan that conforms to the requirements of the times and reflects the wishes of the people is the key to whether a political party can unite and mobilize all positive factors to strive together for a common goal. From a historical perspective, in different historical periods, the Party has proposed inspiring goals based on the development changes of the times and the needs of social development, rallying the vast masses of the people around itself, thus continuously transforming from one victory to another in revolution, construction, and reform. The goal of building a well-off society in all respects proposed by the 16th National Congress of the Party is undoubtedly a goal that is in line with the national conditions, conforms to the times, represents the fundamental interests of the people, and embodies the needs of the times. It is a realistic, pragmatic, innovative, and action-oriented action plan for advancing the socialist modernization of our country in the new century.
3. Further improve the outline of the reform of the socialist market economy
The development of the socialist market economy is a significant innovation of Chinese Communists in Marxist economic theory. According to the reform direction of the socialist market economy, China has not only gradually transitioned from a planned economy system to a socialist market economy system but also through practical exploration, has gradually enriched and developed the reform outline of the socialist market economy.
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China began to implement reform and opening-up. After more than ten years of practical exploration and theoretical summarization, the relationship between planning and the market gradually became clear, thereby laying the foundation for establishing the reform goal of the socialist market economy system. In 1992, the Fourteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China established the reform goal of the socialist market economy system. In 1993, the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy System, which was adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee of the Party, initially formulated the overall plan for the reform of China's socialist market economy system and outlined its basic content and framework, providing a guiding principle for China's economic system reform in the 1990s. Subsequently, the Fifteenth and Sixteenth National Congresses, based on the summary of practical experience, gradually deepened the Party's understanding of the socialist market economy and preliminary established the socialist market economy system, which made significant progress in China's economic system reform.
First, a pattern of the dominant public ownership with diverse forms of ownership developing together has basically formed. Through years of adjustment and improvement to the ownership structure, China's ownership structure has gradually become more rational. The forms of public ownership have diversified from being singular to becoming diverse, and the layout of the entire state-owned economy has become more reasonable. By the year 2000, the majority of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises had initially established a modern enterprise system. The collective economy in urban and rural areas has added new vitality through reform and reorganization. Some enterprises with a solid foundation have achieved new developments by introducing market mechanisms. Non-public ownership economies, such as individual, private, joint venture, and foreign-funded enterprises, have shown vigorous vitality from weak to strong. The shareholding system and mixed ownership economy have become increasingly important types of economic entities encouraged by the national policies. In line with the reform towards a market orientation and the adjustment of the ownership structure, the distribution system with the remuneration based on labor has been continuously improved, and multiple modes of distribution coexist. Incentive mechanisms have gradually been strengthened, and a situation where factors of production such as labor, capital, technology, and management participate in distribution based on contribution has been formed.
Second, the socialist market economy system has been initially established. With the establishment of the basic economic system and the continuous development of various market elements, the micro foundation of the socialist market economy system has gradually formed. With the further development of the commodity market, the pace of development of factor markets, such as capital, labor, technology, real estate, has also accelerated, and the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation has been increasingly enhanced. While promoting market-oriented reform, the reform of the national macroeconomic management system has also been comprehensively promoted. The state's ability to macroscopically regulate the economy has been continuously enhanced. Through the coordination of state planning, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and various regulatory means, the policy system of macroeconomic regulation has been gradually improved.
Third, China's economic and social development level has been greatly improved. China has transitioned from the early stage of industrialization to the middle stage. The mode of economic growth has gradually shifted from extensive to intensive, and the economic quality has improved significantly along with the expansion of the overall economy. The total economic output and total import and export trade of our country has entered the forefront of the world. The people's lives have achieved two historic leaps. In the 1980s, we basically solved the problem of getting enough to eat and wear, and in the 1990s, we went from having enough to eat and wear to achieving a moderately well-off standard of living. For thousands of years, the problem of eating has plagued the Chinese people, but under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it has been fundamentally solved. The dream of a moderately well-off life that has been passed down from generation to generation has now begun to become a reality. Alongside the rapid economic growth and continuous social progress, achievements of historical significance have been made in education, science, culture, as well as in population, environment, and other social undertakings. They have started on the path of sustainable development and comprehensive social progress. This is a great victory of the socialist system and a new milestone in the development history of the Chinese nation.
Fourth, the social security system has been initially established, and the social security system, with old-age, unemployment, and medical insurance for urban employees as its main components, continues to be improved. The channels for social security funds have become diversified, and management services have become socialized. The basic livelihood security system for laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises, the unemployment insurance system, and the minimum living security system for urban residents have been continuously improved, playing an important role in maintaining social stability.
Through a series of reforms over a considerable period of time, China's economy and society have made remarkable progress under market conditions. However, we should also see that while achieving the aforementioned series of accomplishments, some deep-seated contradictions that have long existed have not been fundamentally resolved. Additionally, new contradictions and problems have accumulated in the economic and social fields. The prominent issues include an irrational economic structure, persistent gaps in urban-rural and regional development, slow growth of farmer's income, an increase in laid-off workers, prominent employment issues, increasing resource and environmental pressures, and weak overall economic competitiveness, among others. The causes of these problems are multifaceted, and one important reason is that our socialist market economy system is not yet perfect and still cannot meet the requirements of developing productive forces, especially advanced productive forces. These two opposing situations have simultaneously placed new demands on deepening the reform of the socialist market economy system.
Reform is a powerful driving force for economic development and social progress. In order to adapt to the international environment of economic globalization and accelerated technological progress, and to adapt to the new situation of building a moderately well-off society in all respects, in October 2003, the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Party passed the Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economic System (referred to as the "Decision"). It emphasized the reform goals and tasks concerning important institutional issues that need to be addressed in the current and future periods, and made decisions and arrangements.
First, the main goals for improving the socialist market economy system. The "Decision" proposes that we should, in accordance with the requirements of coordinating urban-rural development, regional development, economic and social development, harmony between human and nature, and domestic development and opening-up, give full play to the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation to a greater extent, enhance the vitality and competitiveness of enterprises, improve the national macroeconomic regulation system, and improve government social management and public service functions, in order to provide strong institutional guarantee for building a moderately well-off society in all respects.
Second, the main tasks of the reform of the socialist market economy system. The "Decision" clearly states that it is necessary to improve the basic economic system of the dominant public ownership and the simultaneous development of various forms of ownership; establish a system that is conducive to gradually changing the dual economic structure of urban and rural areas; form a mechanism to promote coordinated regional economic development; construct a unified, open, and orderly modern market economy system; improve the macroeconomic regulation system, administrative management system, and economic legal system; improve the employment, income distribution, and social security system; and establish mechanisms to promote sustainable economic and social development.
Third, regarding the guiding ideology and principles for deepening the reform of the socialist market economy system. The "Decision" clearly states that it should be guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of the "Three Represents," implement the Party's basic line, basic program, and basic experience, comprehensively implement the spirit of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and keep pace with the times. It is necessary to adhere to the direction of the reform of the socialist market economy, focus on institutional construction and innovative systems. It is necessary to adhere to the spirit of pioneering by the masses and give full play to the initiative of both the central and local governments. It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability, and promote reform in a targeted and step-by-step manner. It is necessary to take overall considerations, coordinate various interests in the process of reform. It is necessary to put people first, establish a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development concept, and promote comprehensive development of the economy, society, and individuals. From the perspective of the guiding ideology of deepening the reform of the socialist market economy, compared with the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic System" in 1993, it incorporates the latest spirit of the Party's guiding ideology and reflects the progressiveness of the Party's guiding ideology.
The "Decision" reflects the latest understanding of the situation of China's economic and social development in the 21st century by the Party, and has distinct inheritance and continuity. It is a historic document that bridges the past and the future. It systematically enriches the content that was not possible or mature enough to be developed ten years ago, and is a landmark document for the improvement of the socialist market economy in China in the new century. It deepens the guidelines for the reform of the socialist market economy from three major aspects.
First, it further develops Marxist economic theory. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, especially since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, with the gradual establishment and improvement of the socialist market economic system, the reform process has presented some new features: China's reform is no longer like "crossing the river by feeling the stones" in the 1980s, but is carried out under the guidance of the overall reform plan; the topics discussed by the leadership and the theoretical community have also shifted from "whether to reform" to "how to reform". The theory of the socialist market economy has also continuously developed and improved in the deepening of reform practice and theoretical debates.
After the economic operation was shifted to the market system and basic consensus was reached within and outside the Party, the focus of theoretical discussions began to shift to the field of ownership. As a result, the differences of various opinions were manifested in the form of whether the reform should be "oriented towards the public" or "oriented towards the private". The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly answered this question. In terms of the recognition of the status of the non-public economy, based on the basic national conditions of the primary stage of socialism, the report of the 15th National Congress broke through the previous judgment of the non-public economy as an "important supplement" or a "beneficial supplement" to the public ownership economy. It believed that the dominant public ownership and the simultaneous development of various forms of ownership are a "basic economic system" of the primary stage of socialism in China, and it recognized that the non-public economy is an "important component" of the socialist market economy. In terms of understanding the socialist market economy, the report emphasizes that the socialist market economy includes not only state-owned economy and collective economy, but also the state-owned and collective components in the mixed ownership economy. The forms of implementing public ownership should be diversified, and all operating methods and organizational forms that reflect the laws of socialized production can be boldly utilized. Efforts should be made to find forms of public ownership that can greatly promote the development of productive forces. Regarding the understanding of the state-owned economy, the report believes that the leading role of the state-owned economy refers to controlling the lifeline of the national economy, but this is in the context of the entire country. The dominant role of the state-owned economy mainly manifests in terms of control power, and the layout of the state-owned economy should be adjusted strategically. The 15th National Congress placed the theory of socialist market economy under the background of the primary stage of socialism, which clearly answered the question of whether the reform is oriented towards "public" or "private" and fundamentally developed the theory of socialist market economy.
In the late 1990s, China's second-step strategic goal for modernization was basically achieved. At the beginning of the new century, the third-step strategic goal was timely launched. From top to bottom, people discussed the issues of "strategic opportunity period" and "period of prominent contradictions" coexisting. The new central leadership collective formed at the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the scientific concept of development of "putting people first" and "comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development" at the third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, and made the decision on several issues concerning the improvement of the socialist market economic system. In this decision, the Party also made innovations in the theory of socialist market economy, particularly in the theories of ownership and property rights. For the first time, the decision proposed "vigorously developing mixed ownership economy with participation of state-owned capital, collective capital, and non-public capital, achieving diversification of investment subjects, and making joint-stock system the main form of public ownership." Before this, joint-stock system was only considered as one form of implementation. The phrasing in the report of the 16th National Congress was "actively promote the joint-stock system and develop mixed ownership economy." The significant change in the decision will greatly accelerate the diversification of state-owned enterprises and create opportunities for more private enterprises and foreign investors to enter state-owned joint-stock companies. In terms of property rights theory, the decision for the first time proposed that "property rights are the core and main content of ownership, including real rights, creditor's rights, equity rights, and intellectual property rights." The transition from establishing a modern enterprise system to establishing a modern property rights system in enterprise reform indicates that both the theory and practice of China's enterprise reform have entered a new stage.
Secondly, the report deepened and improved the connotation of the socialist market economy reform objectives. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that according to the requirements of coordinating urban-rural development, regional development, economic and social development, harmony between man and nature, domestic development and opening-up, the market should play a fundamental role in resource allocation to a greater extent, enhance the vitality and competitiveness of enterprises, improve the national macroeconomic regulation, and improve government social management and public service functions, providing institutional guarantees for building a well-off society in an all-round way. From the perspective of this statement in the decision, it deepened and improved the connotation of the socialist market economy reform objectives from three aspects. First, it identified the "five coordinations" as the starting point for deepening reform. This is an extremely important reform concept proposed by our Party based on summarizing the historical experience of reform since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, according to the characteristics of the current environment and the future trends of domestic and international changes. It is a distinctive feature of this decision’s proposed reform objectives. Second, it embodies the organic unity of the stage and continuity of China's economic system reform. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, that is, giving full play to the fundamental role of the market under macroeconomic regulation. After 10 years of efforts and bold exploration, the goals of the reform have been basically achieved. Based on this, the "Decision" further adds the basic connotations of expanding the market's fundamental role, improving enterprise vitality and competitiveness, improving the national macroeconomic control system, and strengthening the government's public service functions. It combines with the basic connotations of developing a socialist market economy proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and together they constitute the main connotations of deepening the reform of the socialist market economy system. This not only enriches the connotations of the reform objectives of the socialist market economy system, but also reflects the organic unity of the stage and continuity of China's economic system reform. Third, it integrates content related to institutional guarantees. From the perspective of Marxist principles, society is an open system, with high interdependence between urban and rural areas, regions, and between humans and nature. The economy and society are inseparable, and internal conditions are interconnected with the external environment. Therefore, reforms must analyze problems from multiple perspectives such as the economy and society, urban and rural areas, humans and nature, domestic and international, developed and underdeveloped regions, in order to propose reform objectives and more effectively promote the liberation and development of productive forces.
Third, it makes the historical task of deepening the reform of the socialist market economy more specific and clear. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed seven tasks for further deepening the reform: (1) improving the basic economic system in which public ownership is the mainstay and multiple forms of ownership develop together; (2) establishing a system conducive to gradually changing the dual economic structure of urban and rural areas; (3) forming mechanisms to promote coordinated regional economic development; (4) building a unified, open, competitive, and orderly modern market system; (5) improving the macroeconomic control system, administrative management system, and economic legal system; (6) improving the employment, income distribution, and social security systems; (7) establishing mechanisms to promote sustainable economic and social development. The Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of a socialist market economic system, mainly proposing reform tasks in the construction of a market system for state-owned enterprises, the construction of a macroeconomic control system, and the construction of distribution systems and social security systems. Based on the historical conditions at that time, when determining the reform tasks, the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Central Committee emphasized the integrity of the market system. The tasks proposed in the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee further strengthened the realism and targetedness, making the historical tasks of economic reform more specific and clear. From the current situation, if issues such as the effective form of public ownership, orderly competition in the market, and the transformation of government public functions cannot be resolved, China's economy cannot sustain healthy and rapid development, industries cannot form strong competitiveness, and the favorable situation of opening up to the outside world cannot be sustained; if issues such as urban-rural disparities, regional disparities, and disharmony between humans and nature cannot be gradually solved through institutional and mechanistic guarantees, social stability cannot be maintained, and the grand goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way cannot be achieved. It is precisely because of these real problems that the "Decision" proposes seven clear and specific reform tasks, and its fundamental purpose is to eliminate the institutional barriers to the development of productive forces and provide strong institutional guarantees for building a well-off society in an all-round way.
The above-mentioned historical process fully reflects the development of China's reform practice, reflects the exploration conducted by our Party in realizing the combination of the basic principles of Marxism and the practice of China's reform and opening up, and reflects the continuous deepening of our Party's understanding of the laws of developing a socialist market economy.
II. the new situation of deepening reform and development and the proposal of the scientific outlook on development
After entering the new century and new stage, China's economic and social development has entered a key period. Faced with the complex situation faced by our country in this key period, the Party Central Committee, with Hu Jintao as the General Secretary, inherited the beneficial thoughts of previous leaders, summarized the historical experience of many years, scientifically analyzed the current situation, and timely proposed the scientific outlook on development.
1. The situation and problems China faces during the critical period of reform and development
The proposal of the scientific outlook on development is not accidental; it is a necessity of the development of the international and domestic situation and the latest summary of the world's development ideas.
From the perspective of the international situation, peace, development, and cooperation are the trend of the times in today's world. The trend of world multipolarity and economic globalization continues to develop deeply, and countries' interdependence is gradually deepening. The relations among major powers are undergoing profound changes, and the balance of world power continues to change. Technological progress is advancing rapidly, scientific and technological innovation and technological diffusion are accelerating, international industrial restructuring and factor transfer are speeding up, regional economic integration is flourishing, and the world economy is entering a new round of recovery and growth. In this development trend of the world, the international community generally holds positive expectations for the development prospects of our country, attaches importance to our role and influence, and the willingness to cooperate with our country is increasing. This is a favorable aspect for our country's development. However, at the same time, we must also soberly realize that our country's development is also facing some major challenges. Hegemonism and power politics still exist, the instability and uncertainty factors affecting world peace and development are increasing, the imbalance in world economic development is intensifying, international competition for resources, markets, technology, and talents is becoming increasingly fierce, trade barriers and trade frictions are increasing, and the pressure from developed countries that have advantages in economy and technology will persist in the long term. The environment we face will continue to be overall favorable to the development of our country, but unfavorable elements may also increase. In the face of such an environment, we must consider China's development in the context of the world's overall situation, play to our strengths, seize favorable conditions, seize opportunities, respond to challenges, accelerate development, and strive to achieve the initiative in development.
From the perspective of the domestic situation, through unremitting efforts since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, especially since the reform and opening up, our country has achieved remarkable development achievements. Significant changes have taken place in productivity, production relations, economic foundation, and superstructure. By 2000, we had achieved the second development goal of the "three-step" strategy for modernization and overall living standards reached a moderately prosperous level. According to the development goals proposed at the 15th National Congress for the year 2010, the centenary of the founding of the party, and the centenary of the founding of New China, the 16th National Congress clearly stated the magnificent goal of comprehensively building a well-off society benefiting more than one billion people during the first 20 years of the 21st century. This is a crucial stage in achieving the strategic goal of modernization and a critical period for improving the socialist market economy and expanding openness to the outside world. The outstanding characteristics and main problems in this period are that our economy and society have entered a new stage of development, and the reform and development have reached a crucial stage. Comprehensive national strength competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the external environment is becoming more complex and changeable. The industrialization and urbanization process in our country is accelerating, economic structural adjustments are speeding up, and a large number of surplus labor in rural areas are transferring to non-agricultural areas. The degree of economic marketization is rapidly improving, deepening reforms further touch upon deep-seated contradictions and problems, and institutional innovation has entered a key stage. Regional development imbalance, economic and social development imbalance, narrowing regional development gaps and promoting coordinated economic and social development have become more difficult tasks. The degree of external dependency of our economy continues to increase, and the impact of the world economy on our country's development is becoming more pronounced. The material and cultural needs of the people are constantly improving and becoming more diverse, and social interests are becoming more diverse and complex, making it more difficult to balance and consider the interests of all parties. The awareness of democracy and the rule of law among the people is constantly strengthening, the enthusiasm for political participation is continuously increasing, and new requirements have been put forward for developing socialist democratic politics and implementing the basic strategy of governing the country according to law. The channels through which people are influenced by various ideological concepts have increased significantly and deepened, and the independence, selectivity, and variability of ideological activities have been significantly enhanced. Mastering the complex situation and striving for good and fast development has become a new era issue facing the Party Central Committee led by General Secretary Hu Jintao.
Looking at the experience of world development, reaching a per capita GDP of $1000 is an important milestone for economic development, which means that economic development has reached a new level and is at a crucial juncture. When a country's per capita income surpasses 1000 US dollars, there may be two different prospects and outcomes: some countries soar and thrive, while others stagnate. Only with appropriate responses can development be accelerated. Some countries and regions in East Asia have effectively managed their relationships and achieved sustained rapid growth during this period, while some countries in Latin America have made missteps, falling into unrest and stagnation, and getting trapped in the "Latin American trap". By 2003, China's per capita GDP had exceeded 1000 US dollars. According to internationally recognized standards, China had stepped out of the ranks of low-income countries. This is a great milestone in the development history of the Chinese nation and has created a new starting point for the more forceful promotion of socialist modernization. After China's economic and social development reached a new starting point, how China can draw on successful development experiences from abroad and avoid repeating their failures has become not only a hot topic for discussion in the field of ideological theory but also a crucial issue that must be considered by the highest decision-making level of the Communist Party of China.
2. The Proposal of the Scientific Outlook on Development
The Scientific Outlook on Development was put forward by the Party Central Committee with Hu Jintao as the General Secretary. It was based on inheriting the ideas about development from Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of the Three Represents. It drew on the development experiences of various countries around the world and learned from the beneficial achievements of foreign development theories. It was proposed based on a profound analysis and understanding of the characteristics of China's development stages.
As early as March 1999, Hu Jintao put forward the idea of "firmly establishing the notion that development is the absolute principle and establishing a scientific outlook on development" during his participation in the deliberation of the Fujian delegation at the Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress. On April 15, 2003, during an inspection in Guangdong, Hu Jintao specifically proposed the idea of "adhering to a comprehensive outlook on development". On July 28, at the National Conference on SARS Prevention and Control, Hu Jintao pointed out, "Through the fight against SARS, we have come to a deeper understanding that the economic development, social development, urban development, and rural development in our country are not sufficiently coordinated... We must attach great importance to the problems that exist and take practical measures to solve them, truly turning this fight against SARS into an important opportunity for improving our work and promoting the development of our cause." He said, "We emphasize that development is the Party's top priority in governing the country. Here, development not only refers to economic growth but also emphasizes centering on economic construction to achieve comprehensive social development. We must better adhere to a comprehensive outlook on development, coordinated development, and sustainable development. We must more consciously promote the coordinated development of socialist material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization on the basis of economic and social development. We must insist on promoting the comprehensive development of individuals on the foundation of economic and social development and insist on promoting harmony between man and nature. In the process of promoting development, we must not only focus on economic indicators but also pay attention to humanistic indicators, resource indicators, and environmental indicators; we must not only increase investment to promote economic growth but also increase investment to promote social development and protect resources and the environment." In October, the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economy System, adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Party, formally established "putting people first, establishing a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable outlook on development, and promoting comprehensive development of the economy, society, and individuals" as the guiding ideology and principles for deepening economic system reform. On October 14, at the second plenary meeting of the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, Hu Jintao further proposed, "The establishment and implementation of a scientific outlook on comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development have significant implications for better adhering to the strategy that development is the absolute principle. The establishment and implementation of the scientific outlook on development is a summary of the experience of more than 20 years of reform and opening up, an important revelation brought to us by the fight against SARS, and an urgent requirement for advancing the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society." "This outlook on development conforms to the objective laws of social development." Here, the outlook on development that is "people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable" was officially named the "Scientific Outlook on Development".
In February 2004, the CCP Central Committee held a special research class on "establishing and implementing the concept of scientific development" for key provincial and ministerial-level leaders at the Central Party School. Comrade Wen Jiabao, Zeng Qinghong, Zeng Peiyan, and other central leaders explained the important significance of the concept of scientific development and emphasized that putting people first is the essence and core of the concept. They also put forward specific requirements for leaders at all levels to establish and implement the concept of scientific development. As a result, the concept of scientific development has been widely used among the central leadership. On March 10, 2004, at the Central Symposium on Population, Resources, and Environmental Work, Hu Jintao gave a comprehensive and profound explanation of the guiding significance, basic connotation, and basic requirements of the concept of scientific development. He pointed out that adhering to people-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development is a major strategic thought proposed for the development of the party and the country in the new century and new stage, guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents". The concept of scientific development summarizes the successful experience of China's reform, opening up, and modernization construction over more than 20 years, draws lessons from the experiences of other countries in their development process, summarizes the important lessons from overcoming the SARS epidemic, reveals the objective laws of economic and social development, and reflects the Party's new understanding of development issues. Comrades from the whole Party must deeply understand the significant importance of establishing and implementing the concept of scientific development from the strategic perspective of implementing the important thought of "Three Represents" and the spirit of the 16th National Congress, and firmly establish and implement the concept of scientific development to better accomplish the historical tasks we bear in the new stage of the new century. To establish and implement the concept of scientific development, it is necessary, first and foremost, to comprehensively and accurately grasp the profound connotation and basic requirements of the concept of scientific development. Putting people first means taking the comprehensive development of individuals as the goal, seeking development and promoting development from the fundamental interests of the people, constantly meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people, effectively safeguarding the economic, political, and cultural rights and interests of the people, and allowing the fruits of development to benefit all the people. Comprehensive development means focusing on economic construction and promoting economic, political, and cultural development comprehensively, achieving economic development and social progress in an all-round way. Coordinated development means coordinating urban and rural development, regional development, economic and social development, harmonious development between man and nature, domestic development and opening up to the outside world, coordinating the coordination between productive forces and production relations, economic base and superstructure. Sustainable development means promoting harmony between man and nature, achieving coordinated economic development, population, resources, and environment, adhering to the civilized development path of promoting production development, living prosperity, and good ecological environment, and ensuring the sustainable development from generation to generation. This exposition deepens the connotation, clarifies the requirements, and strengthens the guiding significance of the concept of scientific development.
In October 2005, the fifth plenary session of the 16th CPC Central Committee put forward that the concept of scientific development is a concentrated embodiment of the worldview and methodology guiding development issues. The "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" thoroughly implemented the requirements of the concept of scientific development, and this plan was reviewed and approved at the fourth session of the Tenth National People's Congress in 2006. This plenary session elevated the concept of scientific development to the level of "worldview and methodology" and further clarified the guiding position of this thought within the entire Party. Since then, General Secretary Hu Jintao has made numerous explanations and instructions on the connotation, core, basic contents, and requirements of the concept of scientific development on different occasions, making it a consensus of the whole Party and the people of the whole country and an important guarantee for realizing the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. In 2007, the 17th National Congress of the Party officially incorporated the concept of scientific development into the Party Constitution and gave it a higher guiding position.
3. The Inheritance and Development of the Marxist Theory by the Concept of Scientific Development
The concept of scientific development is a major strategic thought proposed by our Party under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents". It is based on accurately grasping the trend of world development, summarizing our country's development experience, and analyzing the characteristics of our country's development stages in depth. This major strategic concept is the inheritance and development of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Important Thought of "Three Represents". It is a concentrated reflection of the Marxist worldview and methodology on development and a guiding principle that must be persisted in promoting the comprehensive development of socialist economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, and social construction.
Firstly, the Scientific Development Concept inherits and develops the basic ideas about development in Marxism. It adheres to the basic principles of Marxism, closely integrates with the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, absorbs new achievements in the progress of human civilization, stands at a historical and era height, focuses on enriching the connotation of development, innovating development concepts, exploring development ideas, and solving development difficulties. In terms of development path, development model, development strategy, development driving force, development purpose, and development requirements, it further answers a series of significant questions about why and how China should develop under new circumstances, preliminarily forms a systematic theory on socialist development based on Marxism, and inherits and develops the general ideas of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Important Thought of "Three Represents" on the connotation, essence, purpose, and requirements of development. In summary, it emphasizes that human society is constantly progressing, and development is the eternal theme of human society; it emphasizes the coordination and sustainability of development and advocates the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature; it emphasizes that the ultimate goal of development is to achieve overall societal progress and comprehensive human development. This developmental perspective indicates that our Party, based on upholding the Marxist view on development, has reached a new level of understanding of development issues, the laws of social development, the laws of socialist construction, and laws of Communist Party governance. It embodies the Party's progress in its view on development.
Secondly, the Scientific Development Concept embodies the methodology of Marxism in the understanding of what development is and how to achieve it. It reveals the correct path of economic and social development in China and is the fundamental methodology for guiding our development. The Scientific Development Concept demands the proper handling of a series of significant relationships in the socialist modernization construction, such as the relationship between economic development and social development, development speed and efficiency, market mechanisms and macroeconomic regulation, reform and development stability. It emphasizes the comprehensive promotion of economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, and social construction, achieving economic development and comprehensive social progress, and paying attention to the coordination between urban and rural development, regional development, economic and social development, harmonious development between humans and nature, as well as coordination between domestic development and opening up to the outside world. The basic requirement of the Scientific Development Concept is to give comprehensive consideration to various factors, which runs through the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. It is the application and extension of the Marxist worldview, values, and methodology to the development issue. In practice, implementing the Scientific Development Concept means adhering to the "Five Coordinations". The "Five Coordinations" are the fundamental policy orientation and guiding principles for the Party to lead economic and social development. Truly achieving the "Five Coordinations" will inevitably result in comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development, economic development, and comprehensive social progress, as well as harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Essentially, the Scientific Development Concept is a materialistic and dialectical view of development, which embodies the basic principles of dialectical materialism regarding the universal connections and dialectical unity between things. It realizes the unity of worldview and methodology and embodies the consistency between development goals and means.
Lastly, the Scientific Development Concept adheres to the people-oriented principle and embodies the Marxist values. Putting people first is the consistent social value orientation of Marxism. It emphasizes respecting the existence value, demand value, and development value of individuals, which is an important feature of Marxist theory on social development. Historical materialism scientifically clarifies the laws of human social development while indicating the laws of the masses creating history. The scientific development concept clearly puts forward the principle of putting people first and emphasizes that it is the "essence and core" of the scientific development concept. Everything is for the people, relying on the people, taking the masses as the main body and basic force to promote development, and taking the satisfaction of the growing material and cultural needs of the people as the fundamental starting point and foothold of development. This fully embodies the fundamental value orientation of the Marxist party and is a prominent manifestation of the socialist values. Therefore, it is also an inevitable conclusion that combines the historical materialism principle of putting people first with the nature and purpose of our party to establish the party for the public and govern for the people.
III. A series of important strategic decisions to promote scientific development
The formulation of the comprehensive goal of building a well-off society and the proposal of the scientific development concept have provided guarantees for China's society to embark on the path of scientific development. Based on this foundation, the Party has successively launched a series of major strategic decisions to ensure the healthy and rapid development of China's society.
The proposal of the scientific development concept is a summary of the experience of our party in the practice of reform and opening up for more than 20 years, reflecting the Communist Party of China's new understanding of development issues and embodying the urgent requirements for building a well-off society in an all-round way. It conforms to the trend of the times and is in line with the contemporary Chinese national conditions.
To effectively implement the scientific development concept and promote scientific development, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council have taken a series of major measures:
First, further strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control. In response to new problems in the economy and people's livelihood, such as food, investment, coal and electricity shortages, the central government has grasped the main contradictions and key aspects, taken targeted measures in credit, land, agricultural production, and other aspects to regulate unhealthy and unstable factors in economic operation, preventing large fluctuations in the national economy and maintaining the momentum of sustained and rapid economic growth.
Second, improve the socialist market economy system. In October 2003, the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Party passed the "Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economy System" (referred to as the "Decision"), which clarifies the goals and main tasks of improving the socialist market economy system. The "Decision" proposes that the main goal of improving the socialist market economy system is: in accordance with the requirements of overall planning for urban-rural development, regional development, economic and social development, harmonious development between man and nature, domestic development and opening-up, to give full play to the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation, enhance corporate vitality and competitiveness, improve the national macro-control system, improve government social management and public service functions, and provide strong institutional guarantees for building a well-off society in all respects. The main tasks are: to improve the basic economic system in which the public ownership is the mainstay and multiple forms of ownership develop together; to establish a mechanism conducive to gradually changing the dual economic structure of urban and rural areas; to form a mechanism for promoting coordinated regional economic development; to construct a modern market economy system that is unified, open, and orderly competitive; to improve the macro-control system, administrative management system, and economic legal system; to improve the employment, income distribution, and social security system; to establish a mechanism for promoting sustainable economic and social development. The "Decision" embodies the requirements of the scientific development concept, makes the objectives of economic system reform more clear, and is another guiding document for developing a socialist market economy in our country.
Third, propose the overall strategy of coordinated regional development. In accordance with the requirements of the scientific development concept, the central government adheres to overall consideration, rational planning, giving play to advantages, and implementing policies to continually make new deployments for coordinated regional development. In March 2004, the State Council issued the "Opinions on Further Promoting the Development of the Western Region", proposing to strengthen economic exchanges and cooperation between the western region and the eastern and central regions, establish a market-oriented cooperative mechanism across regions and enterprises, combine the advantages of funds, technology, and talents in the eastern and central regions with the resources, markets, and labor force advantages in the western region, achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefit, and common development. In October 2005, the 5th Plenary Session of the 16th Party Central Committee, on the basis of summarizing the experience of socialist modernization in China, further proposed the overall strategy for regional development in China. It emphasized the need to continue promoting the development of the western regions, revitalizing the old industrial bases such as the northeast region, promoting the rise of the central region, encouraging the eastern region to develop first, and forming a reasonable regional development pattern. Starting from the actual situation in various regions, the 5th Plenary Session clarified the development orientation and overall approach of each region. It emphasized the need to establish a sound mechanism for regional coordination and interaction, clarify the functional positioning of different regions, and promote the healthy development of urbanization. These were the three main aspects of implementing the strategy for coordinated regional development. 
The fourth aspect was to formulate the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan". In October 2005, the 5th Plenary Session of the 16th Party Central Committee passed the "Suggestions on Formulating the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development" (referred to as the "Suggestions"). The "Suggestions" took into account the trends and conditions for China's development in the next five years, and proposed the main goals for the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan": to achieve a doubling of per capita GDP in 2010 compared to 2000; to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by about 20% compared to the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan period; to effectively curb the deterioration of the ecological environment and control the excessive reduction of arable land; to form a group of companies with independent intellectual property rights, well-known brands, and strong international competitiveness; to have a relatively comprehensive socialist market economy system, reaching a new level in an open economy, and achieving basic balance in international payments; to popularize and consolidate nine-year compulsory education, continuously increase urban employment opportunities, have a relatively sound social security system, and further reduce the number of people living in poverty; to generally raise the income level and quality of life of urban and rural residents, maintain overall price stability, and greatly improve conditions in terms of housing, transportation, education, culture, healthcare, and the environment; to make new progress in the construction of democracy, the legal system, and spiritual civilization; to further improve social security and work safety, and make new progress in building a harmonious society. In accordance with the above goals, China will comprehensively promote socialist modernization. 
The fifth aspect was to strengthen the construction of a socialist new countryside, deepen rural reform, and effectively strengthen the foundation of agriculture. In December 2002, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee held a meeting, emphasizing that the issues of agriculture, rural areas, and farmers should be regarded as the top priority of the work of the entire Party and be given more prominent positions. From 2004 to 2008, the Central Committee issued documents on rural issues for five consecutive years in the form of the "Number One Document". The 5th Plenary Session of the 16th Party Central Committee in 2005 put forward the historical task of building a socialist new countryside and defined the construction goals as "developing production, improving living standards, promoting civilized rural customs, creating tidy village environment, and implementing democratic management". In early 2006, the Central Committee issued the "Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Advancing the Construction of a Socialist New Countryside" in the form of the "Number One Document", providing comprehensive guidance for the construction of a socialist new countryside. In order to accelerate the construction of a socialist new countryside, the Party Central Committee responded to the changes in the stage of economic and social development and clearly proposed the establishment of a long-term mechanism of "industry-led agriculture, towns supporting rural areas", adhered to the principle of "giving more, taking less, and letting go", focused on "giving more", promoted the development of modern agriculture, and strengthened the industrial support for the construction of a socialist new countryside. In terms of deepening rural reform, the Party Central Committee, based on accelerating the process of rural tax and fee reform and gradually reducing and exempting agricultural taxes, made the decision to abolish agricultural taxes. On December 29, 2005, the 19th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress officially decided to formally abolish the "Regulations on Agricultural Taxes" from January 1, 2006. The abolition of agricultural taxes put an end to the historical "imperial grain tax" that had existed in China for over two thousand years, marking a historic change in the pattern of national income distribution. Since then, rural reform has entered a comprehensive reform stage with the main content of township institution, rural compulsory education, and county-town fiscal and taxation management system reforms. 
The sixth aspect was to build an innovative country. Innovation is the soul of national progress and an inexhaustible driving force for a country's prosperity and development. Since the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the central government has made significant decisions to promote independent innovation and build an innovative country, starting from the overall goal of building a well-off society and pioneering China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. After nearly five years of improvement and development, in January 2006, Hu Jintao formally put forward the main goal of building an innovative country for China at the opening ceremony of the National Science and Technology Conference. The goal is to significantly enhance China's capacity for independent innovation by 2020, significantly enhance the ability of science and technology to promote economic and social development and ensure national security, significantly enhance the comprehensive strength of basic science and cutting-edge technology research, achieve a number of significant scientific and technological achievements with global impact, and enter the ranks of innovative countries, providing strong support for the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.
The seventh goal is to promote the construction of socialist democratic politics in an orderly manner and strive to build socialist political civilization. The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China identified the development of socialist democratic politics and the construction of socialist political civilization as important goals to build a well-off society in an all-around way, and called for the continued active and steady promotion of political system reform. After the 16th National Congress, while promoting the development of material civilization and spiritual civilization, the central government has continuously improved and perfected the system of people's congresses, strengthened the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, expanded grassroots democracy, and steadily promoted the rule of law with Chinese characteristics, so as to ensure that the political system reform is in line with the goal of building socialist political civilization.
The eighth goal is to deepen the reform of the cultural system and promote the prosperity of advanced socialist culture. With the economic transition and social transformation, the economic foundation, institutional environment, and social conditions for cultural construction and development in China have undergone profound changes. The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China called on all comrades of the Party to deeply understand the strategic significance of cultural construction, promote the development and prosperity of socialist culture, and put forward the urgent need to formulate an overall plan for the reform of the cultural system. From June 27th to 28th, 2003, the National Conference on Pilot Work of Cultural System Reform studied and deployed the pilot work of cultural system reform. On December 23, 2005, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Cultural System," which clearly stated that the goal and task of cultural system reform is to take development as the theme, reform as the driving force, institutional and mechanism innovation as the focus, form a scientifically efficient macro cultural management system, a micro operation mechanism for efficient cultural production and service, a cultural industry pattern with public ownership as the main body and the coordinated, open, competitive, and orderly modern cultural market system; form a sound cultural innovation system, a cultural opening pattern that takes national culture as the main body and absorbs beneficial foreign cultures, and promote the Chinese culture to go global. In March 2006, the National Conference on Cultural System Reform summarized the pilot work of cultural system reform and made specific arrangements for promoting the reform. As a result, the reform of the cultural system has entered a new stage. The pilot areas further transformed the functions of the government based on the principles of separating politics and enterprises, separating politics and administration, and separating management and operation. The reform of public cultural undertakings deepened further, and the capacity and level of public services significantly improved. The operation of cultural enterprises made breakthrough progress towards enterprise-oriented and market-oriented management, and a large number of large-scale cultural groups have gradually formed.
In the process of promoting scientific development, the central government of the Communist Party of China has gained a clearer understanding of the institutional and systemic contradictions accumulated in China's long-term economic and social development, as well as the new situations and problems it faces. The understanding of the objective laws of economic and social development has further deepened. Grasping the laws of development, innovating development concepts, transforming development modes, solving development difficulties, and improving the quality and efficiency of development have gradually become the consensus of the whole party. On this basis, the central government of the Communist Party of China further put forward the requirement of "good and fast" development. In December 2006, the Central Economic Work Conference clearly stated: "We must deeply understand that achieving good and fast development is the fundamental requirement for fully implementing the scientific outlook on development...". "From "fast and good" to "good and fast", although it is only a change in the sequence of two words, it better reflects the inherent requirements of the scientific development concept, reflects the sublimation of the party's guiding ideology on development issues, makes the whole party have a more comprehensive grasp of the laws of development in the new stage, and makes the guiding principles for development more in line with reality and the approach to solving development difficulties more clear.
IV. strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capability and advancedness
Strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capability and continuously improving the governing capacity and level has always been an important aspect of the ideological construction of the proletarian party. As early as the establishment of the Soviet regime, Lenin proposed: "How to consolidate power after the Communist Party comes to power will be a "new and extraordinarily difficult task", "this is a severe test". And he demanded that every member of the Soviet Communist Party "enrich their minds with all the knowledge created by mankind" and continuously improve the Party's governance capacity and level. After the founding of New China, several generations of Chinese Communists have always regarded strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capability as a major task. In the new century and the new stage, the Party Central Committee with Hu Jintao as the General Secretary, based on the needs of the new situation and new tasks, specifically made decisions to strengthen the construction of the Party's governance capability.
On the eve of the establishment of New China, facing the new situation of our party becoming the ruling party, Mao Zedong once cautioned the entire party, "to achieve national victory, this is just the first step after the long march of ten thousand li", "but the journey after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous". The task of governing the country throughout the country was like "entering Beijing to take the imperial examination". Mao Zedong's thoughts initially put forward requirements for strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capability. After the reform and opening up, our Party has always attached importance to solving the two historical issues of improving the Party's governance capacity and leadership level and improving the Party's ability to resist corruption and risks. After entering the new century, with the profound changes in the international and domestic political and economic situation, more severe challenges have been posed to our Party's governance capacity and leadership level, and new and higher requirements have been put forward for strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capacity.
To adapt to the requirements of the new situation and development, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, based on the historical position of our Party and the historical mission bestowed by the times, and from the strategic height of ensuring long-term stability of the Party and the state, clearly put forward the basic requirements for continuously improving the construction of the five aspects of governance capability: First, continuously improving the ability to scientifically judge the situation. Second, continuously improving the ability to manage the market economy. Third, continuously improving the ability to cope with complex situations. Fourth, continuously improving the ability to govern in accordance with the law. Fifth, continuously improving the ability to oversee the overall situation.
In order to firmly and effectively address the issue of strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capacity, on September 7, 2004, the new Central Committee of the Party convened a meeting of the Politburo to discuss the work of the Central Politburo since the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, and further studied the issue of strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capacity. On September 19, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening the Construction of the Party's Governance Capability, which was adopted at the plenary session, comprehensively analyzed the current situation and tasks, scientifically summarized the main experiences of the Party's governance, and made clear the guiding ideology, overall goals, and major tasks for strengthening the construction of the Party's governance capability."
The so-called governing capacity of the Party is: the Party puts forward and applies correct theories, lines, principles, policies, and strategies, leads the formulation and implementation of the constitution and laws, adopts scientific leadership systems and methods, mobilizes and organizes the people to manage national and social affairs, economic and cultural undertakings according to law, effectively governs the Party, the country, and the military, and builds the ability to construct a socialist modernized country. 
The guiding ideology for strengthening the construction of the Party's governing capacity is: it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of "Three Represents", fully implement the concept of scientific development, fully implement the Party's basic line, basic program, and basic experience, with the core being to maintain the close ties between the Party and the people, the key being to build a high-quality cadre team, the focus being on reforming and improving the Party's leadership system and working mechanism, and the foundation being to strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations and Party members, striving to embody the characteristics of the times, grasp regularities, and be rich in creativity.
The overall goal of strengthening the construction of the Party's governing capacity is: through the joint efforts of the whole Party, the Party will always be a governing party that stands for the public and governs for the people, a governing party that governs scientifically, democratically, and according to the law, a governing party that is practical, innovative, efficient, and clean, and ultimately a Marxist governing party that always adheres to the "Three Represents", maintains advancement, and withstands various tests and challenges.
The main tasks of strengthening the construction of the Party's governing capacity are: in accordance with the requirements of promoting the coordinated development of socialist material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization, continuously improving the ability to manage the socialist market economy, develop socialist democratic politics, build advanced socialist culture, construct a harmonious socialist society, and deal with international situations and handle international affairs.
In addition, based on the "five aspects of governing capacity" proposed at the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC on Strengthening the Construction of the Party's Governing Capacity also made specific strategic deployments for enhancing the construction of the Party's governing capacity.
According to the relevant deployments of the Central Committee, in order to effectively strengthen the construction of the Party's governing capacity, ensure that the Party always takes the lead in the times and better shoulder its historical mission, on November 7, 2004, the Central Committee of the CPC issued the Opinions on Carrying out the Education Activity of Preserving the Advancement of Communist Party Members with the Important Thought of "Three Represents" in Practice as the Main Content (referred to as the "Opinions"), making specific deployments for the educational activity:
In terms of overall requirements, the overall goal is to improve the quality of Party members, strengthen grassroots organizations, serve the people, and promote various work. In terms of the overall process, this educational activity will be conducted in three batches, with each batch lasting about six months. The first batch includes county-level and above Party and government organs and some enterprises and institutions. It starts from January 2005 and ends by June 2005. The second batch includes urban grassroots and township government offices. It starts from July 2005 and ends by December 2005. The third batch is in rural areas and some Party and government organs. It starts from January 2006 and ends by June 2006. In terms of methods and steps, the education will be conducted in three stages: learning and mobilization, analysis and evaluation, and rectification and improvement.
After the issuance of the "Opinions", on January 5-6, 2005, the CPC Central Committee held a work conference on the educational activity of preserving the advancement of Communist Party members, making specific deployments for the educational work. According to the overall arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, the members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee participated in the first batch of educational activities. On January 14, at the symposium on maintaining the advancement of Communist Party members in the new era, Hu Jintao delivered an important speech on strengthening the construction of the Party's advancement and carrying out educational activities, emphasizing the importance and necessity of preserving the advancement of Communist Party members in the new era, and the basic requirements for Communist Party members to maintain advancement. He called on all Party members to actively participate in the educational activity of preserving the advancement, and especially demanded that leading cadres play a leading role and effectively carry out the educational activity.
After the Central Advanced Education Work Conference, the activities to maintain the advanced education of Communist Party members were carried out in three phases starting from January 2005, and basically concluded by June 2006. In a year and a half, more than 3.5 million grass-roots party organizations and nearly 70 million party members participated in the education activities for advancing the Party's development. From a practical perspective, the entire education activities were conducted in a healthy and orderly manner, with solid work and smooth progress. They have achieved relatively significant results in advancing the Party's development and enhancing its governing capacity, and have received praise from the majority of party members, cadres, the masses, and the wider society.
V. adhere to the path of peaceful development and advocate the establishment of a harmonious world.
Entering a new stage in the new century, China's socialist modernization construction has embraced a new strategic opportunity period. Under the leadership of General Secretary Hu Jintao, the Party Central Committee has led the whole Party and the entire nation to face a series of new changes in the international and domestic environment. While accelerating economic development, it has also paid more attention to the modernization of the military and national defense, actively carried out diplomatic work, and made efforts to promote the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland, actively safeguarding the strategic opportunity period.
To achieve synchronous development of national defense construction and the national economy, adapt to the development and changes in the international military situation after entering the 21st century, the Party Central Committee has demanded that the entire military actively respond to the severe challenges of the new global military revolution. It has called for the promotion of the Chinese military's characteristic reform without delay, and striving to achieve the dual historical tasks of mechanization and informatization construction, and resolutely realize the strategic goal of building an informatized military and winning informatized warfare. On September 20, 2004, at an expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission, Hu Jintao, who had just assumed the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission, proposed to continuously enhance the ability to strengthen the ideological and political construction of the troops and master the correct direction of their development, continuously improve the ability to lead the military struggle preparations and lead the troops to accomplish combat missions under the conditions of informatization, continuously enhance the ability to promote the Chinese military's characteristic reform and promote the mechanization and informatization construction of the troops, and continuously enhance the ability to govern the troops strictly in accordance with the law and strengthen the standardized construction of the troops.
On March 13, 2005, Hu Jintao delivered an important speech at the plenary meeting of the delegation of the People's Liberation Army of the 10th National People's Congress, putting forward new requirements on the historical mission of our army on behalf of the Central Military Commission. These requirements are to provide important support for the Party in consolidating its ruling position, to provide strong security guarantees for safeguarding the country's important strategic opportunities, to provide powerful strategic support for safeguarding national interests, and to play an important role in maintaining world peace and promoting common development. This new mission entrusted by the Party and the Central Military Commission to our army has epoch-making significance.
To fulfill this mission, our army has further accelerated the pace of reform along the road of China's characteristics of being an elite force. Following the large-scale downsizing in the mid-1980s and the further reduction of 500,000 troops in the mid-to-late 1990s, in September 2003, the Chinese government decided to further reduce the military personnel by 200,000 before 2005. While reducing military personnel, the country has increased investment in national defense construction. The political and military quality of the officers and soldiers of the whole army has been greatly improved, and weapons and equipment as well as the defense technology industry have made rapid progress.
Since the 16th National Congress of the Party, the most noticeable aspect of China's diplomacy has been the advocating and active promotion of the construction of a "harmonious world." This international strategic idea reflects the basic judgment and value pursuit of the Communist Party of China on the current international situation, global issues, and the future of mankind. It is a new summary of China's independent, self-reliant, and peaceful diplomatic policy objectives in the new era.
On April 22, 2005, at the Asia-Africa Summit in Jakarta, President Hu Jintao issued an appeal to all countries in the world, proposing to "promote friendly coexistence, equal dialogue, and common development among different civilizations, and jointly build a harmonious world." This was the first time that the concept of building a "harmonious world" was put forward. On July 1st, the leaders of China and Russia held a summit and included the concept of "harmonious world" in the Joint Statement on the International Order of the 21st Century, marking the first confirmation of consensus between the two major countries. On September 15th, Hu Jintao delivered a speech titled "Striving to Build a Harmonious World of Lasting Peace and Common Prosperity" at the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, proposing that "in the face of today's complex and diverse world, we should attach greater importance to harmony, emphasize harmony, promote harmony, and build a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity," comprehensively elucidating the abundant connotations of the "harmonious world." In August 2006, the Party Central Committee held the National Conference on Foreign Affairs, establishing the construction of a "harmonious world" as the goal of China's diplomatic work.
In order to promote the construction of a harmonious world, the Chinese government has actively carried out a series of fruitful diplomatic activities. China's relations with major countries have remained stable and developed, and its friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries have continued to consolidate.
In 2003, the second Forum on China-Africa Cooperation adopted the Addis Ababa Action Plan (2004-2006), planning cooperation in various fields such as economy, trade, and society for the next three years. After signing the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation between China and ASEAN in 2002, China and ASEAN countries signed the Agreement on Trade in Goods and the Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism in November 2004, stipulating the gradual elimination of most bilateral trade tariffs and other trade barriers by 2010. From November 28th to 30th, Wen Jiabao visited Laos and attended the 8th ASEAN-China Leaders' Meeting (10+1) held in Vientiane, where he delivered the "Action Plan for Implementing the Joint Declaration on Building a Strategic Partnership of Peace and Prosperity between China and ASEAN." In April 2005, Wen Jiabao visited Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India, and attended the fourth Asian Cooperation Dialogue Ministerial Meeting held in Islamabad. During the visit, China and Pakistan, China and India announced the establishment of strategic cooperative partnerships, while China and Bangladesh, China and Sri Lanka announced the establishment of comprehensive cooperative partnerships. China and India signed the Agreement on Political Guidelines for the Settlement of the Boundary Question, recognizing for the first time the principle of adjusting the existing boundaries. In the same month, Hu Jintao attended the Asian-African Summit and the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Bandung Conference held in Indonesia, comprehensively elaborating China's clear stance on win-win cooperation with Asian and African countries: mutual respect and support in politics; complementary strengths and mutual benefit in economy; learning from each other and making up for each other's shortcomings in culture; equal trust and dialogue and cooperation in security. On June 2nd, China and Russia exchanged the Instrument of Ratification for the Supplementary Agreement to the Sino-Russian Boundary East Section, marking the complete resolution of all historical boundary issues between China and Russia. With China's promotion, all parties finally reached a document with the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in September 2005. On November 20th, during a meeting with U.S. President Bush, Hu Jintao proposed five suggestions for further developing the constructive cooperative relationship between China and the United States, further promoting the development of the constructive cooperative relationship between the two countries.
By 2008, China had participated in more than 100 intergovernmental international organizations, more than 300 international conventions, and 22 UN peacekeeping operations, sending tens of thousands of peacekeeping personnel, making it the country that has sent the most peacekeeping personnel among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. China actively participates in international and regional affairs, conscientiously fulfilling its corresponding international responsibilities, and has become an important member of the international system.
Through active efforts, China's diplomacy has developed in a parallel manner with bilateral and multilateral approaches, giving equal weight to traditional security and non-traditional security, and a new model of comprehensive development and mutually reinforcing in politics, economy, diplomacy, military, culture, and other aspects has begun to take shape.
Since the 16th National Congress, the new central leadership collective has strictly adhered to the policy of "one country, two systems" in dealing with the issues of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions, and has implemented some important measures in accordance with the new situations in the development of Hong Kong and Macau. In cross-strait relations, the central government has actively responded to new changes in the situation across the Taiwan Strait and taken some significant and positive steps. The struggle against "Taiwan independence" and the defense of national sovereignty have made new progress.
Since Hong Kong and Macau returned to the motherland, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, have consistently regarded the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau as the fundamental starting point and foothold for handling Hong Kong and Macau affairs. They have unwaveringly implemented the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong", "Macau people administering Macau", and high degree of autonomy, as well as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. They have firmly supported the Chief Executives and governments of the special administrative regions in governing according to the law.
The central government has provided full support to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. Not only have they taken effective measures to help Hong Kong and Macau successfully overcome the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis, but they have also strengthened the connections between the mainland and Hong Kong/Macau, carried out exchanges and cooperation in various fields, implemented policies such as regional cooperation in the Pan-Pearl River Delta, and promoted the common development of Hong Kong, Macau, and the mainland. These efforts have provided a broader development space for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. With the support of the central government and the mainland compatriots, the economy of Hong Kong and Macau has become more prosperous, democracy has developed in an orderly manner, the people live and work in peace and stability. The majority of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots love the motherland, care about Hong Kong and Macau, and demonstrate a spirit of diligence and progress.
After the return of Hong Kong and Macau, cross-strait relations have attracted more attention from the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Based on changes in cross-strait relations and the situation in Taiwan, the central government has put forward new propositions and taken new steps to continuously develop cross-strait relations, while adhering to the existing policies.
On March 4, 2005, General Secretary Hu Jintao put forward four points of views on the development of cross-strait relations in the new situation. It emphasized that the principle of "one China" would never waver, efforts for peaceful reunification would not be abandoned, the policy of relying on the Taiwanese people would not change, and the compromise with "Taiwan independence" activities would not be made. These four "never" propositions have had significant repercussions in cross-strait relations and the international community, receiving widespread welcome and high praise. On March 14, the Third Session of the Tenth National People's Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law with a high vote, which legally established the central government's major policies concerning the resolution of the Taiwan question and opposition to the secession of the motherland. The formulation and passage of this law fully reflect the consistent position of the Communist Party of China to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and utmost effort, and also demonstrate the firm determination of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to safeguard national unity and territorial integrity.
Under the guidance of the correct policies of the central government and with the efforts of all parties, political party exchanges have been successfully initiated between the two sides of the strait. In 2005, Lien Chan, Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as James Soong, Chairman of the People First Party, and Vincent Siew, Chairman of the New Party, visited the mainland with their delegations. General Secretary Hu Jintao respectively met and held talks with them, jointly issued a joint statement, and reached consensus on maintaining the "1992 Consensus", opposing "Taiwan independence", seeking peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and promoting the development of cross-strait relations. Through the three Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forums held successively by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Nationalist Party, the mainland has introduced 48 policy measures to promote communication and cooperation between the two sides of the strait and benefit Taiwanese compatriots. These measures include expanding the sale of Taiwanese agricultural products in the mainland, recognizing the academic qualifications approved by Taiwan's education authorities for higher education institutions, allowing Taiwanese compatriots who meet the specified conditions to apply for professional registration and short-term medical practice on the mainland, and so on. The Communist Party of China and the People First Party have also held the "Cross-Strait Elites Forum". Through extensive exchanges and cooperation between the two sides' political parties, a new situation has been opened up to contain "Taiwan independence" activities and promote the development of cross-strait relations. The "Taiwan independence" activities such as "legal independence," "new constitution referendum," and "joining the United Nations in the name of Taiwan" have been repeatedly defeated by the Taiwan authorities. The struggle against "Taiwan independence" has also received extensive understanding and support from the international community. Many influential countries have reiterated their adherence to the policy of "One China." In September 2007, the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly rejected the so-called "Taiwan joining the United Nations" proposal instigated by the Chen Shui-bian administration with the support of only a few countries. In March 2008, Taiwan held a general election, and the Chen Shui-bian administration, which had been pushing for "Taiwan independence," was finally abandoned by the Taiwanese people. The Kuomintang regained its governing position, and cross-strait relations underwent favorable changes conducive to peaceful development.
Chapter 12: Implementing the Scientific Outlook on Development and Building a Harmonious Socialist Society
Since the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of General Secretary Hu Jintao, the Party Central Committee has, in the practice of building a well-off society in an all-round way, put forward the concept of the scientific outlook on development to achieve better and faster development of socialist modernization in our country. It has further summarized the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and, guided by the scientific outlook on development, put forward new requirements for the struggle to build a well-off society in an all-round way. It has promoted the construction of a harmonious society, deepened reforms in the administrative system and rural areas, and made a series of strategic decisions to promote the development of social sciences in our country, driving the continuous healthy development of our society.
I. A New Summary of the Theoretical System of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
From October 15 to 21, 2007, the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. The theme of the congress was: Hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, follow the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents, comprehensively implement the scientific outlook on development, continue to emancipate the mind, adhere to the reform and opening-up, promote scientific development, promote social harmony, and strive for new victories in building a well-off society in an all-round way. Hu Jintao, on behalf of the 16th Central Committee, delivered a report entitled "Hold High the Great Banner of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and Strive for New Victories in Building a Well-off Society in an All-round Way." The congress elected a new Central Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, adopted resolutions on the report of the 16th Central Committee, the work report of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China.
The report of the 17th National Congress scientifically answers major questions such as what kind of banner the Party should hold, what path to follow, what kind of mental state to maintain, and what development goals to strive for during the key stage of reform and development. It comprehensively deploys the grand goals of advancing the reform and opening-up, socialist modernization, and building a well-off society in an all-round way, and clearly puts forward specific requirements for promoting the new great project of Party building with a spirit of reform and innovation.
The report of the 17th National Congress comprehensively reviews the historic changes that have taken place over the past 30 years of reform and opening-up in the Chinese people's lives, socialist China's face, and the face of the Communist Party of China. It scientifically summarizes the valuable experience of our country, a big country with over one billion people, in getting rid of poverty, accelerating the modernization drive, and consolidating and developing socialism. The report points out that the fundamental reason for all our achievements and progress since the reform and opening-up can be summed up as opening up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and forming the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics means that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, based on China's basic national conditions, with economic construction as the central task, we adhere to the four cardinal principles, stick to reform and opening-up, liberate and develop social productive forces, consolidate and improve the socialist system, and build a socialist market economy, socialist democracy, socialist advanced culture, and socialist harmonious society, and strive to build a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modernized country.
The theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics includes scientific theories such as Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of Three Represents, and the scientific outlook on development.
The proposal of the "Theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" is a scientific integration of our party's innovative theories in the new historical period of reform and opening up. It is a scientific expression of the openness of the party's theoretical achievements since the reform and opening up, a significant theoretical contribution of the 17th National Congress, and the latest achievement in the sinicization of Marxism. In the past thirty years, in the great historical process of reform and socialist modernization, our party has adhered to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and keeping pace with the times, continuously promoting the sinicization of Marxism, and has made significant theoretical innovations, thereby forming the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, facing the crisis caused by the "Cultural Revolution" for ten years, the Chinese Communist Party, represented mainly by Deng Xiaoping, has scientifically evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought with great theoretical courage and political courage, completely negating the erroneous theory and practice of "class struggle as the key" and making historic decisions to prioritize economic construction and implement reform and opening up, opening a new period of socialist development. In practice, through continuous summarization of experience and theoretical exploration, we have gradually gained a clearer understanding of "what is socialism, and how to build socialism," gradually forming Deng Xiaoping Theory.
Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Chinese Communist Party, represented mainly by Jiang Zemin, has upheld the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhered to reform and opening up, kept pace with the times, successfully pushed forward the cause of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century, and deepened their understanding of "what is socialism, how to build socialism" and "what kind of party to build, and how to build the party" in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, forming the important thought of "Three Represents," thus enriching and developing the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Since the Sixteenth National Congress, the Party Central Committee, with Hu Jintao as its General Secretary, based on new development requirements and the basic national conditions of the primary stage of socialism, has continuously summed up China's development experience and drawn on foreign development experience, initially answered major theoretical and practical questions such as "what kind of development to achieve and how to promote development," and put forward a series of strategic thoughts such as the Scientific Outlook on Development. The Scientific Outlook on Development is the inheritance and development of the important thoughts on development by the three generations of the Party's Central Collective Leadership, the concentrated embodiment of the Marxist worldview and methodology on development, and a scientific theory that inherits and advances the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of "Three Represents." It is an important guiding principle for the economic and social development of our country and a major strategic thought that must be adhered to and implemented to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents" were written into the Party Constitution at the Fifteenth and Sixteenth National Congresses, and established as the Party's guiding ideology. The Seventeenth National Congress unanimously agreed to include the Scientific Outlook on Development in the Party Constitution.
The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics adheres to and develops Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and embodies the wisdom and efforts of several generations of Chinese Communists in leading the people's tireless exploration. It is the latest achievement in sinicizing Marxism, the most valuable political and spiritual wealth of the Party, and the common ideological foundation for the unity and struggle of people of all ethnic groups in the country. The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is an open and developing theoretical system. The practice of nearly 160 years since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" has proven that Marxism can only flourish with the combination of the national conditions, the progress of the times, and the common destiny with the people. In contemporary China, adhering to the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics means truly upholding Marxism.
II. The new requirements of achieving the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the overall layout of the "Four Comprehensives"
Adhering to the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, from a practical perspective, means adapting to the new changes in the domestic and international situation, meeting the new expectations of all ethnic groups for a better life, and deeply implementing and striving to achieve the new requirements of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society as proposed at the 17th National Congress.
1. New requirements for achieving the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects
We have taken solid steps towards the goal of building a moderately prosperous society set at the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In the future, we must continue to strive and ensure the achievement of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020. In this regard, the 17th National Congress of the Party has further put forward the following new requirements:
(1) Enhance development coordination and strive to achieve good and fast economic development. Significant progress has been made in transforming the development mode. Based on optimizing the structure, improving efficiency, reducing consumption, and protecting the environment, we aim to double per capita GDP by 2020 compared to the year 2000. The socialist market economy system is more perfected. The ability of independent innovation has significantly improved, and the contribution rate of technological progress to economic growth has greatly increased, making China an innovative country. The consumption rate of residents steadily improves, forming a growth pattern driven by coordinated consumption, investment, and exports. Mechanisms and layouts for coordinated and interactive development between urban and rural areas and regions have basically formed. Significant progress has been made in the construction of new socialist countryside. The urban population proportion has clearly increased.
(2) Expand socialist democracy and better safeguard people's rights and social fairness and justice. Citizen political participation is orderly expanding. The basic strategy of ruling the country by law is being further implemented, and the legal concept of the whole society has been further enhanced, achieving new results in building a law-based government. The grassroots democratic system is more perfected. The government's ability to provide basic public services has significantly enhanced.
(3) Strengthen cultural construction and significantly improve the overall cultural quality of the whole nation. The socialist core values have deeply penetrated into people's hearts, and positive cultural and moral trends have been further promoted. A public cultural service system covering the whole society has been basically established, with the proportion of the cultural industry in the national economy significantly increased and the international competitiveness significantly strengthened, providing richer cultural products that meet the needs of the people.
(4) Accelerate the development of social undertakings and comprehensively improve people's lives. The modern national education system is more perfected, and the lifelong education system has basically formed. The education level of the entire population and the level of training innovative talents have significantly improved. Social employment is more full. A social security system covering urban and rural residents has been basically established, and everyone enjoys basic livelihood security. A rational and orderly income distribution pattern has basically formed, with the majority being middle-income earners and the eradication of absolute poverty. Everyone has access to basic medical and health services. The social governance system is more sound.
(5) Building an ecological civilization, which significantly promotes energy-saving, resource-conserving, and environmentally-friendly industrial structure, growth mode, and consumption pattern. A large-scale circular economy is established, and the proportion of renewable energy significantly increases. Major pollutant emissions are effectively controlled, and the ecological environment quality is noticeably improved. The concept of ecological civilization is firmly established in society as a whole.
By the time the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects is achieved by 2020, our historically profound ancient civilization and socialist developing country will become a nation where industrialization is basically realized, comprehensive national strength is significantly enhanced, and the overall scale of the domestic market ranks among the forefront of the world. It will become a country where people's affluence is universally improved, living standards are noticeably enhanced, and the ecological environment is good. It will become a country where people enjoy more full democratic rights, possess higher levels of civilization and spiritual pursuits. It will become a country with more perfect institutions, a more vibrant and stable society; a country that is more open, more friendly, and makes greater contributions to human civilization.
To implement the above new requirements for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, all Party comrades must "fully grasp the scientific connotation and spiritual essence of the Scientific Outlook on Development, enhance their consciousness and determination to implement the Scientific Outlook on Development, focus on transforming ideological concepts that are not in line with the Scientific Outlook on Development, focus on addressing prominent problems that affect and restrict scientific development, guide the enthusiasm of the whole society towards scientific development, and implement the Scientific Outlook on Development in all aspects of economic and social development."
To thoroughly implement the new requirements for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, an important task is to actively construct a socialist harmonious society. This is because scientific development and social harmony are inherently unified. Without scientific development, social harmony cannot be achieved, and without social harmony, scientific development is difficult to attain. Therefore, to implement the new requirements for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, it is necessary to always prioritize the construction of a socialist harmonious society.
2. Making efforts to construct a socialist harmonious society
Constructing a socialist harmonious society is a major strategic decision made by our Party based on the basic principles of Marxism and the practical experience of socialist construction in our country. It is also a significant achievement attained by our Party through the guidance of developing Marxism and applying it to new social practices in the new century and new stage of our country's economic and social development.
(1) The proposal of the idea of building a socialist harmonious society
A socialist harmonious society is the goal of our Party's unremitting struggle and the common social ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. After the establishment of New China, we established a socialist system in which the people are the masters of the country, thereby eliminating the institutional roots that caused social contradictions and disharmony. This has opened up a broad path for building a harmonious society. However, due to the need for a process of understanding the laws of socialist construction, we have made mistakes in understanding what socialism is and how to build socialism. We even experienced a severe and long-lasting mistake like the "Cultural Revolution". After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, our party decisively abandoned the guideline of "taking class struggle as the key link" and shifted the focus of the party and the state's work to socialist modernization, insisting on economic development as the central task and firmly promoting reform and opening up. We actively promote economic development and social progress, effectively promoting the construction of a harmonious society.
Over the years, through the joint efforts of our party and the people, our society has generally achieved a state of harmony. However, there are still many contradictions and issues that affect social harmony, mainly including: imbalances in urban-rural and regional economic and social development, increased population, resource and environmental pressures; prominent issues concerning the vital interests of the people in employment, social security, income distribution, education, healthcare, housing, production safety, and social stability; incomplete systems and mechanisms, inadequate democracy and rule of law; lack of integrity and moral decline among certain members of society, inadequate qualifications, abilities, and work style of some leading cadres to adapt to the new situation and tasks; corruption is still relatively serious in some fields; hostile forces' infiltration and sabotage activities endanger national security and social stability. The existence of these contradictions and issues shows that the task of building a harmonious socialist society in our country is still quite challenging. In the face of this challenging historical task, the 16th National Congress of the Party put forward "making society more harmonious" as one of the goals of building a well-off society in an all-around manner.
(2) Further systematic and theoretical development of the ideology of building a harmonious society
Since the 16th National Congress of the Party, our party's understanding of social harmony has deepened, and the position of building a socialist harmonious society in the overall layout of socialism with Chinese characteristics has become increasingly clear.
In November 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Party proposed the "six more" goals for building a well-off society in an all-around manner, one of which is "making society more harmonious". In September 2004, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) reviewed and approved the "Decision on Strengthening the Party's Governance Capability", which put forward the proposition of building a harmonious society and made continuous improvement of the ability to build a harmonious society one of the main tasks of strengthening the party's governance capability.
On February 19, 2005, Hu Jintao summarized the basic characteristics of a socialist harmonious society at a special seminar for senior officials at the provincial and ministerial levels on "enhancing the capability to build a socialist harmonious society". He pointed out: the socialist harmonious society we aim to build should be a society with democracy and the rule of law, fairness and justice, integrity and friendliness, full of vitality, stability and order, and harmonious coexistence between human and nature. Democracy and the rule of law mean fully promoting socialist democracy, implementing the basic strategy of ruling the country by law, and mobilizing positive factors in all aspects; fairness and justice mean properly coordinating the interests of various sectors of society, handling internal contradictions among the people and other social conflicts correctly, and effectively safeguarding and realizing social fairness and justice; integrity and friendliness mean mutual help and trustworthiness throughout society, equal friendship and harmony among all the people; full of vitality means respecting the desire for social progress, supporting creative activities, giving play to creative talents, and affirming creative achievements that benefit social progress; stability and order mean sound social organization and mechanisms, improved social management, good social order, people's well-being and stability; harmonious coexistence between human and nature means development, prosperity, and good ecological environment. Hu Jintao also emphasized that building a socialist harmonious society is organically integrated with the construction of material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization in socialism. They have inseparable and close connections, as well as their own special fields and laws. Building socialist material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization can provide a solid foundation for constructing a socialist harmonious society. Building a socialist harmonious society can also provide important conditions for the construction of socialist material civilization, political civilization, and spiritual civilization.
In October 2006, the 6th Plenary Session of the 16th Party Congress made the decision on several major issues concerning the construction of a socialist harmonious society (referred to as the "Decision"), which formed the guiding document for the construction of a socialist harmonious society. Starting from the importance and urgency of constructing a socialist harmonious society, the "Decision" first clarifies the nature and positioning of a socialist harmonious society. The socialist harmonious society we are building is not the "Great Harmony" imagined by some philosophers in our country's history, nor is it the "Utopia" portrayed by utopian socialists. Instead, it is a combination of Marxist ideas about social harmony and the actual conditions in contemporary China. The "Decision" points out that the socialist harmonious society we want to build is a society that is led by the Communist Party of China and enjoyed by the entire people, constructed on the socialist path with Chinese characteristics. This clarifies the leadership core, development path, main practices, and fundamental purpose of building a socialist harmonious society.
To construct a socialist harmonious society, it is necessary to have correct guiding ideologies. The "Decision" emphasizes the need to adhere to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of the "Three Represents." It also stresses the need to adhere to the Party's basic line, basic principles, and basic experiences, to be guided by the scientific outlook on development in overall economic and social development, and to follow the general requirements of democracy and the rule of law, fairness and justice, integrity and friendship, vitality and stability, and harmonious coexistence between man and nature. The focus should be on addressing the most pressing, direct, and realistic interests of the people, focusing on the development of social undertakings, promoting social fairness and justice, building a harmonious culture, improving social management, enhancing social creativity, and following the path of common prosperity. This will promote the coordinated development of social construction and economic construction, political construction, and cultural construction.
(3) The goals, main tasks, and basic principles of constructing a socialist harmonious society
In accordance with the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way established at the 16th Party Congress, and based on the general requirements for constructing a socialist harmonious society, the "Decision" puts forward the goals and main tasks of building a socialist harmonious society by 2020. These include improving the socialist democratic legal system, fully implementing the basic strategy of governing the country by law, and effectively respecting and guaranteeing people's rights and interests; gradually reversing the trend of widening gaps in urban-rural and regional development, forming a reasonable and orderly income distribution pattern, increasing household wealth, and improving people's living standards; achieving relatively sufficient employment and establishing a basic social security system covering urban and rural residents; strengthening the basic public service system, significantly improving government management and service levels; significantly improving the overall quality of the nation's ethical, scientific, and cultural qualities and health; further fostering good moral standards and harmonious interpersonal relationships throughout society; significantly enhancing the creativity of the whole society and establishing an innovative country; improving the social management system and maintaining good social order; significantly improving resource utilization efficiency, and obviously improving the ecological environment; striving to achieve the goal of building a well-off society that benefits over a billion people at a higher level, and working towards a situation where all people can give full play to their abilities, receive due rewards, and live in harmony. 
To construct a socialist harmonious society, it is necessary to follow the correct principles. The "Decision" puts forward the "six must adhere to" principles: (1) adhere to people-centered development; (2) adhere to scientific development; (3) adhere to reform and opening-up; (4) adhere to democratic rule of law; (5) adhere to correctly handle the relationships between reform, development, stability; and (6) adhere to the joint construction of the whole society under the leadership of the Party.
3. Preliminary clarification of the overall layout ideas for socialist construction
The proposal of the strategic tasks for building a socialist harmonious society has made the overall layout of China's socialist cause more clearly structured, evolving from the development of the socialist economy, political construction, and cultural construction, to the development of socialist economy, political construction, cultural construction, and social construction, forming a four-pronged structure. Taken together, it is not difficult to see that: regarding the construction of socialist politics, the main focus is on solving the basic political structure of Chinese socialism, continuously improving the socialist political system, and gradually embodying scientific, rational, and effective political governance; regarding the construction of socialist economics, the main focus is on gradually establishing the basic economic system of socialism, in order to solve the problems of driving force and efficiency in the development of socialist society, thus laying a solid material foundation for the consolidation of socialism; regarding the construction of socialist culture, the main focus is on forming the core values and healthy and progressive humanistic concepts of socialism, constructing a scientific and advanced socialist ideological theory and social cultural atmosphere, in order to create a good humanistic environment for the better development of socialism; the construction of a socialist harmonious society is aimed at better addressing the overall layout of socialist modernization, while promoting political development, economic development, and cultural development, with a focus on solving the historical issue of social progress. The introduction of the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Development layout further enriches the theory of Chinese socialism in terms of social dynamics, social development, and social progress, becoming an inherent part of the cause of Chinese socialism and clarifying the social values and development goals of socialism. It not only innovates the balance mechanism of socialist society but also develops the driving mechanism of socialist society. Therefore, the introduction of this ideology not only highlights the tasks of social construction, makes the overall layout of socialist modernization in China more rational, but also makes the development model of Chinese socialism clearer.
The strategic concept of constructing a socialist harmonious society conforms to the basic principles of Marxism and the scientific vision of Marxist socialist society, marking a new advancement of our party in the theoretical and practical aspects of socialist social construction. It is not only a summary of the party's governing experience, but also a reference to the governing experience and lessons of some ruling parties abroad; it deepens our understanding of the law of socialist construction in China, as well as the law of the Communist Party's governance, the law of socialist construction, and the law of human social development; it enriches and develops the theory of Chinese socialism with distinctive features and enriches and develops the theory of socialist construction in Marxism.
III. Deepen the new deployment of administrative system reform and rural reform
From February 25th to 27th, 2008, the Second Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. The plenary session reviewed and approved the "Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Administrative Management System" and the "Plan for the Reform of the State Council Institutions" proposed on the basis of extensive consultations, and agreed to submit the "Plan for the Reform of the State Council Institutions" to the First Session of the 11th National People's Congress for deliberation.
1. Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Administrative Management System
The Central Committee of the Party and the State Council have always attached great importance to the reform of the administrative management system. Since the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, especially since the reform and opening up, the reform of the administrative management system has been continuously promoted, the construction of the government itself has been strengthened, and remarkable achievements have been made. Overall, China's administrative management system basically meets the requirements of economic and social development and effectively guarantees the development of the cause of reform and opening up and socialist modernization. However, in the face of new situations, new tasks, and new requirements for the administrative management system, the existing system still has some aspects that are not adapted: the transformation of government functions is not yet in place, there is excessive intervention in the microeconomic operation, and social management and public services are still relatively weak; there are still prominent problems such as cross-cutting of departmental responsibilities, disjointed rights and responsibilities, and low efficiency; the government's organizational structure is not entirely reasonable, and the administrative operation and management system is not sound enough; the supervision and restraint mechanism for administrative power is not yet perfect, and phenomena such as abuse of power, pursuit of personal gain, and corruption still exist. These problems directly affect the government's comprehensive and correct performance of its functions and to some extent restrict economic and social development. It is imperative to deepen the reform of the administrative management system.
(1) The goal and requirements of deepening the reform of the administrative management system. Regarding the overall goals of deepening the reform of the administrative management system, the "Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Administrative Management System" explicitly states: by 2020, a relatively sound socialist administrative management system with Chinese characteristics should be established... Through reforms, the fundamental transformation of government functions is realized, shifting towards creating a favorable development environment, providing high-quality public services, and maintaining social fairness and justice. It aims to achieve the fundamental transformation of government organization and personnel establishment towards scientification, standardization, and legalization. It also aims to achieve the fundamental transformation of administrative operation mechanisms and government management methods towards standardization, transparency, convenience, and efficiency, with the goal of constructing a government that satisfies the people.
(2) The core of deepening the reform of the administrative management system is to accelerate the transformation of government functions. The functions of government departments should be defined reasonably, and departmental responsibilities should be clarified to ensure consistency between power and responsibility. The division of responsibilities among departments should be rationalized, with one department primarily responsible for each matter, and if multiple departments are needed, the leading department should be identified to differentiate primary and secondary responsibilities. Mechanisms for coordination and cooperation between departments should be strengthened. Efforts should be made to accelerate the separation of government and enterprises, government and capital, government and intermediary organizations in the market, transferring matters that should not be managed by the government, and effectively managing matters that should be. This is to better leverage the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation and enhance the role of citizens and social organizations in the management of social public affairs, thus providing public goods more effectively.
(3) Explorations into departmental reform and the improvement of administrative operation mechanisms should be carried out. The reform of government institutions should primarily adhere to the principles of streamlining, unification, and effectiveness, ensuring mutual constraints and coordination among decision-making power, executive power, and supervisory power. Focusing on the transformation of functions and the rationalization of responsibilities, further optimization of government organizational structure and standardization of institutions should be conducted, and the establishment of a large department system with organic unification of functions should be explored. The administrative operation mechanisms should be improved as well.
(4) Strengthening the administration according to law and system construction is essential. Strict adherence to the rule of law in administration should be enforced. The exercise of power, handling of affairs, and managing of personnel should be carried out through institutional means. A sound supervisory mechanism should be established, and accountability should be strengthened. The principle of "power comes with responsibility," "supervision accompanies power exercise," and "violations shall be pursued" should be effectively implemented. Efforts should be made to expedite the construction of a rule of law government, implement government performance management and administrative accountability systems, and improve the supervision system for administrative power. The construction of the civil service team should also be strengthened.
2. State Council's Institutional Reform Plan
Based on the spirit of the 17th National Congress and the 2nd Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee, the main task of this round of State Council institutional reform is to focus on the transformation of government functions and the rationalization of departmental responsibilities. It aims to explore the establishment of a large department system with organic unification of functions, allocate macro-control department functions reasonably, strengthen energy and environmental management institutions, integrate and improve the industrial and informatization, transportation management systems, and prioritize improving people's livelihood. It also aims to strengthen and integrate social management and public service departments.
(1) Rational allocation of macro-control department functions is important. The National Development and Reform Commission should further transform its functions, reduce micromanagement and specific approval matters, and focus on macro-control. The Ministry of Finance should reform and improve budget and tax administration, establish a financial system that matches central and local fiscal powers and responsibilities, and improve the public finance system. The People's Bank of China should further improve the monetary policy system, coordinate and coordinate with financial regulatory departments, and safeguard national financial security. The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and other departments should establish a sound coordination mechanism to create a more complete macro-control system.
(2) Strengthening energy management institutions. Establish a high-level coordinating body, the National Energy Commission. Establish the National Energy Administration, to be managed by the National Development and Reform Commission. Integrate the energy industry management responsibilities and institutions of the National Development and Reform Commission, the responsibilities of the office of the National Energy Leading Group, and the nuclear power management responsibilities of the National Defense Science and Technology Industry Committee into the National Energy Administration. The work of the office of the National Energy Commission will be undertaken by the National Energy Administration. The National Energy Leading Group and its institutions will no longer be retained.
(3) Establish the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Integrate the industrial sector management responsibilities of the National Development and Reform Commission, the responsibilities other than nuclear power management of the National Defense Science and Technology Industry Committee, the responsibilities of the Ministry of Information Industry, and the responsibilities of the State Council Informationization Work Office into the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Establish the National Defense Science and Technology Industry Bureau, to be managed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration will be managed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The National Defense Science and Technology Industry Committee, the Ministry of Information Industry, and the State Council Informationization Work Office will no longer be retained.
(4) Establish the Ministry of Transport. Integrate the responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the urban passenger transport responsibilities guided by the Ministry of Construction, into the Ministry of Transport. Establish the Civil Aviation Administration of China, to be managed by the Ministry of Transport. The State Postal Administration will be managed by the Ministry of Transport. The Ministry of Railways will be retained to continue reforms. The Ministry of Transport and the Civil Aviation Administration of China will no longer be retained.
(5) Establish the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. Integrate the responsibilities of the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security into the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. Establish the National Civil Service Bureau, to be managed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. The Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security will no longer be retained.
(6) Establish the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The National Environmental Protection Administration will no longer be retained.
(7) The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development will be established. The Ministry of Construction will no longer be retained.
(8) The State Food and Drug Administration will be managed by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will be responsible for comprehensive coordination of food safety and organizing investigations into major food safety incidents.
3. Five major changes in the administrative management system
The reform of China's administrative management system, as an important part of national reform, will bring about five changes.
First, there is a change in the government's management philosophy, with administrative principles shifting towards a scientific approach. There is a further shift from the management principles of a planned economy to those of a socialist market economy. The change in principles is specifically reflected in: changing the notion that state-owned economy is the sole form of socialism and its essential attribute, with the government shifting from solely serving the state-owned economy to serving all economic components that contribute to the development of productive forces; changing the notion that development is purely economic development, with the government shifting from focusing on achieving high growth rates to promoting the improvement of economic quality, efficiency, and the comprehensive coordinated development of the economy and society. This change has led to a series of adjustments and reforms in the system and policies.
Second, there is a change in the scope of management, with government functions gradually becoming more rationalized. Through the separation of government and enterprises, reforms in the management of state-owned assets, and adjustments in the layout of the state-owned economy, the government has shifted from comprehensive management to primarily engaging in economic regulation, market supervision, social management, and public services; it has moved from directly engaging in and intervening in economic activities to effectively implementing macroeconomic regulation and creating a market environment; and it has shifted from pursuing purely high economic growth to promoting a combination of speed, quality, structure, and efficiency in order to drive coordinated development of the economy and society and achieve harmony between humans and nature.
Third, there is a change in administrative methods, with continuous improvement in management approaches. The reform of the administrative approval system has been promoted, resulting in significant reductions in the number of approval matters at the central and provincial levels. New approval methods, such as approval and registration, have been adopted to standardize and simplify approval procedures, and "one-stop" approval services and online approvals have been provided.
The fourth change is the transformation of the administrative foundation, with government actions becoming increasingly standardized. Since the reform and opening up, there have been six government institutional reforms of varying intensities, strengthening institutions involved in economic regulation, supervision, and social management services. This has reduced the overlapping responsibilities between departments, streamlined the number of government personnel, and promoted the transformation of government functions and the improvement of efficiency.
The fifth change is the improvement of the qualities of officials, with enhanced administrative capabilities. The establishment of a strict selection and recruitment mechanism for administrative personnel or civil servants requires all staff entering state administrative agencies to pass an examination. A scientific mechanism for selecting and appointing leading cadres has been established, promoting systems such as open selection and competitive appointment. The "Civil Servant Law of the People's Republic of China" promulgated in 2005 has become an important milestone in the institutionalization of civil servant construction and management.
4. Deployment of deepening rural reforms:
From October 9th to 12th, 2008, the Third Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. Starting from the new requirements proposed by the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China for achieving the goal of comprehensive construction of a well-off society, the plenary session made comprehensive arrangements for further deepening rural reforms.

It has significant and far-reaching implications for accelerating the promotion of socialist new rural construction and promoting the coordinated development of urban and rural areas.
IV. Summary of 30 years of reform and opening up and deep implementation of the scientific outlook on development
Just when the Party Central Committee, led by General Secretary Hu Jintao, was leading the whole Party and the people of the nation in their efforts to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects, China ushered in the 30th anniversary of reform and opening up. Over the past 30 years, the Party has always taken reform and opening up as a powerful driving force. Building on the foundation laid in the 29 years since the founding of New China, it has opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and has achieved remarkable accomplishments in various undertakings.
On December 18, 2008, General Secretary Hu Jintao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, made a scientific summary of the achievements and basic experiences of the past 30 years of reform and opening up. The achievements of these 30 years can be summed up as follows: actively promoting various institutional reforms and successfully achieving a historical transition from a highly centralized planned economic system to a vibrant socialist market economy system; continuously expanding opening-up and successfully achieving a historical transition from closed or semi-closed to all-round opening-up; insisting on economic construction as the center and comprehensively raising national strength to a new level; focusing on guaranteeing and improving people's well-being, with overall improvement of people's lives reaching a moderately prosperous level; vigorously developing socialist democracy, better safeguarding the people's right to be masters of their own country; vigorously developing advanced socialist culture, better satisfying the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people; vigorously developing social undertakings, consolidating and developing social harmony and stability; adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and making significant achievements in national defense and military construction; successfully implementing the basic principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and taking a major step forward in peaceful reunification of the motherland; persisting in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and making significant achievements in all-round diplomacy; persisting in the Party's self-governance, and significantly improving the Party's leadership level and governance capacity, in resisting corruption and preventing changes and in resisting risks.
Thirty years of practice have fully demonstrated that through the baptism of this great revolution of reform and opening up, the Chinese nation has caught up with the trend of the times, and socialist China stands proudly in the East of the world. The Communist Party of China stands at the forefront of the times.
Over the past 30 years, the fundamental reason why our country has achieved such splendid achievements and historic progress lies in integrating the basic principles of Marxism with China's specific realities, charting its own course, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Through creative practice over the past 30 years of reform and opening up, valuable experience has been accumulated. This is expounded in the 17th National Congress of the Party with the "Ten Combinations":
First, combining adherence to the basic principles of Marxism with promoting the sinification of Marxism. It is necessary to adhere to the basic principles of Marxism, and promote the sinification of Marxism in accordance with the practice and development of contemporary China, so as to better guide the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and inject vitality into contemporary Chinese Marxism.
Second, combine the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles with the promotion of reform and opening up. This means not only ensuring that reform and opening up are guided by the Four Cardinal Principles, but also giving the Four Cardinal Principles new significance in the context of reform and opening up. It requires providing education and guidance to the entire Party and all ethnic groups in China to deeply understand the dialectical relationship and important significance of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and promoting reform and opening up. It also means integrating the focus on economic development with the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles and the promotion of reform and opening up, in order to unite the two basic points of putting economic construction at the center and practicing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Third, combine the respect for the creative spirit of the people with the strengthening and improvement of Party leadership. This means not only adhering to the scientific principle of Marxist theory that the people create history, but also sincerely representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people and relying closely on the people. It requires mobilizing the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the people to the greatest extent possible, uniting strength and drawing wisdom from the people, continuously strengthening and improving Party leadership, and gaining the full trust and support of the people to fulfill its role as the core leadership.
Fourth, combine the adherence to the basic socialist system with the development of a market economy. This means continuing to adhere to the basic socialist system in the face of profound and extensive changes, while also developing a market economy under socialist conditions. It requires following the requirements of economic activities in accordance with the law of value, continuously liberating and developing productive forces, enhancing overall national strength, improving people's living standards, and better realizing the central task of economic construction.
Fifth, combine the promotion of changes in the economic foundation with the reform of the superstructure. This means actively promoting both economic system reform and political system reform, developing socialist democracy, constructing a socialist rule of law country, ensuring that the people are the masters of the country, continuously promoting the organic integration of the socialist superstructure with the economic foundation, and providing institutional guarantees and legal guarantees for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization construction.
Sixth, combine the development of social productive forces with the improvement of the overall cultural quality of the people. This means attaching importance to both material development, namely the development of social productive forces, and the development of people, namely the improvement of the overall cultural quality of all ethnic groups. It requires grasping both material civilization and spiritual civilization, vigorously developing socialist culture, constructing socialist spiritual civilization, vigorously cultivating citizens with ideals, morals, culture, and discipline, and providing powerful spiritual motivation and intellectual support for economic and social development.
Seventh, combine the improvement of efficiency with the promotion of social fairness. This means attaching great importance to promoting development through improving efficiency, and also attaching great importance to promoting social harmony through achieving social fairness on the basis of economic development. It requires putting people first, focusing on solving issues that are most concerning, most direct, and most immediate to the people, vigorously developing social undertakings, improving the income distribution system, ensuring and improving people's livelihood, and pursuing the path of common prosperity, and striving to create a situation where all the people can fully exert their abilities, obtain what they deserve, and live in harmony.
Eighth, combine the adherence to independence and self-reliance with participation in economic globalization. This means highly cherishing and firmly safeguarding the right to independence and self-reliance that the Chinese people have obtained through years of struggle, while also adhering to the basic national policy of opening up, always examining the development of China and the world from the perspective of the interrelationship between the international situation and the domestic situation, reflecting on and formulating China's development strategy, adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace, adhering to the path of peaceful development, adhering to an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, and promoting the building of a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity.
Ninth, combine the promotion of reform and development with the maintenance of social stability. This means vigorously promoting reform and development, while correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability, and adhering to the principles that reform is the driving force, development is the goal, and stability is the prerequisite. It requires coordinating the intensity of reform, the speed of development, and the capacity of society to bear, and taking the improvement of people's lives as an important link in dealing with the relationship between reform, development, and stability, promoting reform and development through social stability, and promoting social stability through reform and development.
The "Ten Combinations" combines the promotion of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics with the promotion of the new great project of party building. It focuses on promoting the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics by strengthening and improving party building. It continuously improves the party's governance capacity, maintains and develops the party's advanced nature, continuously enhances the party's class and mass foundation, continuously improves its ability to resist corruption and risks, and ensures that the party always remains a strong leadership core for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
These "Ten Combinations" are a new summary that is full of the spirit of the times. In summary, it creatively explores and answers major theoretical and practical questions such as what is Marxism and how to treat Marxism, what is socialism and how to build socialism, what kind of party to build and how to build it, what kind of development to achieve and how to achieve it. One important feature is the "combination" concept that reflects the second historic leap, combining the basic principles of Marxism with the practice and characteristics of contemporary China. The "Ten Combinations" are precious experiences for a large country like China with a population of over a billion, to overcome poverty, accelerate modernization, and consolidate and develop socialism. They are also valuable spiritual wealth accumulated by the Party and the people through long-term practice and arduous exploration. Hu Jintao's historic summary of the 30 years of reform and opening up is innovative, profound, rich in content, highly theoretical, strategic, and guiding. It shines with the brilliance of Marxist truth, further enriches the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and serves as a guiding document for the continued advancement of China's great cause of reform and opening up.
By drawing on and adhering to these valuable experiences, we can continuously enrich and develop them in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must adhere to liberating our minds, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, daring to reform, daring to innovate, never becoming rigid, never stagnating, fearless of any risks or distractions. The development and innovation of the ideological guidance of the Communist Party of China will achieve even greater achievements.
By summarizing the historical experience since the Communist Party of China came to power and since the reform and opening up, the Communist Party of China has taken a big step forward in the path of Marxist sinicization. On the other hand, the new development of Marxist sinicization also promotes the Communist Party of China to continuously form new understandings of the laws of China's reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction.
New understandings come from new practices. During the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" period, facing complex domestic and international situations and a series of major risks and challenges, the Communist Party of China has united and led people of all ethnic groups in the country to comprehensively promote reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction, resulting in historic changes in the national landscape. China's productivity and comprehensive national strength have significantly improved, social undertakings have accelerated development, people's lives have improved significantly, reform and opening up has made significant progress, and international status and influence have significantly increased. Major breakthroughs have been made in cutting-edge technologies such as manned spaceflight, lunar exploration projects, and supercomputers, and major achievements have been made in national defense and military modernization. All these achievements have been made under difficult conditions such as the impact of the international financial crisis and frequent natural disasters such as the Wenchuan and Yushu earthquakes and the Zhouqu flash floods and debris flows. Based on the summary of the achievements and experiences mentioned above, in October 2010, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) passed the "Suggestions on formulating the 12th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development". It explicitly stated that the guiding ideology for formulating the 12th Five-Year Plan is to hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents", thoroughly implement the Scientific Outlook on Development, adapt to new changes in domestic and international situations, respond to the new expectations of people of all ethnic groups for a better life, take scientific development as the theme, accelerate the transformation of economic development patterns as the main line, deepen reform and opening up, ensure and improve people's well-being, consolidate and expand the achievements in responding to the impact of the international financial crisis, promote long-term, stable and rapid economic development and social harmony and stability, and lay a decisive foundation for the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society. In March 2011, the Fourth Session of the 11th National People's Congress reviewed and approved the "Outline of the 12th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China". The outline, approved by the Congress, holds high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents", thoroughly implements the Scientific Outlook on Development, insists on strategic adjustment of economic structure as the main focus of accelerating the transformation of economic development patterns, insists on ensuring and improving people's well-being as the fundamental starting point and foothold for accelerating the transformation of economic development patterns, insists on building a resource-saving and environment-friendly society as the important focus of accelerating the transformation of economic development patterns, and insists on reform and opening up as the powerful driving force for accelerating the transformation of economic development patterns. It has clearly defined the main objectives of China's economic and social development during the 12th Five-Year Plan period and outlined the development blueprint for the next five years. The outline also specifically determines the main objectives of China's economic and social development in the next five years. These objectives not only combine the five-year plan with the ten-year plan, the present with the long-term, but also closely connect with the goal of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society, and comprehensively consider future development trends and conditions.
Looking at the 12th Five-Year Plan, the magnificent blueprint inspires people, and the grand goals drive people forward. The action plan formulated by the CPC Central Committee, with its realistic and inspiring tone, vividly outlines the roadmap for the third five-year plan of the new century, pointing out the direction for China's future development and filling the people of all ethnic groups in the country with hope for socialist China's future.
