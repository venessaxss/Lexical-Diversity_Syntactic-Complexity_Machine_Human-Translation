Chapter One: The dissemination of Marxism and the Party's guiding ideology.
Section 1: The initial years of Marxism in China.
I. Unprecedented cultural awakening in the Chinese intellectual community.
The 20th century was a century of great changes in modern Chinese society...
Chinese people entered the 20th century with the national humiliation of the Eight-Nation Alliance occupying the capital, Beijing. At that time, the outlook for the Chinese nation seemed bleak, on the brink of destruction.
Since the Opium War in 1840, foreign capitalist forces invaded China, leading to significant changes within Chinese society and the gradual transformation into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Imperialists employed military, political, economic, and cultural means to invade China in order to subjugate and destroy it. China's feudal rulers, in their efforts to maintain their own power, did not hesitate to align themselves with imperialism and became agents of Western powers.
The 1911 Xinhai Revolution, led by Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the autocratic monarchy system that had ruled China for thousands of years, initiating a modern national democratic revolution in the truest sense. This opened the gate for progress in China but failed to change the social nature of old China and the plight of its people. After Yuan Shikai seized power as the President of the Republic, the political environment in China deteriorated even further. He completely eliminated the democratic gains achieved in the Xinhai Revolution and shamelessly staged a play to restore imperial rule. After Yuan's downfall, China fell into a state of warlordism and chaos. Manipulated by imperialism, the warlords pursued "military unification" under the guise of "protecting the nation and its people," but in reality, they were merely seeking power and oppressing the people. The continuous warfare among the warlords brought severe destruction and endless calamities to society and the people's lives. Around 1915, China experienced several major famines, deepening the suffering of the people.
Imperialist aggression also forced China to gradually adopt a capitalist mode of production. Starting from the 1860s, China developed its own national industry. After the First Sino-Japanese War, China's national economy experienced significant growth. From 1895 to 1913, 548 new factories and mines were established nationwide, with a total capital of 120,297,000 yuan, among which 463 were fully commercial enterprises with a total capital of 90,821,000 yuan. Along with the development of China's national economy, the Chinese proletariat also grew and expanded. In 1894, there were approximately 100,000 modern industrial workers in China, and by the eve of World War I in 1914, this number had increased to over one million. This indicates that although imperialism profited in China, it also fostered revolutionary forces opposing it.
The two parallel trends of national oppression and the rise and fall of modern industry constitute the overall movement of Chinese society in modern times. The combination of imperialism and feudal forces pushed China into a dark abyss, while the emergence of national industry and new social forces brought a bright future to China. Looking back at the 110-year history of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the beginning of the 20th century (1901-1915) can be described as the lowest point of China's decline.
The First World War accelerated the evolution of Chinese society and triggered an unprecedented cultural awakening in the intellectual sphere.
During the war, on September 15, 1915, Chen Duxiu founded the "Youth Magazine" in Shanghai (which was later renamed "New Youth" starting from volume 2, issue 1). Using evolutionism as a weapon, he launched a new cultural movement that targeted Confucianism and opposed old traditions. The thoughts of the new cultural advocates were extremely radical, rejecting traditional authority and various dogmas, and demanding the breaking of mental chains and the use of "rationality" to criticize and examine everything. This cultural movement was commonly referred to as the "May Fourth Movement". Compared to the Enlightenment movement in the West since the 15th century, it had consistency in nature and content, namely, it was a critique of feudal ideology and culture, paving the way for the development of capitalism. However, there were some differences between the two movements in terms of timing. The Western Enlightenment movement prepared thoughts for the outbreak of the European bourgeois revolution, while the Chinese New Culture Movement conducted ideological education after the outbreak of the bourgeois revolution. It erupted against the background of the Great War of imperialism in the world and the internal warlord strife in China, inevitably strengthening the resistance of the initiators against imperialism and feudalism, thereby giving this movement new historical content to a certain extent, and preparing the ideological prerequisites and necessary conditions for the later spread of Marxism in China and the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement.
The war also exposed the shortcomings of Western civilization and destroyed the idols in the minds of the Chinese people. The brutal war not only led to the deaths of over ten million people on the battlefield and left more than twenty million people injured and disabled, but also almost completely annihilated the accumulated material civilization within a few short years. Liang Qichao arrived in Europe shortly after the war ended and traveled to countries such as Britain, France, and Belgium. In "Imprint of Heart and Shadow during My European Travels," he described the scenes of production destruction, crises of faith, social chaos, and the poverty of the people that appeared in Europe, lamenting that "the hearts of the entire society there are enveloped in doubt, dullness, and fear, as if a sailing ship that lost its compass encountered wind and fog, unsure of its future." This situation couldn't help but shock the Chinese people who had been enthusiastic about studying the West.
It was precisely at this time that many progressive individuals had already realized that Chinese society needed to be transformed, and it must be transformed in a direction completely different from Western capitalism. Liang Qichao concluded after traveling in Europe that social revolution was probably the unique feature of the 20th century, and no country could escape from it, although it was just a matter of sooner or later. After analyzing the various evils of capitalism, Zheng Zhenduo came to the conclusion that "there is no room for a society under the domination of capitalism." The ideas of the advanced intellectuals in China started to undergo profound changes, from longing for Western parliamentary democracy to disappointment, and from pursuing capitalism to negating it. The magazine "Minxing" at that time wrote, "Republican democratic politics is not our end goal, a world revolution is inevitable."
Idols in their minds had collapsed, but the journey still had to continue. In the ever-changing global political landscape, the First World War and the October Revolution in Russia brought about new changes in the world, prompting a group of Chinese people concerned about the future and fate of their homeland to start exploring new plans for social transformation.
At this time, Marxism caught the attention of progressive Chinese individuals and triggered a wave of socialist propaganda. At that time, among the hundreds of publications advocating "social transformation," the majority expressed varying degrees of favor and longing for socialism. Many publications had one or several articles specifically introducing and promoting socialism in almost every issue. In these articles, some young people hailed socialism as the "fortune of mankind" and believed that in China, "if there is no construction, there must be construction based on the principles of socialism," and socialism is the "common ideal of present and future humanity."
Socialism became the most popular thing, but it should be acknowledged that during this period, the content of "socialism" discussed by people was quite diverse. Apart from Marx's scientific socialism, it also included various branches called "socialism" at that time: Stirner's "individualist anarchism," Proudhon's "social anarchism," Bakunin's "collectivist anarchism," Kropotkin's "mutualism," and Muroya Shusaku's "new villageism," among others. However, one thing is certain: the widespread dissemination of socialist ideas in China during this period was strongly influenced by the post-World War I capitalist crisis in the West. When the monthly magazine "Communist" was founded in Shanghai in 1920, it pointed out, "Economic transformation naturally occupies a primary position in human transformation. Apart from capitalism and socialism, we have no other way of production. Capitalism in Europe and America has already developed and tended to collapse... and socialism's mode of production naturally takes its place."
The ideal socialist society is longing, but what is this society like and how can it be achieved? Just at this time, news of the victory of the October Revolution in Russia reached China. The victory of the October Revolution led by Lenin turned socialism from a theoretical study in books into a vivid reality. And Marxism is the ideological weapon for this transformation. After the October Revolution, Russia went through civil war and armed intervention from foreign countries, but still stood firm on the world stage and demonstrated vitality, forming a sharp contrast with the declining Western capitalism. As a result, advanced Chinese intellectuals began to shift their focus to Soviet Russia and Marxism.
II. The spread of Marxism in China
The Chinese had early contact with Marx and his doctrine. From September 1902 to 1906, Liang Qichao published multiple articles in the "New Citizen's Collection" introducing the outline of Marx and his doctrine. Zhu Zhixian, a bourgeoisie revolutionary democrat, published an article titled "Biography of German Social Revolutionary" in the second issue of "Minpao" in November 1905, introducing the life and doctrine of Marx and Engels. In addition, Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren, Liao Zhongkai, and others mentioned Marx's doctrine in their speeches or writings. Some anarchists also mentioned Marx and Engels' names in their publications and translated excerpts from their works. However, these introductions were fragmentary, scattered, and some were even misinterpreted, and the introducers did not adhere to Marxism, with some even holding a critical attitude.These introductions did not and could not have a significant impact on the social changes in China at that time. It was not until the May Fourth period, under the propaganda and agitation of Chinese new intellectuals, that the introduction of Marxism became an unstoppable ideological trend.
Among the propagators of Marxism during the May Fourth period, the most influential were Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu. Whether in terms of ideology or politics, they both influenced a generation of Chinese people.
Li Dazhao was the first person to disseminate Marxism in China and played a leading role in the early Marxist dissemination movement. From July to November 1918, he published articles such as "Comparative Views on the French and Russian Revolutions," "The Victory of the Commoners," and "The Victory of Bolshevism," promoting the value and significance of the October Revolution with a profound historical perspective. After the May Fourth Movement, he compiled the six-volume fifth issue of "New Youth," which he edited, into "Marxist Research Journal" and published the article "My Marxist View," systematically expounding Marxist economic theory, materialist historiography, and socialist theory in China for the first time. Li Dazhao fully affirmed the historical position of Marxism, calling it the "doctrine of the world's transformative prime mover." He said that Marx's socialist theory can be roughly divided into three parts: the theory about the past, which is his theory of history, also known as the theory of social evolutionary organization; the theory about the present, which is his economic theory, also known as the economic theory of capitalism; the theory about the future, which is his policy theory, also known as the theory of socialist movement, that is, social democracy. "His doctrine is a completely self-sufficient, organic, and systematic organization." Among them, Marx's theory of history reveals the material motivations and class relations of social development, elucidates the theory of productive forces and relations of production, economic base and superstructure, and class and class struggle; Marx's economic theory expounds the theory of surplus labor and exposes "the secrets of modern capitalism" and "the production methods of capitalists exploiting labor," which is the fundamental concept of Marx's economic theory. Marx observes the economic conditions of modern society with the materialist historiography and the theory of surplus value. He analyzes and studies the economic organization of capitalism and foresees that the capitalist system will inevitably be replaced by a socialist system, and then asserts that "the means and methods of realizing socialism are still in the final stage of class competition." Therefore, Li Dazhao emphasized that Marx's "these three theories are inseparably related, and class competition is like a golden thread that fundamentally connects these three principles."
Afterward, Li Dazhao also published articles such as "Marx's Historical Philosophy," promoting the materialist historiography. He also taught courses on materialist historiography, socialism, and social movements at Peking University and Beijing Women's Normal School. In the Marxist theoretical system, he focused on propagating materialist historiography, fully reflecting the urgent need for theoretical guidance in solving Chinese problems.
Unlike Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu's conversion from a radical democrat to a Marxist came later in time. However, because Chen Duxiu served as the editor-in-chief of "New Youth" for a long time and had a certain reputation in the New Culture Movement, he quickly became the most influential propagator of Marxism in China. In March 1920, in his article "Malthusian Population Theory and the Population Problem in China," he began to encounter Marxist viewpoints and critiqued Malthus's theory to some extent while maintaining a reserved attitude toward Marx's materialist historiography. In his subsequent speech, "The Awakening of the Workers," Chen Duxiu already expressed the Marxist viewpoint of "labor creates the world" and "those who work with their hands are the most useful and valuable." He emphasized that the saying from ancient times, "those who work with their minds govern people, those who work with their hands are governed by people," should be reversed to say "those who work with their hands govern people, those who work with their minds are governed by people," which is the correct principle.
Of course, the real change in Chen Duxiu's thinking, that is, the shift from reviewing and approving to supporting and promoting socialism, began with the publication of the article "On Politics" in September 1920. In this article, Chen Duxiu criticizes the anarchist view of opposing politics, law, authority, and the state, pointing out that the root of world inequality lies in the existence of the bourgeoisie. He states, "To eliminate this inequality and suffering, only the oppressed laboring class can create a new force, stand in the position of the state, and use political and legal institutions to completely conquer the oppressive bourgeoisie, and then it can be expected to abolish the system of private property, wage labor, and other excessively unequal economic conditions". This shows his support for Marxism and his explicit agreement with the view that Marxism "uses revolutionary means to build a state for the laboring class (i.e., the productive class), create a political and legal system that prohibits all forms of plunder internally and externally, which is the primary need of modern society". Chen Duxiu had a sense of historical mission and idealistic pursuit to oppose warlords' rule and seek happiness for the people. As a revolutionary with a strong activist temperament, he had a special affinity for Marxist social revolution theory. He founded publications, organized groups, and wrote articles to expose the crimes of the capitalist system and promote socialist ideas, effectively promoting the dissemination of Marxism in China.
Compared with Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao's most prominent characteristic is his firm establishment of dialectical materialism, believing in the great role of the masses in the historical process and recognizing that the driving force of social development can only be found in the nature of the people themselves, not in any external force. It is based on this understanding that Li Dazhao emphasizes the connection between theory and practice and actively engages with the masses.
In addition to Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, Li Da, Yang Po'an, Li Hanjun, and others who studied and researched Marxism during their time in Japan also promoted and expanded the dissemination of Marxism through publishing articles and translating works. Li Da translated three books, "Interpretation of Historical Materialism," "Marxist Economics," and "General Overview of Social Issues," and sent them back to be published in China. Among them, "Marxist Economics" was listed as a study material by the Marxist Theory Research Association of Peking University led by Li Dazhao. After returning to China, Yang Po'an published articles such as "Socialism" and "Marxism... called scientific socialism" in the Guangdong edition of "China New Newspaper" from October to December 1919. The former praised Marx's "Capital" as a "socialist classic"; the latter systematically introduced Marxist dialectical materialism, class struggle theory, and surplus value theory. Li Hanjun translated and wrote about sixty articles related to Marxism during the period from 1919 to the founding of the CPC. Furthermore, Shao Piaoping, a Progressive Journalist, also made contributions to the dissemination of Marxism.
III. Controversies and Choices in the Dissemination of Marxism in China
During the May Fourth period, among those who introduced and studied Marxism, some not only believed that Marxism was the truth, but also considered it a weapon to transform China; some only saw it as a Western theory to explore and did not connect it with the actual situation in China; some studied it in order to prevent China from taking the path guided by Marxism. In terms of class attributes, Marxism is a doctrine pursued by the working class for liberation, and it will not be accepted by representatives of other classes. Therefore, the dissemination of Marxism in China, especially when early Marxist theorists in China connected it with the fate of China, inevitably sparked debates. Marxism opens up new territories in the struggle.
The first debate revolved around the cultural choices in China, specifically whether the solution to China's problems should be based on Marxism. In July 1919, Hu Shi, one of the advocates of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, published an article titled "Focus on Researching More Problems and Less on Talking About Ideologies". This sparked a heated debate in the intellectual sphere from July to September. Hu Shi's argument was based on empiricism. He believed that the biggest danger in the public sphere at the time was the inclination towards paper doctrines, without actually examining the social needs of China today. He emphasized that the primary duty of public intellectuals is to carefully investigate the actual situation of society. All theories and ideologies are merely tools for this examination. He strongly opposed the prevalent "empty talk ideology".
After Hu Shi's article was published, Li Dazhao and Lan Gongwu wrote articles expressing their objections. In the views of Li Dazhao and Lan Gongwu, all problems are intertwined in a comprehensive social structure, and the ideology aimed at solving problems needs to be tested through social experiments. They believed that people need to use ideology as a standard for judging situations and problems, as well as a tool for solving interconnected problems. Li Dazhao agreed with Hu Shi's viewpoint that actual problems should be seriously studied and not vaguely discussed through various doctrines. However, he did not think that there was a fundamental contradiction between studying problems and discussing ideologies. He pointed out that "the solution to a social problem requires the joint efforts of the majority in society", and in order for "a social problem to become a common issue for the majority in society", there must be a "common direction of ideals and ideologies". He stated that "our social movement, on the one hand, surely needs to study practical problems, but on the other hand, it needs to promote idealistic ideologies. These are mutually beneficial and not contradictory." At the same time, he also pointed out that the study of problems should be based on theory, and before studying various problems, the study of various ideologies is necessary. The debate between "problems and ideologies" was actually a discussion among progressive intellectuals at that time regarding the development of Chinese thought and the destiny of modern China's history. Hu Shi advised people to talk less about ideologies and advocated that China could solve its problems without undergoing profound revolution. Li Dazhao, on the other hand, pointed out that the popularity of Bolshevism was a major change in world culture, and the theory of class struggle was an essential part of the materialist view of history. If class struggle is not taken seriously and this theory is not used as a tool to guide the actual movement of workers' unity, then economic revolution may never be achieved. In this debate, Li Dazhao and young Marxists from various regions argued, based on the level of understanding at the time, that Marxism was suitable for China's needs. This had a positive effect on expanding the influence of Marxism.
The debate on "problems and ideologies" further aroused the intellectual community's contemplation of China's future. In September 1920, Zhang Dongfu published an article titled "Another Lesson Learned from Traveling Inland," in which he believed that there was only one way to save China, which was to increase wealth and develop industry. Later, he stated that the most efficient method of industrial development was capitalism. Early Marxists seriously criticized this argument, leading to a debate on the "socialist question" in the process of spreading Marxism.
In May 1921, Li Dazhao pointed out in the New Youth that China is the market of the world. The economic forces cultivated by various capitalist countries in China have already taken deep roots and are unbreakable. China, which is still very backward in industrial development, is under the heavy influence of various political and economic forces of other countries. If it wants to develop capitalism and engage in economic warfare with capitalist countries, it may end up in a disastrous state. In the debate with Zhang Dongpei and others, early Marxists compared and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of socialism and capitalism, effectively proposing the idea that only socialism can develop China's productivity. Li Dazhao pointed out, "To develop industry in China today, we must rely on a purely productive organization of the government to eliminate domestic exploiting classes and resist capitalism in this world, and we must rely on socialist organization to manage industry." Chen Duxiu also emphasized that to "enable the Chinese people to achieve a human standard of living, we must abolish the capitalist production system and adopt the socialist production system." "At this time, not only is it possible for us in China to talk about socialism, but it is also necessary to urgently promote socialism." This shows that taking the road of socialism was the common institutional choice expressed by early Chinese communists in the debates, and this institutional choice represents the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces.
The third debate was with the anarchists. In the May Fourth period, anarchism was widely spread among young intellectuals. It had certain positive significance in inspiring people's consciousness to oppose the monarchy and autocratic system. However, it started from extreme individualism, advocating absolute personal freedom, opposing any organization and discipline, opposing all authority, and advocating a state of anarchy and absolute egalitarianism, opposing Marxist state theory and proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, it became a major obstacle to the spread of Marxism. So, while the debate about socialism with Zhang Dongpei and others was still ongoing, another ideological confrontation with anarchists like Huang Lingshuang began. In the debate, The New Youth, Communist Party Monthly, and other publications published sharp criticisms of anarchism. The January 1922 issue of Pioneer, the publication of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, even made criticizing anarchism one of its important tasks.
Marxists mainly criticized anarchism in terms of the form of revolution, the nature of the state, and the necessity of proletarian dictatorship. On the one hand, they pointed out that the Chinese proletariat had long been suffering under the exploitation of imperialism and capitalists and had a strong demand for seizing state power through violent revolution. On the other hand, they also pointed out that only by establishing proletarian dictatorship could the interests of the workers be protected. Therefore, the feudal aristocracy and the bourgeoisie's state must be completely overthrown, while the state power of the proletariat must be consolidated and strengthened. This is the correct path from capitalism to communism. In addition, Marxists also criticized the anarchist idea of egalitarianism in distribution and refuted their fallacy of "absolute freedom," pointing out that freedom in human society is always relative and there is no such thing as "absolute freedom." This struggle to criticize anarchist thought was on a larger scale.
The debate between Marxists and non-Marxists was the first clash in the spread of Marxism and had significant and far-reaching influence in the field of Chinese thought. During the debate, the early Marxists, with their unwavering faith, bravely wielded the theoretical weapon of Marxism to critique various erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie and petite bourgeoisie. A group of progressive youth who saw saving the country and the people as their duty and had the ambition to transform Chinese society, after this clash, initially felt the scientific and truthful nature of Marxism and realized that only scientific socialism can achieve the goal of saving the country and the people and fundamentally transforming Chinese society.In the process of establishing their own life beliefs and choosing which "ism" to transform Chinese society, they ultimately chose scientific socialism and transformed into Marxists, and quickly engaged in propagating Marxism, integrating with the working masses, and creating early organizations of the Communist Party of China.
Section 2: The Communist Party of China establishes the guiding position of Marxism
I. The struggle of early Marxists in China
After Chinese advanced intellectuals accepted Marxism, they immediately applied it to the study of China's problems and situation. This practical value orientation reflected the ideological condition of the Chinese intellectual community at that time. After the May Fourth Movement, the tide of social transformation ideology widely emerged. The "Study and Mutual Aid Society" established in 1919 had prominent figures such as Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and Cai Yuanpei as its initiators. This ideology promoted the young generation to step into society and led them to understand China's social life reality. At the same time, the debate with non-Marxist ideologies also drove the early Marxists in China to research practical issues. Not long after Hu Shi proposed the suggestion to "study more problems," many socialists and their followers began to engage with workers and farmers, studying their living conditions, while Hu Shi and his followers seldom participated in such social surveys and labor movements.
Li Dazhao made outstanding contributions to the development of a practical value orientation. Even before the May Fourth Movement, he published articles encouraging young people to unite with the masses and delve into China's social reality. Under Li Dazhao's influence, in March 1919, young students such as Deng Zhongxia organized the Peking University Popular Education Lecture Group, conducting organized education and propaganda activities among the masses. After the May Fourth Movement, Li Dazhao organized revolutionary figures in Beijing to deeply investigate the living conditions of rickshaw workers, while also sending Deng Zhongxia, Zhang Guozhu, and others to the Changxindian railway workers for propaganda, establishing labor remedial schools and worker clubs, and organizing workers. In March 1920, in addition to urban lectures, the Peking University Popular Education Lecture Group also went to factories and rural areas in Lugouqiao, Changxindian, Tongxian, and other places to give lectures, conduct social surveys, and understand the lower classes. They used holidays to form groups to lecture in factories and rural areas, covering topics such as "What is popular education" and "The spirit that citizens of the republic should have." Through these lecture activities, these young intellectuals initially observed the hardships of workers and farmers, the backwardness of education, and understood that rural people were more susceptible to understanding reasoning and easier to instill new ideas. Deng Zhongxia, in particular, gained experience through the lecture activities in Changxindian, laying the foundation for his future leadership in the workers' movement.
Another important method used by Marxists for practical purposes was to establish workers' remedial schools, night schools, literacy classes, and worker clubs. In this way, on one hand, the socialist ideas of scientific socialism could be instilled into the working masses, and core members could be discovered and cultivated among the workers, organizing the vast number of workers through them, laying the foundation for establishing labor unions and leading workers in struggles. On the other hand, it was also beneficial for Marxists to establish close connections with the working class and participate in their actual struggles. This method of establishing schools among workers was later frequently employed by the Party to lead the workers' movement. The May Day International Labor Day commemorative activities in 1920 marked an important beginning for Chinese Marxists to enter the workers' movement.They took the opportunity to promote the value of labor and the great role of the working class, exposed the evils of the capitalist system, and called for the unity of the working class to struggle. In Shanghai, Chen Duxiu personally participated in and guided seven industrial and labor organizations, including the Chinese Industrial Association and the Chinese Federation of Trade Unions, to form a joint conference and jointly launch preparations for the May Day commemoration assembly. At the commemoration assembly, the speakers talked about the sanctity of labor and the emotions of the people were high. The conference resolution is as follows: ① demand for an eight-hour workday; ② organize genuine labor unions; ③ unite workers in all industries. After the conference, the seven organizations issued a "Response to the Announcement of the Russian Labor and Peasant Government," proposing "We will strive to create a new, beautiful, and lasting peaceful human world, and we are determined to cooperate with you and share this responsibility."
At the same time, similar commemorative activities were also held in Beijing. On May 1st, Peking University suspended classes for a day, and more than 500 workers and students held a commemoration assembly at Peking University. Li Dazhao attended the meeting and delivered a speech. The Workers' Mutual Aid Corps traveled in two cars through the east and west districts. The banners flying in front of the cars had red characters such as "Sacred Labor" and "Long Live May 1st," and there were also red flags representing the revolutionary spirit, which attracted special attention. They shouted slogans of "Long Live Labor" while distributing leaflets with the "May 1st Beijing Labor Declaration" under the cars.
In addition to Shanghai and Beijing, workers and students in Tangshan, Harbin, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhangzhou, and other places also held commemorative activities. This was a large-scale movement that combined Marxism with the Chinese workers' movement. In this regard, Cai Hesen commented, "The propaganda for the first May 1st in China was significant, and the circulation of 'New Youth' reached ten thousand copies, so the impact at that time was considerable and had spread throughout the country."
Among the early Marxists, Mao Zedong was also a model who emphasized practicality and took practical actions.
As early as the autumn of 1919, he organized the Problem Study Society in Changsha. This society proposed to study issues related to politics, economics, society, education, labor, international affairs, etc., as well as issues such as how to unite the masses, the possibility of socialism, and issues related to Confucian teachings, totaling more than one hundred and forty. He often went deep into the middle of railway workers, construction workers, porters, and others to understand the situation and make friends, and also established workers' night schools and labor unions. In order to integrate with the workers, Mao Zedong often took off his long gown and put on a short jacket to mingle with the workers, learn their language, understand their requirements, and empathize with their lives.
The intellectuals who propagated Marxism were practical and went deep into the work of propaganda and organizing among workers and peasants, promoting the integration of Marxism with the Chinese workers' movement.At the same time, their thoughts and emotions also underwent changes and gradually developed into vanguard fighters with a communist consciousness. The working class and peasantry began to accept Marxism, from which a group of advanced individuals with communist ideals emerged. In China, the conditions for establishing a communist party have matured.
II. The establishment of the party and the establishment of the position of Marxism in the Chinese revolution
The spread and integration of Marxism with the Chinese workers' movement, as well as the emergence of a group of advanced individuals with communist ideals, naturally put the issue of organizing a political party for the Chinese working class on the agenda. Li Dazhao pointed out, "There is currently no organization that can truly represent the forces of the masses in China. If a strong and well-organized group can be established and pay attention to the training of its members, then China's thorough reform may have some support!" Cai Hesen clearly stated at the Mondaini Conference of the New Minority Study Society in France: the proletarian revolution movement must "first organize a party - the Communist Party," because the party is "the initiator, propagandist, vanguard, and operation headquarters of the revolutionary movement"; with the party, the revolutionary movement and labor movement can have a central nervous system. This indicates that there was already a consensus among the advanced individuals in China who had communist beliefs at that time.
Under the promotion of Li Dazhao, the Marxist Study Society of Peking University, established in March 1920, was the earliest group in China with the purpose of studying and researching Marxism. Its members were mostly students from Peking University, including Deng Zhongxia, Gao Junyu, Huang Rikui, Fan Hongjie, He Mengxiong, Li Jun, Zhu Wushan, Zhang Guozhu, Liu Renjing, Luo Zhanglong, etc. This was a combination of intellectuals who believed in Marxism, with the aim of establishing the Communist Party. It was precisely at this time that Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Vorovsky, the representative of the Communist International, came to China. His task was to understand the situation in China, establish contacts with progressive forces in China, and consider the possibility of establishing the Comintern Far Eastern Secretariat in Shanghai. After several meetings with Li Dazhao and others, he expressed his support and assistance for the work of establishing a communist party in China. Through Li Dazhao's introduction, Vorovsky arrived in Shanghai and met with Chen Duxiu. Based on his observations of Beijing and Shanghai, Vorovsky believed that the time for China to establish a party had already matured, and he suggested that Chen Duxiu organize the Chinese Communist Party. This coincided with Chen Duxiu's wishes. Chen Duxiu then introduced Vorovsky to Li Hanjun, the editor of the "Weekly Review" propagating socialism. After several discussions, it was decided to establish a secret group to prepare for the formal establishment of the party. In May of the same year, the Marxist Study Society was established in Shanghai, with Chen Duxiu as the leader and members including Li Hanjun, Shen Xuanlu, Shao Lizi, Chen Wangdao, Shi Cuntong, Yu Xiusong, Shen Yanbing, Yang Mingzhai, etc.
At the same time, in order to guide the party-building work in East Asia, the Communist International was also setting up the Far Eastern Secretariat in Shanghai, including departments for China, Korea, and Japan. With Vorovsky's efforts, "the work of the Chinese department progressed relatively smoothly. Relying on workers' and students' organizations, the department laid the foundation for communist organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and other places".In August 1920, initiated by Chen Duxiu, Li Hanjun, Shen Xuanlu, Chen Wangdao, Yu Xiusong, Shi Cuntong (then in Japan), Yang Mingzhai, and Li Da, the Shanghai Communist Party organization was officially established. As soon as this organization was formed, it took on the task of establishing the party throughout the country. Shortly after the establishment of the Shanghai party organization, Zhang Shenfu, a lecturer at Beijing Normal University, came to Shanghai to welcome British philosopher Russell for lectures and had extensive discussions on party building issues at Chen Duxiu's home. They believed that all those who could join the party should be absorbed into the party, and that Li Dazhao should establish a Communist Party organization in Beijing. In late September, Zhang Shenfu returned to Beijing with Chen Duxiu's opinions to discuss party building matters with Li Dazhao, and they unanimously agreed to immediately develop party members. At the beginning of October, Zhang Guozhu, who participated in the fundraising activities of the National Student Federation, returned to Beijing and conveyed Chen Duxiu's opinions on party building. As a result, Li Dazhao, Zhang Shenfu, and Zhang Guozhu officially established the Beijing Communist Party organization in Li Dazhao's office. The Beijing Communist Party organization was the main base in northern China for propagating Marxism and cultivating revolutionary talents.
Under the impetus of the Shanghai and Beijing party organizations, Communist Party organizations were established in various places one after another. From the autumn and winter of 1920 to the first half of 1921, Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, and others were in Wuhan; Chen Gongbo, Tan Pingshan, and others were in Guangzhou; Mao Zedong, He Shuheng, and others were in Changsha; Wang Jinmei, Deng Enming, and others were in Jinan; Shi Cuntong, Zhou Fohai, and others were in Japan; Zhang Shenfu, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Gongpei, Zhou Enlai, and others were in France. Early Communist Party organizations were established successively. The names of the early Communist Party organizations in China were not uniform. The organization in Shanghai was initially called the Chinese Communist Party, while the one in Beijing was referred to as the "Beijing Branch of the Chinese Communist Party". They later became local organizations that formed the unified Chinese Communist Party, commonly referred to as "Communist groups". Most of the members of these organizations were advanced intellectuals who had grown and developed through the May Fourth Movement. Their understanding of Marxism and their observations on China's practical issues were deeper than those of their contemporaries. These local Communist Party organizations mentioned above directly prepared for the formal establishment of the Chinese Communist Party.
The transition from decentralized to centralized Communist Party organizations and the establishment of a unified national Chinese Communist Party organization were also accomplished under the guidance of the Communist International. In June 1921, the Communist International sent Marin and Nicholski, secretaries of the Irkutsk Bureau of the Communist International, to Shanghai, suggesting that the National Congress of the Communist Party be convened as soon as possible to formally establish the Chinese Communist Party. Subsequently, Li Da issued a notice to party organizations nationwide, requiring each to select two representatives to attend the congress. On July 23, the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was formally held in Shanghai. Li Da, Li Hanjun, Zhang Guozhu, Liu Renjing, Mao Zedong, He Shuheng, Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, Wang Jinmei, Deng Enming, Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and Bao Huiseng, thirteen people, representing over fifty party members nationwide, attended the congress. Marin and Nicholski also participated in the meeting. Li Dazhao was unable to attend the congress due to an accident. Chen Duxiu did not attend the meeting, but he entrusted Bao Huiseng to present a manifesto stating that "the Communist Party should be based on democratic centralism, believe in communism, implement proletarian dictatorship, and practice communism" for discussion during the congress.
The Conference adopted the "First Manifesto of the Communist Party of China", which states: "This Party is named the Communist Party of China." The Party's manifesto includes: "overthrowing the political power of the capitalist class," "recognizing the dictatorship of the proletariat," "eliminating capitalist private ownership," and "joining the Third International." The essence of the Party manifesto is to carry out socialist revolution and replace capitalism with communism.
There was intense debate during the conference regarding the work arrangements after the Party's establishment. Li Hanjun and others believed that the Chinese proletariat was too immature and did not understand Marxism. They advocated for uniting with advanced intellectuals and engaging in the study and promotion of Marxism. However, the majority disagreed with this opinion and believed that the Party must concentrate its efforts on social struggle and engage in practical work. The First National Congress of the CPC decided to make the workers' movement the focal point of their work and made specific arrangements for various Party tasks. This is reflected in the "First Resolution of the Communist Party of China" (referred to as the "Resolution") which stipulates that the Party's basic task is to establish industrial unions, stating that "in places with more than one industry, unions should be organized" and the Party should instill class struggle spirit within the unions. It also emphasizes the establishment of workers' schools to raise workers' consciousness. In order to guide and promote the workers' movement, and considering the small number of Party members and the incomplete organization in various regions, the conference decided not to establish a Central Committee of the Party for the time being, but to form a Central Bureau responsible for leading the Party's work. Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and Zhang Guozhong were elected as the three members of the Central Bureau, with Chen Duxiu serving as the Secretary, Li Dazhao as the Propaganda Commissioner, and Zhang Guozhong as the Organization Commissioner.
The establishment of the Communist Party of China is a significant event in Chinese history. It signifies the presence of a united proletarian political party in China with communism as its goal and Marxism as its guide. Although the Party was weak when it was founded, it actually represented the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces and the direction of China's advanced culture. It has the potential to develop into the most trustworthy leadership and a strong core for the Chinese people.
The Party manifesto formulated at the First National Congress of the CPC, although lacking an understanding of the specific characteristics of Chinese society and Chinese revolution, largely copied the clauses of the party manifesto of proletarian political parties in capitalist countries. However, its essence embodies the basic principles of Marxist theory regarding the proletarian revolution, marking the establishment of the Communist Party of China with Marxism as its guiding position in the Party's work as a whole. The basic principles of Marxism must be combined with China's actual situation in theory. This was also recognized by early Marxist intellectuals in China. As mentioned earlier, in August 1919, in Li Dazhao's article "On the Problems and Isms", he pointed out that "a socialist, in order to have some influence with his ideology in the world, must study how to apply his thoughts to the surrounding reality as much as possible." In a letter to the Ukrainian Communist leader Zhu De in December 1920, Liu Renjing said: our current task is to "seek out a policy that is suitable for the national conditions and can achieve communism." Although the ideas were clear, achieving the integration of "ism" and "reality" and finding a policy "suitable for the national conditions and can achieve communism" was not something that the First National Congress of the CPC could achieve. It requires long-term struggle, multiple victories and failures, continuous summarization of the experience and lessons of practical struggle in order to achieve it.
The Introduction of the Basic Issues of Guiding Thoughts during the New Democratic Revolution
Section 1: The Initial Exploration of the Chinese Revolution by the Communists
I. The Practical Revolution and the Proposal of the Democratic Revolution Program
In the first year after its establishment, the Communist Party of China, through studying and mastering Marxism and engaging in revolutionary struggles, began to have a deeper understanding of the international and domestic situation, the social conditions of China, and the basic issues of the Chinese revolution.
At this time, the main characteristics of the international and domestic situation were as follows: imperialist countries intensified their aggression against China, attempting to further carve up China; and the contradictions and disputes among various warlords within China became more intense. In this situation, different political forces proposed their own claims for China's way out. Among the ruling class, the direct military cliques that controlled the central political power advocated "military unification," while the regional warlords demanded "autonomy" or "inter-provincial autonomy." These two opposing claims, in essence, were aimed at safeguarding the interests of the respective warlords and could not solve any of China's problems. Among the bourgeoisie, some reformists, represented by Hu Shi, advocated the establishment of a "good government," believing that there was no need to oppose imperialism or overthrow the rule of warlords; as long as the so-called "good people" entered the government, China would be saved. As for how these "good people" could enter the government and whether they could make an impact after entering, these were questions they were unable to answer. Although Sun Yat-sen still adhered to the revolutionary position of democracy, he was unable to put forward a revolutionary program that could mobilize the masses to rise up in struggle. In November 1920, after the power of the Guangxi warlord clique was expelled from Guangdong by the Guangdong Army, Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangzhou from Shanghai and raised the banner of "Protectorate." In April 1921, Sun Yat-sen was elected as the Provisional President of the Republic of China in a special session of the National Congress held in Guangdong. He planned to rely on Chen Jiongming's military power to launch the Northern Expedition with Guangdong as the base. Although Chen Jiongming was a member of the Kuomintang and ostensibly supported Sun Yat-sen's cause, even claiming to pursue socialism, he secretly accepted the instigation of imperialists and colluded with the direct military cliques. In June 1922, he openly launched an armed rebellion, ultimately exposing his reactionary nature as a tool of imperialism. Sun Yat-sen was forced to leave Guangzhou, and his Protectorate Movement was completely defeated.
Where was China heading? What was the future of the Chinese nation? Many patriotic intellectuals were troubled, lost, and worried about these questions. At this moment, the young Communist Party of China combined the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with the actual Chinese revolution, and proposed the program for the Chinese democratic revolution.
When the Chinese Communists, driven by the belief in overthrowing the oppressive rule of the reactionary class and realizing socialism, deeply engaged in practical struggles, they quickly discovered that under the conditions of semi-colonial and semi-feudalism, the Chinese people did not urgently need an immediate socialist revolution. Due to foreign capital controlling most of China's modern industries, whether it was the escalating strikes in Shanghai, Changsha, and Hong Kong or workers' movements in other cities, they inevitably clashed with imperialism and had varying degrees of anti-imperialist significance. Even though the economic struggle for improving living conditions of workers can easily transform into a political struggle against imperialism and warlord governments. Imperialist forces and feudal warlords always collude and make every effort to sabotage and even suppress these mass struggles through force. Communist Party members in China have come to realize through practical struggles that if the Chinese revolution does not primarily fight against imperialist aggression and feudal warlord rule, the country cannot achieve independence, the people cannot be liberated, and the ideals of socialism and communism cannot be realized. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic bourgeoisie in China share certain similarities in their revolutionary goals. This further understanding of the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution, which arises from practice, has propelled the Chinese Communist Party to determine realistic goals and corresponding strategies for striving towards the realization of the socialist ideal.
During the process of exploring and formulating a revolutionary program suitable for the Chinese national conditions, the Party received assistance and guidance from Lenin and the Communist International, which played an important role in ensuring that the Party correctly grasped the direction of China's revolution.
During this period, the Party, on the one hand, explored the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution through revolutionary practice, and on the other hand, accepted Lenin's theories on the national and colonial questions and began to integrate these two aspects, gradually brewing and forming a revolutionary program that broadly conforms to China's national conditions.
The Party first propagated its political propositions against imperialism and feudalism to labor union organizations and youth league organizations. The first National Labor Congress and the first Congress of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, held in May 1922, accepted the political slogans of "down with imperialism" and "down with warlords" proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. On June 15, 1922, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Declaration of the Communist Party of China on the Current Situation". These seven documents emphasized the analysis of the history and current situation of the oppression of the Chinese people by international imperialism and Chinese feudal warlords after the 1911 Revolution, pointing out that imperialist aggression and warlord politics are the root causes of China's internal and external troubles and the source of people's suffering. The documents criticized the reactionary propaganda spread by feudal warlords regarding the current situation and the mistaken propositions held by the bourgeois reformists, pointing out that the key to solving the current situation is to use revolutionary means to overthrow imperialism and feudal warlords and establish democratic politics. The documents also pointed out that to fulfill the most urgent task of the proletariat at present, the Communist Party of China advocates the establishment of a united front for democracy with the Kuomintang and other revolutionary parties and organizations, to oppose the common enemy and liberate the Chinese people from the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal warlords.
This is the first time that the Communist Party of China has openly proclaimed its political propositions on the major issues of the Chinese democratic revolution to various sectors of society. It is also a new starting point for the Party to analyze the social conditions in China and solve the problems of the Chinese revolution using Marxist-Leninist principles. It laid the foundation for the Party to complete the historical task of formulating a program for the democratic revolution at its Second National Congress. From July 16 to 23, 1922, the Communist Party of China held its Second National Congress in Shanghai. The Manifesto of the Communist Party of China on the Second National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a document of great historical significance. It analyzes the history of capitalism, imperialism, and the transformation of Chinese society into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, emphasizing that "all kinds of facts prove that the greatest suffering inflicted on the Chinese people (whether they are bourgeois workers or peasants) comes from the capitalist imperialist and feudal forces of the military and bureaucratic warlords. Therefore, it is highly meaningful to oppose the two forces through democratic revolutionary movements, in that the success of the democratic revolution can bring about independence and relatively greater freedom." Based on the analysis of the international and domestic situations and the nature of Chinese society, the Manifesto puts forward the Party's goals under the current historical conditions, which are: to eliminate internal strife, overthrow warlords, and build domestic peace; to overthrow the oppression of international imperialism and achieve complete independence for the Chinese nation; to unify China into a truly democratic republic.This actually formulates the democratic revolutionary program of the party in the current stage of anti-imperialist and anti-feudalism, which is the party's minimum program. The manifesto also points out: the party's aim is to "organize the proletariat, use class struggle means, establish a political power of labor and peasant, eradicate the system of private property, gradually achieve a communist society." This indicates that the manifesto of the 2nd National Congress of the CPC adheres to the ultimate goal of struggle set by the 1st Congress, which is the party's maximum program.
The manifesto of the 2nd National Congress of the CPC initially elucidates the nature, target, impetus, strategy, tasks, and goals of the Chinese revolution in the current stage, and points out the future of the Chinese revolution. These are: the nature of the revolution is democratic revolution; the target of the revolution is imperialism and feudal warlords; the impetus of the revolution is the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie, with the national bourgeoisie also being one of the forces of the revolution; the strategy of the revolution is to form a united front of various classes; the tasks and goals of the revolution are to overthrow the warlords, overthrow the oppression of international imperialism, achieve the independence of the Chinese nation and the unification of China; the future of the revolution is to transform into a socialist revolution.
The 2nd National Congress of the CPC for the first time combines the goals that the party should achieve in the democratic revolution with the long-term goals that will be achieved in the future socialist revolution, not only clearly proposing the democratic revolutionary tasks of opposing imperialism and feudalism, but also pointing out that socialism and communism should be realized through the democratic revolution. This is a deepening of the CPC's understanding of the Chinese national situation and the Chinese revolution, and an important achievement of the party in combining the basic principles of Marxism with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. It provides direction for the deeply troubled Chinese nation to achieve independence and liberation, for the correct conduct of the Chinese revolution. From the 1st Congress of the party determining to directly engage in socialist revolution, to the 2nd National Congress of the CPC determining to first carry out the democratic revolution "and then carry out the socialist revolution, this is a major shift in the party's strategic policy.
The 2nd National Congress of the CPC made preliminary analysis of the specific connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The manifesto of the 2nd National Congress of the CPC points out: "The success of the democratic revolution only gives the proletariat some freedom and rights but does not completely liberate them. After the success of the democratic revolution, the immature bourgeoisie will rapidly develop, and it will be in an antagonistic position with the proletariat. Therefore, the proletariat must confront the bourgeoisie and implement the second stage of struggle, which is the 'dictatorship of the proletariat in alliance with poor peasants'. If the organization strength and fighting power of the proletariat are strong, this second stage of struggle can immediately succeed after the victory of the democratic revolution." Chinese communists estimated there were two possibilities for the future of the democratic revolution: one is that if the strength of the proletariat develops greatly in the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution of proletarian dictatorship can be immediately implemented after the victory of the democratic revolution; the other is that after the victory of the democratic revolution, the bourgeoisie "seizes power from feudalism," and the proletariat needs to wait for a long period of time to strengthen its own strength before implementing the second stage of struggle. At that time, young Chinese communists only made preliminary efforts to mobilize the workers' movement and lacked revolutionary experience. Some people, influenced by the experience of the bourgeois revolution in Europe and the United States, considered the latter possibility more when thinking about the future of the democratic revolution. There were also some people who, starting from the experience of the February and October revolutions in Russia, considered the former possibility of quickly developing from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. However, in China, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with complex national conditions, what path will lead to this future is still not clear to them.
The program of a political party is its banner.The revolutionary program proposed by the Second Party Congress upholds and encompasses the highest ideals of the proletarian party in the pursuit of communism. It also clearly articulates the party's action plan and revolutionary tasks for the current stage, namely, to carry out the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism. In just one year since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has been able to preliminarily understand the relationship between the minimum program and the maximum program based on the Chinese national conditions. This indicates that only the Communist Party of China, guided by Marxism and combining it with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution, can scientifically analyze the current state of Chinese society, reflect the desires and demands of the Chinese people, point out the correct direction for the Chinese revolution, and shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution.
In order to implement the party's program for the democratic revolution, the Second Party Congress passed nine resolutions. The congress approved the resolution on the "Democratic United Front," calling for workers and peasants nationwide to unite and struggle under the banner of the Communist Party. At the same time, it proposed to unite all revolutionary parties and the democratic factions of the bourgeoisie to form a democratic united front. It also decided to invite the Nationalist Party and other revolutionary groups to hold joint meetings to discuss specific measures. This overturned the provision in the First Party Congress document that prohibited establishing any connections with other parties, and it was the earliest expression of the idea and proposition of a united front by the party. It has significant implications for advancing the development of the Chinese revolution.
The basic ideas of the Chinese revolution began to take shape with the outbreak of the May 30th Movement in 1925, marking the arrival of a high tide of revolution. The political attitudes of various social classes in Chinese society were also fully demonstrated during the movement, and the contradictions over leadership within the revolutionary united front became increasingly apparent. The vivid and rich revolutionary practice provided Communist Party members with many fresh experiences, while the complex revolutionary struggles posed new questions for which there were no ready-made answers for the Communists. They had to consider and explore these issues from various angles. Leaders of the party such as Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Qu Qiubai, Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen, Deng Zhongxia, Zhou Enlai, and Shen Duanqing, based on timely summaries of revolutionary practice, engaged in extensive discussions, thus elevating the party's understanding of the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution to a new level.
The party's understanding of the nature and future of the Chinese revolution underwent a gradual deepening. The Second Party Congress clearly stated that the nature of the Chinese revolution was a bourgeois democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and warlords, with the future transition to socialism. In May 1923, Cai Hesen pointed out in his writing that the nature of the Chinese revolutionary movement was different from the bourgeois democratic revolutions in Europe and the United States. He stated that it was no longer purely a question of a bourgeois democratic revolution but had, in fact, become a national revolution (which could also be called a nationalistic revolution).
After the May 30th Movement, the communists further explored the question of the revolutionary nature. Mao Zedong pointed out that the bourgeois revolutions in Europe, America, and Japan were "the revolutions of one class, the bourgeois class," and their goal was to build a nationalist state that would be ruled by the bourgeoisie. On the other hand, the Chinese national revolution was a revolution in which the petty bourgeoisie, semi-proletariat, and proletariat cooperated, aiming to build a state ruled by revolutionary masses. Qu Qiubai believed that in the era of imperialism, the era of social revolution, the national revolution in weak colonial nations "inevitably contains the seeds of the proletarian revolution." Because this kind of revolution "in the international scope is nothing more than a part of the world proletarian revolution; in the scope of a single country, although it is still bourgeois in nature, the revolutionary forces must be predominantly composed of the proletariat."
Although the concept of the New Democratic Revolution had not yet been proposed by the Communists at this time, they had already begun to distinguish this revolution from previous democratic revolutions in terms of the era's conditions, leadership of the revolution, and goals of the struggle. This provided the ideological foundation for the Party's later explicit theory of the New Democratic Revolution.
Regarding the future of the Chinese revolution, particularly the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the Party's Fourth National Congress believed that the "Chinese national revolutionary movement" was "part of the broad world revolution" and connected with the "construction of communism by overthrowing world capitalism." After the May 30th Movement, Qu Qiubai pointed out that although the democratic revolution "belongs to the bourgeoisie, its victory will not be a victory for the bourgeoisie." If the revolution is led by the bourgeoisie, it will quickly compromise with the enemy. He also pointed out that it is now the era of imperialism and the beginning of the socialist revolution, so "there is no need or possibility for the primitive private capitalism on the colonies of weak nations to continue to develop." The economy can be planned and gradually developed by the working masses in an organized state, progressing towards socialism. He repeatedly emphasized that the Chinese democratic revolution is the "first step towards communism." Qu Qiubai fully emphasized the responsibility of the proletariat for the leadership of the Chinese revolution and the non-capitalist future of the Chinese revolution, which is correct. However, he had two misconceptions in his understanding: firstly, he denied the strategic thinking of the Chinese revolution being achieved in two stages, confusing the boundaries between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; secondly, he understood the non-capitalist future as the immediate elimination of private capitalist economic components and proposed an anti-bourgeois task in the democratic revolution stage.
In the democratic revolution, understanding and treating the bourgeoisie are complex issues. The Communist Party's understanding of this issue has gradually improved and deepened. The First Congress of the Party believed that the bourgeoisie was the target of the revolution; the Second Congress of the Party recognized that the democratic faction of the bourgeoisie could be a united force; the Third Congress of the Party recognized to a certain extent the dual nature of the majority of the Chinese bourgeoisie; and by the Fourth Congress, it was clearly pointed out that the Chinese bourgeoisie can be divided into the reactionary "big comprador bourgeoisie" and the emerging "national industrial bourgeoisie." During the May 30th Movement, the national bourgeoisie initially actively participated in the anti-imperialist struggle and played an important role, but later compromised and showed its dual nature in politics, thereby providing objective conditions for the Communists to conduct a deeper analysis of this class.
Mao Zedong made excellent remarks on this issue in his analysis of the social classes in China on December 1, 1925. In his article, he pointed out that the middle class had a "contradictory attitude" towards the revolution. When they felt the pain of being attacked by foreign capital and oppressed by warlords, they needed a revolution and supported the revolutionary movement against imperialism and warlords. However, when the revolution had the vigorous participation of the domestic proletariat and active support from the international proletariat, posing a threat to their desire to reach the status of the big bourgeoisie, they became suspicious of the revolution. The right wing of the bourgeoisie would quickly join the ranks of imperialism and warlords when the revolutionary struggle intensified, becoming good partners with the comprador bourgeoisie. The left wing, at certain times, had a revolutionary nature but was prone to compromise and could not be sustained. Therefore, they can be regarded as our friends, but "we must be vigilant against them and not let them disrupt our ranks."
Having this understanding is crucial. In the context of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party during the Great Revolution, it was not easy for the young Chinese Communist Party to deal with the contradiction of actively uniting the national bourgeoisie to participate in the revolution while engaging in necessary struggles against their wavering and compromises. Many Communists did not understand that as long as the proletariat firmly grasped the political leadership of the national revolutionary movement, it was possible to promote the participation of a part or even a majority of the national bourgeoisie in the revolution, but constant vigilance against potential disruptions to the revolutionary front was also needed.Mao Zedong's analysis of the national bourgeoisie objectively reflects the actual situation of class struggle at that time, providing an important theoretical basis for the party to deepen its understanding and correctly handle the relationship with the national bourgeoisie.
The peasant issue is another important problem in the Chinese revolution. Before the Fourth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the party had realized the important position of peasants in the revolution. The Fourth National Congress affirmed that peasants were allies of the proletariat. The "Resolution on the Workers and Peasants' Union" passed at the Second National Labor Conference in May 1925 regarded guiding peasants to participate in the democratic revolution and establishing a solid alliance with peasants as a guarantee for the victory of the democratic revolution. In the later stages of the May 30th Movement, the painful experience of the working class being isolated due to the wavering and compromise of the national bourgeoisie further proved that the uprising of peasants' struggles was an essential condition for the success of the national revolution. Peasants are the most needed and reliable allies of the working class.
The May 30th Movement made many communists further realize the position of peasants in the democratic revolution and the importance of establishing a workers-peasants alliance. In October 1925, the enlarged meeting of the CPC Central Committee proposed to include the resolution of the peasants' land problem in the party's political program, believing that "the Chinese Communist Party should make the general democratic factions know that confiscating land is an inevitable policy and an important duty to complete the 1911 Revolution." The meeting emphasized that the party can only fulfill its historical mission by forming a "consolidated alliance" with peasants. After investigating the economic situation of Chinese peasants, Li Dazhao pointed out, "If the vast masses of Chinese peasants can be organized and participate in the national revolution, the success of China's national revolution will not be far away." Chen Duxiu emphasized that Chinese workers not only need to expand and consolidate their own class united front, but also urgently need to establish a workers-peasants alliance... Only in this way can the working class achieve initial victories in political and economic struggles.
Starting from 1925, Mao Zedong took the lead in leading the peasant movement and paid attention to studying the peasant issue in China. After "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," he published the article "Analysis of the Classes in the Chinese Peasantry and Their Attitudes Towards the Revolution" in the first issue of "Chinese Peasants" in January 1926, preliminarily applying the Marxist class analysis method. He divided rural residents into eight classes: big landlords, small landlords, self-employed farmers, semi-self-employed farmers, semi-tenant farmers, poor farmers, hired laborers, rural craftsmen, and wanderers. He conducted a relatively in-depth scientific analysis of the attitudes of each class towards the revolution, thus forming a preliminary theoretical framework for analyzing the rural class. This laid an important foundation for the Chinese Communist Party to correctly understand the position and role of peasants in the democratic revolution, and to formulate the correct policies towards peasants. In May 1926, the party-led Second Provincial Peasants' Representatives Conference in Guangdong specifically made the "Resolution on the Position of the Peasant Movement in the National Revolution," stating that "China's national revolution as a semi-colonial country is a peasant revolution," and "the peasant question is a central issue in the national revolution. Whether the national revolution can progress and succeed depends on whether the peasant movement can progress and succeed." Regarding the peasant question as the central issue of the national revolution indicates that the party has gained a relatively profound understanding of the important position of peasants in the Chinese revolution.
Before the Fourth National Congress, members of the Communist Party had already discussed to varying degrees the issue of proletarian leadership. The Fourth National Congress of the CPC explicitly raised the issue of proletarian leadership in the democratic revolution, but there was still a lack of understanding of the seriousness of the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for leadership and the ways to achieve proletarian leadership.
In the May 30th Movement, the Chinese working class once again fully demonstrated its strength, while the bourgeoisie showed its dual nature in the movement. Subsequently, the right-wing of the Kuomintang intensified its attacks on revolutionary forces.These facts further made the communists realize the importance of the proletariat's struggle for leadership over the bourgeoisie. Chen Duxiu pointed out in summarizing the experience of the May 30th Movement: While the May 30th Movement was indeed a national struggle united by various classes, in reality, it was the striking workers in places like Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Jiaozuo who directly fought against imperialism. Other people from different walks of life were merely offering support to the working class, so while we cannot exaggerate and say that Chinese workers were the sole force of the revolution, we must acknowledge that they were an important and reliable power. On the other hand, the compromising and hesitant attitudes of the bourgeoisie were enough for imperialists and warlords to take advantage of. Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The working class made the greatest sacrifices, held the most radical views, fought the most persistently, and demonstrated incredible strength in the anti-imperialist movement of May 30th. These facts prove unequivocally that the working class holds the leadership position in the national revolutionary movement in China." "The Chinese bourgeoisie, although oppressed by imperialism and warlords, have the potential to participate in the national revolutionary movement. However, their participation in the national revolutionary movement ultimately leads to compromise and is not thorough." Qu Qiubai believed that the weakness and retreat of the bourgeoisie during the May 30th Movement led to setbacks in the strike struggle. The compromising nature of the bourgeoisie and the hesitancy and cowardice of the petty bourgeoisie are enough to prove the necessity for the proletariat to gain leadership in the national revolution.
Regarding the issue of the proletariat's struggle for leadership over the bourgeoisie, the communists propose an important viewpoint: this struggle should not be limited to mass movements, but should also pay attention to the issue of state power. Deng Zhongxia explicitly stated: "For the national revolution, we participated to gain political power. However, political power does not just fall into the hands of the workers. We have to gradually and painstakingly seize it through actual political struggles." He emphasized in particular: "If we don't take political power, the bourgeoisie will." Only when the proletariat's political position and power continue to grow and consolidate can we "prevent the bourgeoisie from softening and compromising in the revolution and stop them from monopolizing state power after the revolution," thus "preparing for the establishment of a workers' government in the future." Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The workers are the leaders of the national revolution. They should lead the peasants and soldiers to unite and jointly overthrow imperialism." In July 1926, under the intense situation of the Kuomintang's intensified anti-communist sentiment by the old and new right-wing factions, the expanded meeting of the Party's Central Executive Committee stated in the "Resolution on the Relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang": "Our strategy in the national revolution should be more clearly defined: On the one hand, our party should more vigorously demonstrate its independence politically, establish its influence among workers and the majority of peasants, and gain political influence among the general masses; on the other hand, we should organize and rally the revolutionary currents of the petty bourgeoisie to join the Kuomintang, enrich its left-wing, and exert stronger influence on the Kuomintang with the revolutionary forces of the proletariat and peasants - in this way, we can form a powerful alliance with the left-wing of the Kuomintang in the struggle against the bourgeoisie for the leadership of the national movement. Only then can we ensure that the proletarian political party seizes leadership in the national revolution." These statements illustrate that, through the education of facts, the Chinese communists have deepened their understanding of the proletariat's leadership role, moving beyond general discussions of the struggle for leadership between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to how to obtain political leadership within the Kuomintang.
Regarding armed struggle as the main form of the Chinese revolution, the Party also made new progress in its understanding at this time. Previously, the communists criticized the Kuomintang for focusing exclusively on military work and neglecting mass movements, while they themselves tended to focus only on mass movements and neglect military work. During the process of unifying the revolutionary base in Guangdong, the Party began to pay attention to the military operations and strengthen propaganda among warlord troops to promote their division and encourage some to lean towards revolution.In June 1925, Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech during the return journey of the Northern Expedition that the army is a tool, "oppressors use this tool to oppress people", and the oppressed class "can also use this tool to resist their oppressors, overthrow the oppressors' power"; as for overthrowing imperialism and feudal warlords, "the army is the vanguard of realizing our theory".
The Party also initially realized the importance of arming the workers and peasants. After the start of the Great Strike of Guangzhou and Hong Kong, the Communists saw the important role played by the workers' picket teams in consolidating the revolutionary base in Guangdong, and regarded them as the vanguard of the Chinese nation's anti-imperialist struggle. In October 1925, the expanded meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the CPC discussed the issue of arming the working class and proposed the need to organize and prepare the bravest and most loyal elements in the armed working class.
Regarding the importance of armed struggle and revolutionary armies during the period of the national revolution, Qu Qiubai made a comparatively systematic exposition in his article "The Problem of Armed Struggle in the Chinese Revolution". He pointed out that the Chinese people had already engaged in struggles such as demonstrations, resistance, and strikes, "but, from the 'May Fourth', 'July Seventh', 'May Thirtieth', 'March Eighteenth', and the Guangzhou war up to now, the turbulent waves of revolution have been advancing vigorously, and the use of these various forms of struggle has reached the preparatory stage for armed direct confrontation, almost the time for a life or death struggle." "Especially during this period, revolutionary war is the main means", while other forms of struggle are either directly or indirectly preparing for revolutionary war. Qu Qiubai pointed out: "The Chinese national revolution urgently needs a formal revolutionary army", grassroots armed forces and armed uprisings have always found it difficult to overcome powerful enemies, so a formal revolutionary army composed of workers, peasants, and petite-bourgeois masses must be organized and trained. He said: "Politically, the main body is the political party of the revolutionary masses; militarily, the main body is the formal revolutionary army, engaging in revolutionary combat... only then can the Chinese common people have hope for complete liberation." This is an early article within the Party that specifically discusses the issue of armed struggle. It not only provided propaganda encouragement for the imminent Northern Expedition, but also made pioneering theoretical contributions to the Party's exploration of the revolutionary path in China.
The above discussions on several aspects constitute the basic thinking of the Communist Party of China about the Chinese revolution, namely: the proletariat leads the peasants and other petite-bourgeoisie, seeks the support of a portion of the national bourgeoisie, engages in a democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, overthrows the reactionary rule represented by the warlord regime and the big comprador and landlord classes, and establishes a united dictatorship of various revolutionary classes; under the historical conditions of China's international and domestic situation, it is unrealistic for the national bourgeoisie to attempt to lead this revolution to victory and establish bourgeois dictatorship; this revolution, as part of the world proletarian revolution, will lay the groundwork for China's transition to socialist revolution. These ideas were put forward by many important members of the Communist Party of China in their respective explorations at that time. Although there were still inaccuracies and incompleteness, and their understandings were not completely consistent with each other, they were valuable achievements of the Chinese communists' efforts to apply Marxism to the Chinese situation, and they had significant pioneering significance for the formation of the later theory of the New Democratic Revolution.
III. Differences and the emergence of erroneous theories in revolutionary practice
The victorious advance of the Northern Expedition and the vigorous development of the worker and peasant movements have brought about significant changes in the political and military situation in the south and even the whole country. During this period, the Communist International and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as their representatives in China, put forward some principled and correct policies, providing valuable guidance to the Communist Party of China. However, due to their lack of vigilance against the danger of betrayal of the revolution by people like Chiang Kai-shek, they adopted incorrect policies in dealing with their relationships with Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Tang Shengzhi, which had a negative impact on the decision-making of the Central Committee of  the CPC. The most concentrated manifestation of this was the formation and development of Chen Duxiu's right-wing deviationist errors.
In the case of the great strides of the revolution, the issue of revolutionary power was prominently raised before the party. The deepening of the urban and rural workers' and peasants' movement has led to changes in the political power of many counties. In Hunan Province, some counties established County Administrative Councils or Joint Councils of Public Law, which were attended by representatives from the County Farmers' Association, County Workers' Union, and other revolutionary mass organizations. Although they did not elect their own county chiefs, the existing county chiefs had to listen to the opinions of various mass organizations. In fact, it formed a situation where mass organizations jointly held political power. In some counties of Jiangxi Province, Communist Party members served as county chiefs due to the widespread support of the masses. In terms of provincial political power, Communist Party members Dong Biwu participated in the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Lin Zuhan and Li Fuchun participated in the Jiangxi Provincial Political Bureau. The participation of Communist Party members and representatives of workers and peasants in the revolutionary political power was a new development during the victory and development of the Northern Expedition.
Although the participation of Communists in revolutionary political power has become a necessity for the further development of the revolution, the central leadership's understanding of this issue lagged behind the situation and once existed in a mistaken understanding. In September 1926, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China entrusted Tan Pingshan, who was attending the 7th expanded plenary meeting of the Communist International Executive Committee, to consult the Communist International: Can Communist Party members participate in the government? However, before the Communist International could respond, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to the party, severely criticizing and stopping the practice of Communist Party members participating in the government, emphasizing that the Communist Party must be based on the position of an opposition party in the stage of the national revolution, and should fully express an independent opposition party attitude.
The policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to adopt the position of an opposition party is directly related to the prevailing erroneous notion that regards mass movements as superior to everything else and considers participation in the government as a means to seek official positions. Influenced by this notion, the Central Committee proposed to sternly banish the tendency of "opportunist officials" within the party, ordering Communist Party members who served as county chiefs in places like Jiujiang and Yongxiu to immediately resign, and emphasized that "in the future, all of our manpower must be devoted to the masses, without participating in government work." On the other hand, more importantly, there was still no clear understanding of how to transition from the democratic revolution to socialism among the entire party, especially among the main leaders of the party. In July 1926, the Second Expanded Meeting of the Fourth Executive Committee of the Central Committee, in the adopted "Central Political Report," regarded "the construction of national capitalism" as the "future" that the "national revolutionary movement" should strive for. In September, Chen Duxiu stated in his article "Why Are We Struggling Now?" that the realization of this future depends on victory "placed in the hands of the national government and the national army" and that "only then can genuine Chinese capitalism develop freely." The article asserted that there would be no Communist Party striving for political power during the period of the national revolution, and believed that "the Communist Party obtaining political power is a matter of the proletarian revolution era." At the end of 1926, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China initially recognized the significance of participating in political power and decided that Communist Party members should strive to participate in provincial governments. After the 7th expanded plenary meeting of the Communist International Executive Committee explicitly put forward the requirement for Communist Party members to join government agencies, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China further recognized the necessity and urgency of participating in political power and sent Tan Pingshan, Su Zhaozheng, and others to participate in the work of the National Government and local governments. However, due to the rapid deterioration of the situation, they did not play an important role in practice.
Neither Chen Duxiu nor the majority of the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China gave sufficient attention to the establishment of armed forces directly under the leadership of the Communist Party. Before the start of the Northern Expedition, there were about two thousand Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the graduates of the Whampoa Military Academy. The vast number of workers and peasants in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi seized a large number of guns and ammunition from the dispersed enemy forces and urgently demanded to arm themselves. Many officers of the National Revolutionary Army also invited members of the Communist Party to assist in their work. However, Chen Duxiu opposed making use of these favorable conditions to develop revolutionary armed forces directly under the party's control. After the start of the Northern Expedition, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) decided to send fewer Communist Party members to study at the Whampoa Military Academy, and comrades engaged in labor and peasant movements were "absolutely forbidden to abandon their work and go to" the military academy. The central committee also demanded that Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members engaged in political work in the National Revolutionary Army "only focus on political propaganda and not interfere with military and administrative matters". Therefore, during the Northern Expedition, the party not only did not establish more directly controlled regular armed forces, but also did not consolidate and develop the existing considerable number of armed forces of workers and peasants.
With the progress of the Northern Expedition, the dangerous tendencies within the National Revolutionary United Front became increasingly apparent. Faced with a complex and changing situation, the Chinese Communist Party faced difficulties: on one hand, the task of overthrowing the Northern Warlords was yet to be fully completed, and on the other hand, contradictions within the revolutionary camp became pronounced. How to deal with these complex external and internal contradictions, how to deal with the betrayal and sudden attacks of allies, have become urgent problems that need to be resolved. For the inexperienced communists, this is indeed a major challenge.
In order to analyze the various dangerous tendencies that emerged in the National Revolutionary United Front, and to formulate the party's struggle strategy, the Central Committee of the CPC held a special conference in Wuhan in mid-December 1926. Representatives of the Communist International, including Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov and Grigory Yevseyevich Zinoviev, attended the conference. In the political report, Chen Duxiu pointed out that after the victory on the Jiangxi battlefield, many new changes and dangerous tendencies appeared in our relationship with the Kuomintang, posing a constant risk of breaking the united front. When analyzing the causes of these dangers, although it also acknowledged the right-wing tendencies of the Kuomintang, and acknowledged that although Chiang Kai-shek made left-leaning statements, his actual actions were right-leaning, it could not come up with any effective solutions to the problem. Instead, it heavily criticized the so-called left-leaning within the party, which belittles the Kuomintang, monopolizes the Kuomintang, monopolizes the popular movement, denies the existence of the left, misunderstands the party's independence, and has poor policies towards small and medium-sized merchants, and so on. The report believed that the "most serious trend at present is that on the one hand, the popular movement is becoming more and more 'left', while on the other hand, the military government is becoming more and more terrified of the rise of the popular movement", this "left" and right-leaning trend is getting further apart, and "it is the main cause of the rupture of the general united front and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party". This statement, on the one hand, exaggerates the extreme tendencies in the workers' and peasant movements as the main danger, even portraying some correct practices as "left-leaning"; on the other hand, it conceals the fundamental danger of the new right-wing preparing to betray the revolution, completely reversing the importance of the matter. The report proposed the central idea of the seven measures to salvage the crisis, "prevent the right-leaning outside the party, and at the same time oppose the 'left-leaning' within the party". This clearly reflects this mistaken understanding.
The conference passed the "Resolution on the Issue of Left-wing Tendencies in the Kuomintang", which stipulated that support should be given to the left-wing of the Kuomintang from various aspects, so as to form a powerful political force to fight against the reactionary tendencies of the right-wing forces. The resolution believed that although the left-wing of the Kuomintang was weak and wavering, they should still be united and supported. This is, in fact, placing all hopes of fighting against the right-wing on the left-wing of the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu and others regarded some military officers and politicians who made certain left-leaning expressions as reliable leftists within the Kuomintang, especially placing too high hopes on Wang Jingwei. They not only advocated handing over the party and political power of the Kuomintang to them, but also advocated handing over the popular movement that had always been led by the Communist Party to them for leadership. This inevitably had serious consequences during times of sudden reversal in the future situation. 
The policy proposed at this conference to salvage the crisis was based not on focusing on consolidating and strengthening the power of the Communist Party itself, but rather, it failed to make adequate spiritual and practical preparations to deal with sudden changes. Instead, it placed complete hope on Wang Jingwei and other Kuomintang military leaders, fantasizing that concessions would lead to unity.This policy has objectively resulted in two consequences: on the one hand, it spreads harmful illusions among the masses, making it seem as though Chiang Kai-shek, who has already shown hostility, may still have a change of heart and shift from right to left; and it suggests that Wang Jingwei, who is weak and opportunistic, could form a powerful leftist group to take on the heavy responsibility of completing the nationalist revolution. On the other hand, it is a blow to the energetic development of the worker and peasant revolution, dampening the enthusiasm of the masses and suppressing their movements. In essence, this policy sacrifices the fundamental interests of the workers and peasants to accommodate the right-wing of the Kuomintang, providing convenience for Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to seize control of the party.
The Hankou Special Conference did not resolve the extremely important question of how the party can survive and continue the struggle in the imminent crisis. Instead, it led them in the wrong direction, gradually developing right-wing opportunism from the right-leaning mistakes within the party. The decisions made in this conference were approved by the Central Political Bureau and the joint meeting of representatives from the Communist International. This was an important subjective factor that led to the failure of the Great Revolution.
Section 2: The Twisted Course of the Initial Period of Land Revolution War and the Fundamental Issues of Chinese Revolution
I. A significant progress in understanding the fundamental issues of the Chinese Revolution
After the failure of the Great Revolution, there was a dramatic reversal in the domestic political situation. The counter-revolutionary forces had greatly surpassed the organized revolutionary forces led by the Communist Party, and the nationwide revolutionary upsurge had passed, transitioning into a low tide of revolution.
The failure of the Great Revolution demonstrated that party leadership, united front, and armed struggle are the fundamental issues of the Chinese Revolution. Only by correctly recognizing and addressing these problems can the revolutionary cause advance and achieve ultimate success. The harsh reality profoundly educated the Communist Party of China.
In order to review and rectify the party's serious mistakes during the later period of the Great Revolution, determine the new line and policies, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an emergency conference (the Eighth Route Conference) in Hankou, Hubei, on August 7, 1927. At the conference, representative of the Communist International, Radek, presented a report and conclusion on the party's past mistakes and the new line. Qu Qiubai, representing the Central Standing Committee, presented a report on the future work guidelines. Many party members criticized the right-leaning mistakes of the Central Committee in dealing with the Kuomintang issue, the peasant land issue, and the armed struggle issue. Some party members also criticized certain errors of the Soviet advisers and representatives of the Communist International.
The conference adopted documents such as the "Circular of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Party Members" and demanded a firm rectification of the party's past mistakes, calling on party members and revolutionary masses to continue the fight. The conference specifically criticized the right-wing opportunistic mistakes and other errors committed by the Central Committee, led by Chen Duxiu, during the later period of the Great Revolution, pointing out that the Central Committee completely abandoned the Communist Party's independent political stance in its relationship with the Kuomintang, adopting a policy of compromise and concession. Regarding the issue of revolutionary armed forces, the Central Committee did not consider the necessity of arming the workers and peasants nor the need to establish a truly revolutionary army of workers and peasants, and even issued orders to dissolve the workers' picket groups. The Central Committee did not actively support and lead the peasant revolutionary movement, but rather was influenced by intimidation from Kuomintang leaders, hesitating to put forward a revolutionary action program to solve the land problem. The Central Committee was not subject to the supervision of the masses, and there was a lack of democratic life within the party. The "Circular of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Party Members" declared, "Our party openly acknowledges and rectifies its mistakes, without any ambiguity or concealment. This is not a sign of weakness but a demonstration of the strength of the Chinese Communist movement."
The conference summarized the lessons from the failure of the Great Revolution and discussed the party's work tasks, establishing the policy of implementing land revolution and armed uprising.
Regarding the land revolution, the conference, based on the instructions of the Communist International, and in accordance with the spirit of the notice issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on July 20, 1927, clearly stated that the land revolution is the central issue of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution and the main socio-economic content of the new stage of the Chinese revolution. The conference pointed out that the main focus is to solve the land problem with "popular" revolutionary methods, confiscate the land of large and medium-sized landlords, confiscate all so-called public lands such as ancestral temples and clan halls, and distribute them to tenant farmers or landless peasants. Rent reduction should be implemented for small landlords. The decision made by the conference answered the critical question facing the Chinese revolution at that time. In China, the feudal land system is an important foundation for imperialist and feudal comprador reactionary rule. Resolving the peasants' land problem has always been the fundamental issue of the revolution. After the establishment of the Communist Party of China, although attention was paid to solving the peasants' land problem and the struggle for rent reduction was carried out in certain areas, this problem was never properly resolved. After the failure of the Great Revolution, for the Chinese Communist Party to independently lead the revolutionary struggle, it must abolish the feudal landlords' land ownership and implement the system of "land to the tiller". Only in this way can it gain the support and participation of the majority of the rural population, and only in this way can armed struggle be carried out and a revolutionary regime be established with a broad and reliable mass base. Therefore, the implementation of land revolution not only reflects the fundamental requirement of the Chinese revolution, but also meets the needs of the struggle at the time.
Regarding the armed uprising, the conference clearly stated that the party's most important task at present is to systematically and plannedly prepare for a general peasant uprising in a broad area as much as possible. The conference believed that the main force of the peasant movement is the poor peasants, and it decided to dispatch the most active, strong, and experienced fighters to various major provinces to initiate and lead peasant uprisings, organize the revolutionary army of workers and peasants, establish the revolutionary regime of workers and peasants, and solve the peasants' land problem. The conference emphasized that the workers' movement and the peasants' armed uprisings must be combined, and attention should be paid to arming the workers and their training in urban guerrilla warfare, so as to be immediately prepared to respond to the peasants' uprisings. The working class should always be prepared to lead and participate in armed uprisings. The decision made by the conference to armedly resist the slaughter policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries was a correct conclusion drawn after paying a painful sacrifice. It was a major progress in understanding the Chinese revolution by the Chinese Communists. The conference passed the "Resolution on Party Organizational Issues", which stipulated that before the 6th National Congress of the Party, all powers of the Central Committee would be exercised by the Central Temporary Politburo. Considering that underground work would become the main form of work for the Party in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, the resolution proposed that the main task in the current organizational issue is to create a strong and able underground organization, and party organizations at all levels should strengthen the Party's underground work, while also utilizing all possible public means to expand the Party's influence.
In the summary of the mistakes made by the party in the later stage of the Great Revolution, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee believed that the majority of the Party's leadership consisted of intellectuals and representatives of the petite bourgeoisie, which was an important reason. Therefore, it demanded the promotion of worker comrades to assume major responsibilities in the Party's committees. Influenced by this understanding, shortly after the conference, the Party issued a central notice (number 2), pointing out that the political opportunism of the Party would inevitably affect the Party's organization. Its main manifestation was the composition of the Party's various leading organs, in which workers and peasants have always been an absolute minority. To change this situation, the notice proposed that the composition of the Party's leading organs should be worker- and peasant-oriented, and active workers and peasants who have shown enthusiasm in the struggle should be promoted to assume responsibilities in the Party's leading organs at all levels; the Party's membership should also be worker- and peasant-oriented, and a large number of workers and peasants should be actively and promptly admitted to the Party. This inappropriate emphasis on the pure worker-peasant composition of the leadership organs and party members' thinking, divorced from the actual social conditions of China and the Party, had a negative impact on the Party's construction in the future. Especially during the period when the "Left" error dominated the center, the "theory of exclusive elements" was repeatedly emphasized, which seriously hindered the healthy development of the party's organization.
In his speech, Mao Zedong criticized Chen Duxiu's rightist errors and raised two very important issues. One is the issue of military struggle, where he criticized the party's previous tendency to "focus on popular movements and not on military campaigns," and proposed, "we must pay close attention to the military in the future, and we must understand that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This conclusion was drawn from the bloody lessons of the failure of the Great Revolution. It pointed out the characteristics of the Chinese revolution and essentially raised the question of making military struggle the focus of the party's work. The other issue is the issue of peasant land. Mao proposed to establish standards for large and medium landlords, and suggested a 50-acre limit, with confiscation of all land over 50 acres, regardless of its fertility. The issue of small landlords is the central issue of the land problem. If the land of small landlords is not confiscated, "there will be many places without large landlords, and the rural cooperatives will have to cease their work. Therefore, the landlord system must be completely abolished, and there should be certain measures for small landlords. Now is the time to solve the problem of small landlords, so that peace can be achieved." The rights of middle peasants and rich peasants who are self-employed farmers are different, and the farmers must attack the rich peasants, so the direction must be determined. This suggestion is in line with the land ownership situation in the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong areas and laid the foundation for understanding in formulating the correct land revolution line in the future. However, the representatives of the Communist International did not adopt Mao Zedong's correct views, instead proposing that the fundamental solution to the land problem is to implement state ownership of land.
In the situation of serious crisis in the Chinese revolution, the timely convening of the August 7th Meeting and the formulation of the correct guideline for continuing the revolutionary struggle prevented the whole party from being panicked by the extremely severe white terror, rekindled the courage to fight against the reactionary elements of the Kuomintang, and made great contributions to saving the party and the revolution. From then on, the Chinese revolution underwent a historical transformation from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the land revolution war.
However, due to the influence of the "Left" ideology and the "Left" sentiment within the party caused by the Communist International and its representatives, the August 7th Meeting did not pay attention to preventing and correcting the "Left" error when opposing the rightist errors. There was a lack of understanding of the need for the party to organize necessary retreats in a situation of a low tide in the revolution, allowing and promoting tendencies toward blindly launching worker strikes and organizing urban riots. The meeting did not notify Chen Duxiu to attend and only blamed the leaders who made mistakes, without emphasizing the serious summary of the ideological and theoretical lessons learned from these mistakes. The meeting also inappropriately emphasized the significance of the pure working-class composition of the party's leadership bodies and party members. The meeting believed that the completion of the democratic revolution against the feudal system (including the land revolution) and especially the struggle against imperialism must be achieved within the struggle against the already counterrevolutionary bourgeoisie. This understanding provided the theoretical basis for the later development of "Left" errors and caused great harm to the Chinese revolution.
After the August 7th Meeting, armed uprisings broke out successively in various regions. After the armed uprisings, the establishment of what kind of political power became an urgent problem that the CPC Central Committee needed to solve. In the resolutions adopted by the August 7th Meeting, titled "Resolution on Recent Peasant Struggles" and "Resolution on Recent Worker Movements," the slogan "rural power belongs to the peasant association" and the goal of achieving "dictatorship of the workers and peasants" were proposed. On August 9th, in an instructive letter to the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, the Central Temporary Political Bureau explicitly proposed the establishment of a revolutionary government based on the dictatorship of the workers and peasants, specifically: all power in the countryside belongs to the peasant association, all power in the city belongs to the revolutionary committee; after the victory of the revolutionary committee, it should convene a meeting of representatives of trade unions, peasant associations, and revolutionary small business owners to establish a formal "people's power government."As for when such a "civil rights government" can be organized, the directive believes it should be determined after the local revolutionary committee's power is consolidated. 
At this time, although the CCP Central Committee has determined the policy of establishing a democratic regime of workers and peasants, it still proposed organizing workers and peasants' uprisings under the banner of the revolutionary left of the Kuomintang. The CCP Central Committee believes that the Kuomintang is a special banner of the national liberation movement, and Communist Party members have joined it and have always been the center of the left wing of the Kuomintang. The actions and propaganda of the grassroots organizations and party members of the Communist Party have earned the revolutionary credibility of the Kuomintang among urban petty bourgeoisie and even some workers. The Communist Party should not abandon this banner now. At the same time, organizing uprisings under the banner of the Kuomintang can attract revolutionary elements of the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, the slogan of organizing Soviets should not be proposed at this time.
More than a month later, on September 19th, the Central Temporary Political Bureau meeting passed a resolution based on changes in the situation, abandoning the banner of the "left Kuomintang" and proposing slogans for propaganda and establishing Soviets.
II The proposal of the nature of the Chinese revolution and the path of the revolution
At the time of the failure of the national revolution and the launch of the land revolution, the Communist Party of China, while summarizing the lessons of the revolution's failure, re-explored the various fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution, including social nature, revolutionary nature, revolutionary force and class relations, the content and main methods of revolution, revolutionary regime, revolutionary prospects, and revolutionary path. This is the work that must be carried out after the climax of the revolution. The core of these issues is the nature of the revolution and the path of the revolution.
Regarding the social nature, understanding the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society is the basis for understanding the various fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution. Among Chinese Communists and early Marxists, Cai Hesen was the first to clearly use the term "semi-colonial" to describe the nature of Chinese society. In September 1922, he pointed out in an article titled "Unity, Debt, and the Kuomintang", "China has long been in a semi-colonial status in terms of international position." After the Fourth Congress of the Communist International reiterated that China is a "semi-colonial country", concepts such as "semi-colonized China", "semi-colonial society", and "semi-colonial Chinese society" were widely used in documents of the Chinese Communist Party and the works of Marxist theorists. Cai Hesen was also the first to use the concept of "semi-feudal" among Chinese Communists and early Marxists. In September 1922, in an article titled "Forced Unification and Autonomy: Warlord Dictatorship and Warlord Separatism", he pointed out that China at that time belonged to a "semi-feudal and semi-democratic situation." In September 1924, Cai Hesen in an article titled "Anatomy of the Fengtian Reactionary Movement" already mentioned "semi-bourgeois and semi-feudal society," but without specific argument and explanation. It was the "Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China" that clearly stated the semi-feudal nature of China's economy and society. The "Resolutions on the Land Question" passed by the "Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party" clearly pointed out, "The economic and land relationship characteristics of China are obviously a semi-feudal system," and "The current economic and political system in China should indeed be defined as a semi-feudal system."Based on a clear understanding of the aspects of "semi-colonial" and "semi-feudal", in February 1929, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used the complete concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal" for the first time in the "Notice No. 28 of the Central Committee on the Strategy of the Peasant Movement". The document pointed out: "Based on the socio-economic relations of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society and the valuable experience of the peasants in recent years, the Sixth Congress pointed out the route of the peasant movement. Its main spirit is to strive for the unity of the broad masses of peasants to establish the united front of the anti-landlord class in the rural areas, consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the peasant revolutionary struggle, and ensure the victory of the land revolution to transform into the socialist future."
Although the "Sixth Congress" of the CCP had a clear understanding of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society, the concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal" was not yet used. In summarizing the basic spirit of the "Sixth Congress" on the peasant movement, the "Notice No. 28 of the Central Committee" explicitly used the concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal" for the first time in the CCP's documents. In previous related articles, there were few mentions of this document, which led to many debates on the timing of the introduction of the concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal". After the start of the great debates in the 1930s, various different views on the nature of Chinese society were put forward. After discussions, it was Su Hua and Zhang Wentian who were the earliest to reassess Chinese society as a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. In September 1933, Su Hua pointed out in the article "The Development of Capitalist Economy in China" that the current Chinese society is a "semi-colonial semi-feudal society", with emphasis on "semi-feudal society", and "semi-colonial" is used to describe the "feudal society". In January 1934, Zhang Wentian made a convincing conclusion in the article "The Social and Economic Basis of the Chinese Revolution" by focusing on the issue of land relations in China, stating that the economic nature of Chinese society is "semi-colonial and semi-feudal", and further pointed out: "This kind of economy determines the tasks and nature of the Chinese revolution, the relations between the various classes in the Chinese revolution, and the driving force of the Chinese revolution." After that, in June 1934, Lv Zhenyu clearly stated in "Research on Prehistoric Chinese Society" that Chinese society became a "semi-colonial semi-feudal society" after the Opium War. These statements represent the views of the Chinese Communist Party at that time. By the first half of the 1930s, after the debates on the nature of Chinese society, the understanding of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society further deepened and gradually became standardized. In December 1936, Mao Zedong began to use the concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal". In his article "The Strategic Issues of the Chinese Revolution War," he pointed out, "We are now engaged in war, our war is a revolutionary war, and our revolutionary war is conducted in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal country of China." This shows that Mao Zedong agreed with the terminology of Marxist theoreticians at that time.
Regarding the revolutionary nature, in his speech "On China" at the Joint Meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on August 1, 1927, Stalin pointed out that the Chinese revolution has three stages: "The first stage is the revolutionary united front of the entire nation, which was the Guangzhou period. At that time, the main goal of the revolution was to combat foreign imperialism, and the national bourgeoisie supported the revolutionary movement; the second stage is the bourgeois-democratic revolution, that is, after the National Revolutionary Army reached the Yangtze River, the national bourgeoisie withdrew from the revolution, and the land movement developed into a powerful revolution of millions of peasants (today's China is in the second stage of its development); the third stage is the Soviet revolution, which has not yet arrived, but it is coming." In the resolution "On the Chinese Question" adopted by the Executive Committee of the Communist International on February 25, 1928, it explicitly stated, "The present stage of the Chinese revolution is the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution."
At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party in 1937, it was pointed out that "the Chinese revolution is still in the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, which opposes the oppression of imperialism and the remnants of the feudal system in all socio-economic and political aspects." On April 30, 1928, the "Announcement of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party on the Resolution of the Communist International" stated: "The Central Political Bureau has always clearly recognized that the Chinese revolution is still a bourgeois democratic revolution." The "Sixth National Congress" of the Communist Party further emphasized that "the current stage of the Chinese revolution is a bourgeois democratic revolution", because the "current goal" of the revolution is to "expel imperialists and achieve true unity of China. Thoroughly overthrow the landlord class' system of private land ownership and carry out land revolution... completely destroying all semi-feudal constraints within the land system." Many Communist Party members, such as Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, have explicitly pointed out in their writings that "the current stage of the Chinese revolution is a bourgeois democratic revolution." Communists recognize that the Chinese revolution still belongs to the bourgeois democratic revolution, but also point out the "specificity" of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution. Firstly, China's bourgeois democratic revolution not only opposes imperialism and feudalism, but also opposes the national bourgeoisie. The political resolution of the Communist Party's "Sixth National Congress" states: "The current bourgeois democratic revolution in China must first counter the national bourgeoisie in order to succeed", because the national bourgeoisie is one of the most dangerous enemies hindering the success of the revolution. The political resolution of the 6th Congress of the Communist International also states: "With the expansion of mass mobilization and the deepening of the land revolution, the national bourgeoisie gradually joins the counter-revolution. Therefore, China's anti-imperialist struggle cannot be separated from the struggle against the bourgeoisie and the land revolution." Communists believe that "China's national bourgeoisie is intimately connected with feudal landlord land ownership and shamelessly surrenders to imperialism", although "the Chinese national bourgeoisie is in conflict with imperialism economically, fundamentally it contradicts the interests of the majority of the Chinese working class and peasants", "the Chinese bourgeoisie cannot seek compensation from imperialism by resisting it, but it can only intensify the exploitation of Chinese workers and peasants." Therefore, the Chinese revolution must oppose the national bourgeoisie. After the failure of the Great Revolution, for a considerable period of time, the Communists, from a class standpoint and with hatred against the national bourgeoisie for betraying the revolution, raised slogans against the national bourgeoisie based on their political attitude of opposing the communist-led land revolution. However, most Communists still understand that opposing the bourgeoisie "is not because the national bourgeoisie represents capitalism and therefore should be opposed, but because the national bourgeoisie has become a tool of imperialism and an ally of the landlord class, betraying the revolution and becoming the leader of counter-revolution against the democratic revolution. Therefore, this new task does not go beyond the nature of the bourgeois democratic revolution and will not destroy the capitalist mode of production, but objectively serves as the starting point for the development of capitalism." 
Secondly, China's bourgeois democratic revolution is part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. Cai Hesen once pointed out that China's bourgeois democratic revolution "opposes international imperialism, forms one force of the world revolution and is part of the world revolution." The Communist International's "Sixth Congress" believes that "the Chinese revolution has great significance for the world." The political resolution of the 6th National Congress of the CPC states that "the bourgeois democratic revolution in China, by opposing imperialism and weakening its strength, will also reduce the violence of imperialism against the Soviet Union and the working class of various countries. This is a help for the future of the world proletarian revolution." "It is a force for the world socialist revolution, and it is also one of its main components." 
Thirdly, the bourgeois democratic revolution in China must be led by the proletariat, in alliance with the broad masses, mainly peasants. "The Chinese working class, because of objective conditions, is the most determined, most thorough, and least compromising class in the struggle for Chinese national liberation. This situation makes the Chinese proletariat entitled to the leadership in the national liberation movement." Mao Zedong pointed out in 'Why Can the Red Regime of China Exist?' that 'China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, which must be led by the proletariat to be achieved.' Qu Qiubai pointed out, 'The development of the Chinese revolution, based on its class foundation, is bound to be a revolution led by the proletariat, rural soldiers, poor and working masses, overthrowing the reactionary landlords, domestic bourgeoisie, and international imperialist bourgeoisie.' Cai Hesen emphasized that due to the betrayal of the national bourgeoisie to the revolution, the 'leadership of the proletariat' was further established. The 'central issue of the Chinese revolution' can only be completely victorious 'under the condition of uniting with farmers...'
Fourthly, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution has a non-capitalist future. In February 1927, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Executive Committee of the Communist International pointed out in the resolution on the Chinese revolutionary question that the development of the Chinese revolution has a non-capitalist (socialist) future. This point was also explicitly stated in the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party. Some communists pointed out, 'The particularity of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution lies in the fact that its victory will open up the path for socialist development.' Why does the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution have a non-capitalist future? Communists have provided answers from different perspectives. 'The motive force for the Chinese revolution is now only the proletariat and the peasants, and the leadership of the proletariat can be established during the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution (the proletariat can help and guide the peasants in carrying out land reform and leading the struggle against imperialism), so this can pave the way for the future development of the Chinese revolution, giving it a non-capitalist future, i.e. a socialist future. The world capitalist system is currently in a period of panic, and the socialist construction of the proletarian dictatorship—the Soviet Union—has grown in political and economic power over the past ten years, which is sufficient to help the Chinese proletariat strive for the socialist future of the revolution and ensure the possibility of victory.' 'The crisis in Chinese industry and agriculture necessitates transitional measures towards socialism,' such as the expropriation of foreign capital by the Soviet government, 'and then the expropriation of all major domestic enterprises to organize and direct the national economic life under the leadership of the urban industrial sector owned by the state.' Moreover, due to 'the low productivity of agriculture, when the land revolution is completely victorious and the development towards capitalism begins, there will inevitably be a major obstacle, which is the resistance of imperialism, the landlord bourgeoisie, and the rich peasants who have been hit by the revolution.' To overcome these obstacles, the only choice for peasants (excluding the rich peasants) is to 'quickly prepare for the conditions of transitioning to the socialist revolution, namely, to eliminate the capitalist market economy and replace it with an organized collective economy in the rural areas under the control of large-scale industry owned by the state. When this transformation takes place, it will no longer mark the start of capitalist development, but rather the initial stage of socialist construction.' The non-capitalist future of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution is the consensus of the vast majority of communists. However, there are serious disagreements regarding the timing of the transformation of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. The Communist Party had a roundabout understanding of this issue. The enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party held in November 1927 believed that the Chinese revolution is a 'continuous revolution' that 'must completely solve the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution and swiftly advance to the path of socialism.' Qu Qiubai further developed the concept of this 'continuous revolution' as it 'cannot but exceed the scope of bourgeois democratic revolution.' He even believed that 'the current stage of the Chinese revolution has already grown into a socialist revolution.' The Communist International, the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party, and some communists criticized this view, pointing out that the transformation to the socialist revolution can only begin 'under the conditions of the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution' and it is absolutely impossible to 'skip over the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution.' At the same time, it was emphasized that 'the end of the bourgeois democratic revolution is also the beginning of the resolute struggle for the socialist revolution,' and there is no room for the development of capitalism between the two."
After the 87th Meeting, the Communist Party of China took leadership in the uprising and initiated armed struggle, which led to a transformation in the form of struggle. However, at this time, the CPC Central Committee did not realize that the revolutionary situation had entered a low tide. Instead, they made a mistake in assessing the situation and blindly demanded armed uprisings in certain areas, disregarding both subjective and objective conditions. As a result, the "leftist" sentiment within the party gradually grew.
III. During the lengthy period after the zigzag exploration of the fundamental issues of the Chinese Revolution in 1927, many comrades still placed the central task of the party on preparing urban uprisings and working in areas controlled by the Kuomintang. Each time, the "leftist" errors were repeatedly made in this regard. Their historical lesson from these mistakes was that they did not start from the actual conditions of the Chinese Revolution, did not investigate or study the historical and social conditions of China, but instead sat in big cities and mechanically adhered to dogma, blindly copying foreign experiences. Although they had some superficial knowledge, they could not ultimately develop the wisdom to relate theory to the specific conditions in China. Therefore, they underestimated the importance of military struggle, especially guerrilla warfare and rural base areas, and attacked the theory of the "encirclement of cities by rural areas." They held the so-called "local and conservative ideas of rural consciousness" and always dreamed that the struggles of urban workers and other masses could suddenly break the enemy's oppression and prosper. They constantly hoped to launch armed uprisings in major cities as a means to achieve so-called first victories in one or more provinces, leading to a nationwide revolutionary upsurge and victory. They made this dream of theirs the centerpiece of all their work arrangements.
This "leftist" error blindly copied and emulated the experience of the Russian Revolution. Under the guidance of the "leftist" theory of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the CPC held an expanded meeting of the Political Bureau in Shanghai on September 9-10, 1927. The meeting, presided over by Qu Qiubai and with the participation of the Communist International representative Nikolai Bukharin, passed the resolution drafted by Bukharin titled "Resolution on the Current Situation and the Party's Tasks in China," as well as resolutions on organizational issues and political discipline. On the one hand, the resolutions correctly called for all revolutionary forces to firmly oppose imperialism, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang under the leadership of the Communist Party, and firmly lead peasant uprisings and establish rural bases. They advocated the redistribution of land owned by the landlord class to the peasants and the organization of a revolutionary army of workers and peasants to engage in guerrilla warfare, and so on. However, on the other hand, they believed that the Chinese Revolution was a so-called "uninterrupted revolution" and that "the current revolutionary struggle must inevitably go beyond the scope of bourgeois democracy and progress rapidly," leading to a sudden transition onto the path of socialism upon the complete resolution of tasks regarding bourgeois democracy. This resulted in a blurring of the boundary between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. 
The meeting accepted Bukharin's "leftist" viewpoint, believing that Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal represented the entire national bourgeoisie's betrayal, and that Wang Jingwei's betrayal represented the betrayal of the petty bourgeoisie. Consequently, they proposed that, in addition to opposing imperialism and feudalism, they must also oppose the national bourgeoisie and the upper stratum of the petty bourgeoisie. The meeting did not acknowledge that the revolutionary situation was in a low tide. They believed that the rule of the new warlords of the Kuomintang was on the verge of collapse, and that the current situation in China was one of immediate revolution. Based on this, the meeting established a comprehensive strategy of conducting a nationwide armed uprising and demanded the combination of rural uprisings with urban uprisings, with urban uprisings as the "center and guide," forming a total armed uprising in both rural and urban areas, until a revolutionary victory was achieved in one or more provinces. The meeting also established a series of excessively "leftist" policies, such as advocating the seizure of enterprises owned by Chinese and foreign capitalists, and placing factories under the control of workers. It demanded "extremely severe and ruthless killing of landlords and counterrevolutionary forces" during peasant uprisings, and so on.
According to Romaine's proposal, the conference did not conduct a specific analysis of the failures and setbacks suffered by armed uprisings in various places after the 8-7 Conference. Instead, it unilaterally accused the leaders of the uprising of "hesitation and vacillation," "contravening central policies," and committing "opportunistic" mistakes. It also decided to impose different political disciplinary actions on the leaders of the Nanchang Uprising and the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Region, as well as relevant provincial committee officials such as Zhou Enlai, Tan Pingshan, Mao Zedong, and Peng Gongda. Along with affirming the organizational progress made since the 8-7 Conference, this expanded conference also made the guiding ideology of the Party organs and the proletarianization of Party members more precise. The adopted Resolution on the Significant Tasks regarding Recent Organizational Issues stated that one of the Party's main shortcomings in terms of organization was that the Party's leading cadres were not workers, and even not poor peasants, but rather representatives of the petite bourgeoisie intellectuals. It pointed out that this was the "source" of opportunism within the Party. In response, the resolution proposed that the Party's most important organizational task was to replace the non-proletarian intellectual cadres with new cadres from the working class and peasants, and to ensure that the proletarian and poor masses accounted for the majority of the Party's guiding cadres. The conference demanded a thorough transformation of the Party's leading organs before the Sixth Party Congress. From mid-November to mid-December, the spirit of the expanded meeting of the Central Temporary Political Bureau began to be implemented in various places. Some areas experienced forced strikes by workers, peasant uprisings, blind killings, and other situations, which temporarily alienated the Party from the masses in these areas. Only a few armed uprisings in rural areas achieved certain victories, while many were unsuccessful or not even launched. Strikes by a small number of workers and active individuals in major cities such as Wuhan, Changsha, and Shanghai were quickly suppressed. In late December, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by Qu Qiubai, considering that it was difficult to launch general uprisings everywhere, issued consecutive notices instructing some areas not to immediately call for uprisings if conditions were not ready. They also decided to halt the planned year-end uprisings in Hunan and Hubei, thus avoiding some losses and playing a certain role in correcting blind impulsive mistakes. However, at this time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China had not yet recognized the "left" error in terms of guiding ideology and overall strategy, so it was impossible to completely correct the blind impulsive mistakes with a broad impact. This "left" error occurred during the historical turning point from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the Agrarian Revolution. The main reason was the anger against the Kuomintang's policy of massacre, and there was a general mood of impatience and desperation within the Party. At the same time, some individuals who had committed right-wing errors, fearing a repeat of those errors, believed that "left" was better than right, thereby providing a breeding ground for the development of "left" mistakes. At that time, the Party was not yet able to make a correct analysis of the various urgent problems the Chinese revolution faced after the failure of the Great Revolution, nor find solutions. It also lacked experience in internal struggles and did not understand the need to guard against "left" errors while combating right-wing errors. Romaine, the representative of the Communist International, bore significant responsibility for the emergence of this "left" error. He was the main proponent and implementer of political blind impetuosity, punitive organizationalism, and other "left" policies. The Central Temporary Political Bureau, headed by Qu Qiubai, also had direct responsibility for this "left" error.
Li Lisan's line was also known as the "urban center theory." On January 11, 1930, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed the Resolution to Accept the Letter of Instructions of October 26, 1929, from the Communist International. On February 26, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued Announcement No. 70, which overestimated the revolutionary situation, believing that "at present, the national crisis is deepening, and a new wave of revolution is developing." It stated that the nationwide mass struggle was "moving towards a path of balanced development." Based on this estimation, the announcement stipulated that the Party's "current overall political line" should converge various struggles and "progress towards turning the warlord conflict into domestic class struggle to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and establish Soviet power."
The notice pointed out that the party's strategy is not to continue to accumulate strength during the period of revolution's ebb, but to implement a strategy of concentrating forces and actively attacking. Various regions should organize political strikes by workers, local riots, and mutinies, and concentrate the Red Army to attack major cities. In April and May, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission made specific plans and deployments for this. During this process, Li Lisan published multiple articles in party organs such as "Red Flag" and "Bolshevik" titled "Various Issues Before the New Revolutionary Upturn," putting forward a series of "leftist" views on the Chinese Revolution. After the outbreak of the Central Plains War and the Xiang-Gui Border War, Li Lisan and others believed that the revolutionary situation had matured nationwide. Therefore, at the Central Political Bureau Meeting convened in June 1930, it adopted the "Resolution on the Current Political Tasks" drafted by Li Lisan (i.e., "The New Revolutionary Upturn and Initial Victory in One or Several Provinces"). The resolution made incorrect estimates of the revolutionary situation, believing that "the fundamental crisis of China's economic and politics continues to sharpen in the same way everywhere in the country without any fundamental difference"; "the overall situation indicates that a new revolutionary upturn in China is approaching us," and "there is a great possibility of turning into a nationwide revolution." The resolution also believed that the "unprecedented world events and the timing of worldwide revolution are approaching us," and that once the Chinese revolution erupts, it will "trigger a worldwide revolution," and the Chinese revolution will achieve complete victory in this final decisive battle. Based on this erroneous assessment of the revolutionary situation, the resolution concluded that the party no longer needs to gradually accumulate and prepare its revolutionary strength because the masses already want to do big things instead of small ones, that is, they only want armed uprisings, and national armed uprisings at that. The resolution mechanically applied the experience of the Russian October Revolution, believing that as long as a great workers' struggle suddenly erupts in an industrial area or political center, immediate victory in one or several provinces can be achieved through armed uprisings, the establishment of a nationwide revolutionary regime, and the subsequent seizure of victory in all provinces and regions across the country. Although the resolution acknowledged that it is necessary to organize the Red Army in rural areas, it believed that the task of the Red Army is to coordinate with armed uprisings in major cities, seize power, and establish a nationwide revolutionary regime. Therefore, the "past guerrilla tactics" must be fundamentally changed. The resolution demanded the concentration and organization of the Red Army, unified command, and the implementation of large-scale offensive warfare. The resolution's view on the nature of the Chinese revolution and the issue of revolutionary transformation also regressed to the incorrect understanding of "continuous revolution" that had been criticized at the Party's Sixth National Congress. Although the resolution acknowledged that the current stage of the Chinese revolution is still primarily a bourgeois democratic revolution with anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks, it also stated that the "bourgeoisie has already become part of the reactionary alliance," and that if the revolution achieves initial victory in one or several provinces, it should not only confiscate banks, enterprises, and factories owned by imperialism in China, "but also confiscate factories, enterprises, and banks of the Chinese bourgeoisie"; at the same time, in political terms, it "inevitably needs to progress from proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants to proletarian dictatorship." 
The resolution pointed out: "The beginning of victory in the revolution, the beginning of the establishment of the revolutionary regime, is the beginning of revolutionary transformation"; "It is a serious mistake to think that the revolutionary transformation can only begin after the revolution achieves victory nationwide"; the stage theory of revolutionary transformation is "undoubtedly an extremely dangerous right-wing concept." Under the influence of the aforementioned erroneous thoughts, Li Lisan and others formulated a risky plan centered around a nationwide urban uprising in Wuhan and the concentrated attack by the nationwide Red Army on urban centers. In July, preparatory work for riots in cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan was emphasized. At the same time, it was stipulated that the Red Third Army would cut off the Wuhan-Changsha railway and advance towards Wuhan; the Red First Army would advance towards Nanchang and Jiujiang to cut off the Yangtze River and protect the victory in Wuhan; the Red Second Army and the Red First Army would cooperate with each other to advance towards Wuhan; and the Red Seventh Army would attack Liuzhou, Guilin, and Guangzhou. The Red Army in various regions immediately took military action according to the instructions of the central authorities and the military commission.
In late July, under the victorious situation of the Pingjiang counteroffensive, the Red Third Army captured Changsha on the 27th. Upon hearing this news, Li Lisan and others believed even more that the goal of "meeting in Wuhan," "drinking horses in the Yangtze River," and eventually achieving national victory could be realized soon. As a result, the "left" deviationist errors began to develop further. From early to mid-August, Li Lisan and others, under the slogan of "militarizing" the entire party organization, established the Central General Action Committee as the highest command body for leading armed uprisings. They merged the leading bodies of the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and the labor unions at all levels into action committees (referred to as "work committees"), suspending the normal activities of the party, youth league, and unions. They further proposed plans to initiate uprisings in Wuhan, Nanjing, and a general strike by the Shanghai Federation. They established the Central Soviet Government in Wuhan and detailed plans for a national uprising. They also suggested that the Soviet Union must actively prepare for war, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers in Siberia should quickly arm themselves to "prepare for combat against Japanese imperialism." They also proposed that when the Chinese uprising was victorious, Mongolia should send a large number of troops to attack the reactionary forces in northern China. Li Lisan and others called on the entire party to "move forward bravely, even more bravely." Thus, Li Lisan's "left" adventurist errors reached their peak.
Wang Ming's line is a typical dogmatic line. This is clearly reflected in the booklet "Two Lines" written by him. Although this booklet criticizes Li Lisan's "left" adventurist errors to some extent, Wang Ming believes that Li Lisan's errors are overall rightist, and that they are a right opportunist line disguised by "leftist" words and phrases. Li Lisan's errors are clearly "leftist," so why does Wang Ming instead think that they are rightist? This is mainly because many of Wang Ming's views are even more "leftist" than those of Li Lisan and others. He believes that the motive force of the Chinese revolution is only the workers, peasants, and lower petty bourgeoisie, and that all other classes and strata have "joined the reactionary camp." Therefore, there is no existence of a "third camp" or "middle camp." He equates the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie with imperialism and feudalism, considering them all as targets of the revolution. He proclaims that the current stage of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution can only achieve thorough victory through resolute struggle against the bourgeoisie. He emphasizes that a nationwide revolutionary upsurge has already arrived and advocates implementing an offensive line nationwide. He believes that "at present, we do not yet have a direct revolutionary situation in all of China, but under the conditions of the growing and uneven development of the nationwide revolutionary movement, the direct revolutionary situation can initially include one or several major provinces." He advocates that in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, a "genuine achievement of victory in one or several provinces should be realized first and then expanded to strive for victory nationwide." Li Lisan advocates that the Chinese revolution should be primarily based on urban workers' uprisings, and Wang Ming also insists on the centrality of the cities. He proposes, in accordance with the resolutions of the Comintern, that "the most reliable indicator of a new revolutionary movement that is maturing in China, that a new upsurge is developing, is the climax of workers' strike struggles." He advocates organizing and leading the economic struggles of the working class, being genuinely prepared for a general strike and even armed uprisings, as the most important tasks of the Communist Party. Although Wang Ming also expresses the importance of the strength of the Red Army, he completely fails to understand the laws of Red Army combat and the development of revolutionary base areas in a situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak. He accuses the party and the Red Army of not yet being able to establish a most secure revolutionary center base by the winter of 1930, regarding this as the true rightist tendency that needs to be opposed. Regarding the land revolution issue, Wang Ming puts forward "resolutely striking the rich peasants" and "ensuring that the rich peasants receive relatively inferior land" and other "leftist" propositions. In terms of organization, he demands that "struggle cadres who actively support and implement the international line—especially worker cadre—be used to transform and reinforce the leading bodies at all levels." The booklet "Two Lines" is actually Wang Ming's political program of "left" dogmatism.
The Chinese Communist Party made three "left" errors during the period from winter 1927 to January 1935, before the Zunyi Conference. One of their common characteristics was focusing on urban centers. Why were these errors not fundamentally corrected and instead repeated? One of the fundamental reasons was an incorrect ideological line. The ideological line forms the basis of the political line. With an incorrect ideological line, it is impossible to formulate a correct political line. Particularly, Wang Ming did not start from China's actual conditions. He treated dogma as an inviolable treasure and followed the book everywhere, considering only the instructions from the Communist International. As there was no experience in the international communist movement of a rural revolution surrounding and capturing cities, they believed that the Chinese revolution must also focus on cities. Their logic was: because the proletariat in foreign countries achieved victory through urban armed uprisings and because the Chinese revolution was also led by the proletariat, and since the proletariat is always connected to cities, the party should focus on the countryside rather than cities, then it would be "rejecting cities" and denying that the Communist Party is a proletarian party and denying the proletariat's leadership over the peasants. As a result, the party would become a petty-bourgeois peasant party. At that time, the Party Central Committee was always worried that focusing on the countryside would be too far away from the cities and would not receive the leadership of cities, which meant there would be no proletarian leadership. Starting from this erroneous understanding, they one-sidedly emphasized that urban armed uprisings were the main sign of promoting a nationwide revolutionary upsurge. They repeatedly demanded that the work in various Soviet areas "should change from purely rural to important cities" and shifted the focus to cities. This neglect of using the countryside as a revolutionary base clearly does not suit China's situation.
Marxism believes that there are common basic laws in the development of human society, and denying these basic laws is incorrect. However, different countries and ethnicities have different historical conditions and characteristics. If we do not start from our own country's actual conditions and the characteristics of our own revolution and apply the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in a concrete manner, it is also impossible to guide the revolution to victory. The most fundamental historical lesson of the three "left" errors lies in this. The entire historical experience of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly proves a truth: whenever they deviate from the ideological line of dialectical materialism, the political line will be erroneous and the revolutionary cause will be harmed; whenever they adhere to the ideological line of dialectical materialism, they will formulate a political line that conforms to China's actual conditions, and the revolutionary cause will continue to develop.
Chapter Three
Elaboration of the theory of New Democracy
Section 1. Preliminary formation of the theory system of New Democracy
I. Proposal for the Sinicization of Marxism
During the period of the Great Revolution and the Land Revolution War, the Chinese Communist Party guided the Chinese revolution with Marxist-Leninist principles, and with the assistance of the Communist International, achieved significant victories. However, at the same time, there were significant mistakes in the integration of Marxist-Leninist principles with the actual Chinese revolution. Especially from 1931 to 1934, the "leftist" dogmatists represented by Wang Ming emphasized formulas instead of applying basic Marxist-Leninist principles based on the specific conditions of the Chinese revolution. They blindly followed the instructions of the Communist International, regarding the so-called international line as the absolute standard, and as a criterion for evaluating all theories and practical work.As a result, the party's work in the white areas was first disrupted, followed by the failure of the Red Army's war, which once again caused a serious setback to the Chinese revolution. The rise and fall of the revolutionary cause made the Communist Party of China deeply aware of the importance of integrating theory with practice and applying foreign experiences and instructions from the Communist International according to the country's own conditions. Mao Zedong's works such as "Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War", "On Practice", and "On Contradiction" demonstrated the correct ideological line reaffirmed by the party central committee. However, Wang Ming, who returned from the Soviet Union to China after the outbreak of the war of resistance, repeated the mistake of deviating from China's actual conditions and blindly copying foreign experiences and instructions, but in a different way, he went from being "left" to being right. 
At that time, the Communist International and the Soviet Union actively supported the Chinese people's war of resistance, but they once again overestimated the strength of the Kuomintang and underestimated the strength of the Communist Party of China. They mistakenly believed that only Chiang Kai-shek's army could contain and strike at Japanese imperialism on the Chinese battlefield. They advocated that the Communist Party should accommodate and make more concessions to the Kuomintang, disagreed with the Communist Party's insistence on the principles of independent autonomy and unity and struggle in the united front, and proposed "everything through the anti-Japanese national united front" and "everything through the anti-Japanese national united front". They only focused on the regular warfare and positional warfare of the Kuomintang army, ignoring the role of the Communist Party-led guerrilla war against Japan. Wang Ming used these views as the basis for observing the issue of China's resistance to Japan and tried his best to implement them, thus forming a new right-leaning error under new historical conditions. Wang Ming claimed that both the Communist Party and the Kuomintang were "the general convergence of a large part of outstanding progressive young people in China" and that Chiang Kai-shek would "become the immortal national hero of China". He advocated "everything through the united front" and "everything follows the united front", did not support the emphasis on the principle of "independence and autonomy", and opposed raising the issue of leadership in the united front. He looked down upon the people's army and guerrilla warfare led by the Communist Party, ignored the work in the anti-Japanese base areas, and pinned the hope of winning the war of resistance on the regular warfare of the Kuomintang army. He advocated implementing the strategic policy of "mainly focusing on mobile warfare supplemented by guerrilla warfare and coordination with positional warfare". He even proposed to unify the Communist Party-led army with the Kuomintang army in terms of organizational structure, armament, discipline, treatment, command, operational plans, and actions. Because Wang Ming continued to use the banner of the "Communist International", his erroneous views still had a certain degree of confusing power and were implemented in some areas, causing certain losses to the cause of the war of resistance and the development of the revolutionary forces. The Six Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held from the end of September to the beginning of November 1938, basically overcame Wang Ming's right-leaning errors. It was precisely at this session that the Communist Party of China, based on its 17 years of experience and lessons since its founding, clearly put forward the task of "making Marxism concrete in China". 
In the thematic report "On the New Stage" made by Mao Zedong at the conference, there was a special section discussing the issue of "learning". He pointed out: "If a political party that guides a great revolutionary movement does not have revolutionary theory, historical knowledge, and a profound understanding of the practical movement, it is impossible to achieve victory." Therefore, he put forward corresponding tasks for learning in three aspects: learning Marxist theory, studying the historical heritage, and researching the current practical movement. Regarding the first task, he said: "We are leading a great struggle of hundreds of millions of people of a large nation. Therefore, the universal and in-depth study of the theory of Marxism-Leninism is a pressing and important problem that needs to be solved and needs to be devoted to. Mao Zedong called for a "learning competition for the entire party to see who has truly learned something, and who has learned a little more, and a little better". 
However, in order to study Marxist theory, one must first solve an attitude problem.What attitude should be adopted in order to be correct? Mao Zedong believed that the theory of Marxism-Leninism should not be regarded as dogma, but rather as a guide for action. It should not only be studied in terms of its words and phrases, but also as a scientific study of revolution. One should not only understand its general conclusions on laws, but also learn from it the standpoint and methods for observing and solving problems. It is particularly important to "learn how to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions in China" and "apply it according to the characteristics of China", because "Marxism must be combined with the specific characteristics of our country and realized through certain national forms", and "talking about Marxism without considering China's characteristics is just abstract and empty Marxism." Therefore, it is "an urgent problem for the entire Party to understand and solve" to make Marxism concrete in China and ensure that it carries the necessary Chinese characteristics in its every manifestation. Mao Zedong pointed out sharply and sternly that "the old-style writing must be abolished, empty and abstract tunes must be sung less, dogmatism must be put to rest, and instead, fresh and lively Chinese style and Chinese characteristics that are welcomed by the Chinese people must be embraced." These statements by Mao Zedong, following "On Practice" and "On Contradiction", more clearly point out the attitude that Chinese Communists should adopt towards Marxism and the guidance given by the Communist International. Only by "making Marxism concrete in China" can they conform to the fundamental spirit of Marxism.
Zhang Wentian expressed the same views as Mao Zedong in his report "On the Anti-Japanese National United Front and Party Organizational Issues" to the Plenary Session. He believed that "the principles and methods of Marxism are international, but we are doing organizational work in China, so we must strictly take into account the characteristics of Chinese politics, economy, culture, thought, national customs, and morality, and correctly understand these characteristics before deciding on our forms of struggle, organizational forms, and work methods." "We must localize our organizational work" and "realize Marxist principles in the national environment." "It is bound to meet with obstacles if we try to transplant decisions made by foreign parties to China." The resolution of the Party's Sixth Plenary Session called on the entire Party to "learn to flexibly apply Marxism-Leninism and international experience to every practical struggle in China."
Applying the principles of Marxism according to the characteristics of China, and making Marxism concrete in China, is a sublimation of the understanding reached by Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, after a difficult and tortuous journey. This sublimation goes beyond the general summary of revolutionary experience and proposes the most basic principles for guiding the Chinese revolution. The clear articulation of this principle throughout the Party indicates that the ideological thinking of the Chinese Communist Party has entered a mature stage, providing the most favorable internal conditions for the ultimate formation of the theory system of new democratic revolution. In the process, the external conditions have also gradually been met.
II. The Elaboration of the Theory of New Democracy
After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party of China emerged from its previously tightly sealed narrow space and became a nationwide large party, openly entering the national political stage and attracting increasing attention from the people. They yearned to understand the Communist Party's views on the current situation and the future prospects of China. The Communist Party of China, while insisting on independence and autonomy within the anti-Japanese national united front, also had to clearly put forward its own political proposition that distinguished it from other political parties in front of the entire people, attracting them to rally under its banner.
After the start of the nationwide anti-Japanese war, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party engaged in a fierce debate over the Three Principles of the People.The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have just reached a cooperation agreement. Chiang Kai-shek proposed in the "Talk on the Manifesto of the Communist Party" that the Three Principles of the People are the "principle of founding a nation in China" and the "only direction of effort in China today", namely the Three Principles of the People. In early 1938, the reactionary faction of the Kuomintang launched propaganda activities in Wuhan advocating "one doctrine", "one party", and "one leader". Newspapers controlled by the Kuomintang, such as "Sweeping Daily", published numerous articles attacking the Communist Party of China and Marxism. The loyalist literati of the Kuomintang clamored, "The Kuomintang is the favorite child among all parties. Other parties cannot talk to it on equal terms." Whether it is today or in the future, there is "no reason for independent existence."
After entering the stalemate stage of the War of Resistance, this propaganda became more intense. In December 1938, Zhang Junli of the National Socialist Party published an open letter to Mr. Mao Zedong, advocating the cancellation of the border areas, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army, and also wanted to discuss the "theory of the Communist Party" with Mao Zedong. He wrote in a threatening manner, "I think that in the current stage, since Mr. and others are striving for the external national war, it is better to temporarily put aside Marxism and let the thinking of the people in China clearly distinguish between right and wrong, without resorting to ambiguous and disguised words. If this can be achieved, the various ideological factions in the country, starting from the point of saving the nation and the country, will naturally approach each other easily." Ye Qing (Ren Zhuoxuan), a traitor of the Communist Party of China and a self-proclaimed "theorist" of the Kuomintang, openly advocated, "The Three Principles of the People can meet all the current and future requirements of China. If it is realized, China will no longer need socialism, and it will not be necessary to organize a party to fight for socialism." He also said: All parties outside the Kuomintang have no reason for independent existence, not only today, but also in the future. In January 1939, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a report entitled "Awakening the Party's Spirit, Promoting Party Conduct, and Consolidating the Party Base" at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Fifth Central Committee, and gave a speech entitled "Key Points for Sorting Out Party Affairs". The so-called "awakening the party's spirit" and "promoting party conduct" means implementing totalitarianism of "one doctrine", "one party", and "one leader". Chiang Kai-shek used the need for the war of resistance as an excuse, claiming that the people would not exercise civil rights and that "constitutional government" could not be implemented at present, so only "military governance" under "military law" could be implemented. He emphasized that the Kuomintang should "manage everything" and implement "governing the country with the party" and "building the country with the party". In September, he published a long article entitled "System and Implementation Procedures of the Three Principles of the People", advocating so-called "governing the country with the party" and "building the country with the party", and "the day of victory in the war of resistance will be the day of the completion of the country's establishment." This brings the question of "Where is China heading?" to the forefront of everyone who cares about the fate of the country, demanding that the Communist Party of China systematically state its position and views on this issue. Some representatives of the national bourgeoisie, although dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's dictatorial rule and its inadequate resistance to Japan, also have doubts about the Communist Party's proposals and the future of the anti-Japanese war. Some people even attempt to take a different path outside the political propositions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, wishing to establish a bourgeois republic in China based on Western standards.
Therefore, answering the question of where China is heading has become a significant theoretical issue. Mao Zedong, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of the CPC Central Committee, as well as the theoretical circles in Yan'an, responded to the Kuomintang's reactionary attacks on Marxism and the Communist Party of China through a series of articles and speeches, effectively exposing and criticizing various false interpretations of the Three Principles of the People. They discussed the differences between Sun Yat-sen's new Three Principles of the People and the old Three Principles of the People, as well as the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and communism, thus clarifying the theory and program of the Communist Party of China and answering the question of where China is heading.
Mao Zedong vigorously refuted the fallacy of "acknowledging the Three Principles of the People means giving up communism". He analyzed the historical development of the Three Principles of the People, compared the similarities and differences between the Three Principles of the People and communism, and pointed out that the revolutionary Three Principles of the People reinterpreted by Sun Yat-sen are consistent with the basic points of the Communist Party's program of the new democratic revolution, the New Democracy. Therefore, the Communist Party recognizes the Three Principles of the People as the political foundation of the anti-Japanese national united front.However, there are also differences between the two. They are two ideological systems guided by different worldviews. In certain specific policies at this stage, they are not completely the same. The thoroughness of the revolution is different, and the prospects of the revolution are also different. That is, after the completion of the new democratic revolution, there is still a highest program of establishing a socialist and communist social system, which the three principles of the people do not have. Ignoring this difference is wrong. The stubborn faction's demand for the Communist Party to "put away" communism is not only unreasonable, but also shows that their so-called three principles of the people are not Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary three principles of the people, but counterfeit three principles of the people. Their clamor for "one principle" actually denies the united front, denies the position of the Communist Party and the masses of workers and peasants, and insists on the autocracy of "one-party dictatorship". This kind of retrograde is fundamentally untenable. Mao Zedong stated that the Communist Party will always cooperate for a long time with all sincere Three Principles of the People without abandoning any friends.
The debate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on the three principles of the people further clarified the nature of Chinese society and the characteristics of historical development, further clarified the nature, tasks, and basic strategic policies of the Chinese revolution, and promoted the formation of the Communist Party of China's new democratic theoretical system.
The Communist Party of China regards the War of Resistance Against Japan as a stage of the Chinese revolution for new democracy. In carrying out the War of Resistance Against Japan, we must not only expel the Japanese aggressors but also create conditions for building a new China. In order to explain the party's overall understanding of the Chinese revolution and the building of new China to the entire party and the people of the country, Mao Zedong conducted a large amount of theoretical research work in Yan'an and concentrated the collective wisdom of the whole party to systematically summarize the experience of the Chinese revolution.
In an article titled "The May Fourth Movement" published by Mao Zedong on May 1, 1939, he had already said: "Twenty years ago, the May Fourth Movement represented the development of China's bourgeois democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism to a new stage." "The completion of the Chinese democratic revolution relies on certain social forces. These social forces are: the working class, the peasantry, the intellectuals, and the progressive bourgeoisie, that is, the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businessmen of the revolution. The fundamental revolutionary force is the workers and peasants, and the leading class of the revolution is the working class. Without this fundamental revolutionary force and without the leadership of the working class, it is impossible to accomplish the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution." In his speech "The Direction of the Youth Movement" on May 4, he referred to the ongoing Chinese revolution as "the people's democratic revolution in China against imperialism and feudalism." He said: "This revolution, the bourgeoisie is no longer able to complete, it must rely on the efforts of the proletariat and the masses of the people to complete it." After overthrowing imperialism and feudalism, it has to "establish a people's democratic republic" and "establish a people's democratic system." "It is different from the current semi-colonial and semi-feudal state, and it is also different from the future socialist system." But there is no doubt that "China will definitely develop into socialism in the future, and this law cannot be overturned by anyone."
In these two articles, Mao Zedong has already clearly stated that China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, starting from the May Fourth Movement, has developed to a new stage and needs to be led by the working class. It wants to establish a people's democratic republic that is neither the same as the semi-colonial and semi-feudal state nor the same as the socialist system, and it will develop into socialism in the future.Obviously, Mao Zedong's theory of New Democracy was already in the process of brewing, contemplating, and forming at this time. However, the clear concept of "New Democracy" had not been proposed yet, nor had there been sufficient time for systematic argumentation and explanation.
The scientific concept of New Democracy was first proposed in the book "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," which was written in December 1939. This textbook was a collaborative effort between Mao Zedong and several other comrades in Yan'an. Mao Zedong wrote the second chapter, "Chinese Revolution," while the first chapter, "Chinese Society," was initially drafted by someone else and then finalized after Mao's modifications. "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" was first published in the Yan'an publication "Communist." After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this work was included in Mao Zedong's Selected Works after his review. In this article, Mao Zedong differentiated the bourgeois democratic revolution into the old democratic revolution and the new democratic revolution, explicitly stating that "the so-called revolutionary new democracy is the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution led by the proletariat and the broad masses."
Why can China's current stage of bourgeois democratic revolution only be the revolution of New Democracy? This is determined by the actual national conditions of China. Mao Zedong wrote, "To understand the nature of Chinese society, that is, to understand China's national conditions, constitutes the fundamental basis for understanding all revolutionary problems." Precisely because of this, the book "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" starts with an analysis of Chinese society, and based on this foundation, it systematically elaborates on the objects, tasks, dynamics, nature, and prospects of the Chinese revolution.
He pointed out that Chinese society at the present time is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. This social nature determines that the main objects or main enemies of the current stage of the Chinese revolution are imperialism and feudalism. Among them, imperialist national oppression is the greatest oppression, thus imperialists are the Chinese people's first and fiercest enemies. After Japan's armed invasion of China, the main enemy of the Chinese revolution became Japanese imperialism and all collaborators and reactionaries who openly surrendered or were prepared to surrender to Japan. The tasks of the Chinese revolution are the national revolution, which aims to overthrow imperialist oppression, and the democratic revolution, which aims to overthrow feudal and landlord oppression. The most crucial task is the national revolution to overthrow imperialism. These two revolutionary tasks are interrelated.
The enemies of the Chinese revolution are exceptionally powerful. Who can complete the arduous task of the Chinese revolution? This is the question of the motive force of the Chinese revolution. After systematically analyzing the economic status and political situation of various classes in Chinese society, Mao Zedong concluded that the Chinese proletariat has many outstanding advantages, making it the fundamental driving force of the Chinese revolution. "The Chinese revolution cannot succeed without the leadership of the proletariat." However, relying solely on the strength of this class is not enough to achieve victory. To succeed, it is necessary to unite all possible revolutionary classes and strata in various circumstances and organize a united front of the revolution.Among the various classes in Chinese society, farmers are the steadfast allies of the working class, while the urban petty bourgeoisie are also reliable allies. The national bourgeoisie, on the other hand, are allies to a certain extent and within a certain period of time.
China's bourgeoisie is a complex issue. Mao Zedong clearly stated that "there is a distinction between the bourgeoisie with mercantile tendencies and the national bourgeoisie." This is an extremely important distinction. Mao pointed out that the national bourgeoisie is a class with dual characteristics. On the one hand, they are subjected to oppression from imperialism and feudalism, which makes them one of the forces of revolution. On the other hand, due to their economic and political weaknesses, and their failure to completely sever ties with imperialism and feudalism, they lack the courage to fully oppose imperialism and feudalism, which becomes more evident when the revolutionary strength of the people increases. Mao emphasized that this dual nature of the national bourgeoisie determines that they can participate in the revolution against imperialism and the bureaucratic-military government to a certain extent and within a certain period of time, becoming a revolutionary force. However, in another period of time, they can become dangerous assistants to the comprador bourgeoisie, following behind them in counterrevolutionary activities. During the resistance against Japanese aggression, they not only distinguished themselves from the surrenderist factions of the landlords and the big bourgeoisie but also from the reactionary factions of the big bourgeoisie. They continue to be our better allies. Therefore, it is completely necessary to adopt a cautious policy towards the national bourgeoisie. At the same time, it is pointed out that the bourgeois class with mercantile tendencies in China is divided among several imperialist countries. During the resistance against Japanese aggression, a distinction should be made between the pro-Japanese factions of the big bourgeoisie and the Anglo-American factions of the big bourgeoisie. The former should be overthrown, while the latter have a dual nature and require a two-faced policy of revolution. In addition, many enlightened gentlemen from small and middle landlord families who have certain capitalist tendencies, as well as the enthusiasm for resistance against Japanese aggression, need to be united with them in the fight against Japan (regarding the differences between the big bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, between the pro-Japanese factions of the big bourgeoisie and the non-pro-Japanese factions, namely the Anglo-American factions of the big bourgeoisie, between the landlords and the small and middle landlords and enlightened gentlemen, these differences were not mentioned when "Revolution and the Communist Party of China" was initially published in "The Communist "). On March 11, 1940, Mao Zedong first mentioned this issue in "Strategic Issues within the United Front Against Japan". After April of that year, he made corresponding revisions to this part of "Revolution and the Communist Party of China", which can be seen in the article published in November of that year, edited and published by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the "Collected Essays on Party Building".
The colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society, which is China's unique national condition, determines that "the nature of the current stage of the Chinese revolution is not proletarian socialist, but bourgeois democratic". However, "the bourgeois democratic revolution in China at this stage is no longer the old-style general bourgeois democratic revolution, which is outdated, but a new kind of special bourgeois democratic revolution. This revolution is unfolding in China and all other colonial and semi-colonial countries. We call this revolution the new democratic revolution." This new democratic revolution is "a revolution against imperialism and feudalism led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people." "Chinese society must go through this revolution in order to further develop into a socialist society, otherwise it is impossible." This is the most important conclusion drawn by Mao Zedong in this article.
Mao Zedong also pointed out that the new democratic revolution will inevitably bring about two results: on the one hand, it will remove obstacles to the development of capitalism and allow capitalism to develop to a certain extent. On the other hand, there will be the development of socialist elements, which include the increase in the proportion of the proletariat and the Communist Party in the national political power, the recognition of the proletarian and Communist Party's leadership by the peasants, intellectuals, and urban petty bourgeoisie, and the state-owned economy and cooperative economy of the democratic republic.With a favorable international environment, the future of the Chinese revolution can be directed towards socialism rather than capitalism.
The publication of Mao Zedong's work "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" greatly broadened people's horizons. It provides such a systematic and clear explanation of the nature of Chinese society and the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution that the previously dazzling and chaotic social phenomena suddenly appeared well-organized and easy to understand, allowing people to have a clear understanding and consistently grasp the basic direction in the face of complex and changing situations. The tremendous impact it had at that time and for a long time afterwards is immeasurable.
The banner of "New Democracy" has been raised high. Therefore, the specific content of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of New Democracy, as well as their characteristics, and many other questions need further elaboration and clarification. In January 1940, the First Representative Conference of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region Cultural Association was held in Yan'an. Mao Zedong delivered a long speech at the conference, entitled "The Politics of New Democracy and the Culture of New Democracy." "This long speech lasted from the afternoon until the time the gas lamps were lit in the evening." "The crowded audience of five to six hundred in the meeting hall was inspired and attracted by his profound insights and vivid language, concentrating attentively, holding their breath to listen, with passionate emotions erupting into applause from time to time." A month later, this speech was first published in the inaugural issue of "Chinese Culture", and a few days later, it was published in the combined 98th and 99th issues of "Liberation" with the title changed to "On New Democracy". Mao Zedong himself said that the "main purpose of this speech was to refute the stubborn faction," but its significance far exceeded this scope.
In his speech, Mao Zedong clearly posed the question "Where is China headed?" and he answered it very explicitly: "We want to establish a new China." He said, "We Communists have been struggling not only for China's political revolution and economic revolution, but also for China's cultural revolution; the purpose of all this is to build a new society and a new nation for the Chinese people."
In this speech, Mao Zedong systematically expounded on the theory and program of New Democracy and once again discussed the issue of the Sinification of Marxism. He said, "Formally absorbing foreign things has been a great loss for the past in China. Chinese Communists must also do the same with the application of Marxism in China. They must fully and appropriately unite the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution, that is to say, combine it with the national characteristics through certain national forms in order to be useful. It cannot be subjectively and formulaically applied."
In this way, Mao Zedong outlined the basic characteristics and specific content of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the New Democratic state, and depicted a clear and complete outline of what kind of country the Communist Party of China aimed to establish in the New China.
In this article, Mao Zedong refuted a claim spread by the stubborn faction: since you Communists have already pushed the socialist system to a later stage and also proclaimed that the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and that our party is willing to fight for their complete realization, then you should temporarily set aside communism.Mao Zedong wrote: "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a new social system." "The democratic revolution in China cannot succeed without the guidance of communism, let alone the subsequent stage of revolution." He also specifically analyzed the similarities and differences between the Three Principles of the People and communism.
"On New Democracy" is an article with a rigorous theoretical system, and it is also an article with strong polemical characteristics. Mao Zedong spent a long time brewing this article and made repeated revisions during the writing process, seeking opinions from comrades. More than twenty years later, he mentioned: "When I was halfway through writing 'On New Democracy,' the idea of dividing the past eighty years and the last twenty years as two stages in China's nearly hundred-year history gradually became clearer. Therefore, I started rewriting it and went through repeated modifications before finalizing the draft." Even Ye Qing, a reactionary writer who had always attacked the Communist Party for not having its own theory, had to admit that since reading "On New Democracy," "I have regarded Mao Zedong as a theoretician of the Communist Party." The article has caused significant reactions both inside and outside the party, allowing many people to have a clear understanding of the current goals of the struggle and the future direction of China, attracting more and more people to rally under the banner of New Democracy.
The fundamental difference between the New Democratic Revolution and the old democratic revolution lies in whether the proletariat has seized leadership. The issue of the proletariat's leadership has long been raised within the Communist Party of China. However, in such a complex environment in China, how can the proletariat achieve leadership? Mao Zedong also underwent long-term thinking and exploration on this issue and made a comprehensive exposition in the article "The Inaugural Issue of 'The Communist'". He pointed out: "Through eighteen years of experience, we have learned that the united front, armed struggle, and party building are the Communist Party of China's three primary magic weapons for defeating the enemy in the Chinese revolution." Regarding the relationship between these three, Mao Zedong wrote: "The united front and armed struggle are the two fundamental weapons for defeating the enemy. The united front is the united front in carrying out armed struggle. Party organization, on the other hand, is the courageous fighter wielding the united front and armed struggle as weapons in launching attacks against the enemy." "Correctly understanding these three issues and their interrelationships is equivalent to correctly leading the entire Chinese revolution." And now, "We are already capable of correctly handling the issue of the united front, correctly handling the issue of armed struggle, and correctly handling the issue of party building." This is an important summary he made of the Communist Party's struggle over the past eighteen years.
Why was Mao Zedong able to make such a huge theoretical creation? On the one hand, it is because he has always grounded himself in the infinitely rich practice of the Chinese revolution. Each deepening of his understanding comes from careful observation and deep thinking about various new situations and problems in objective, real-life, and from exchanging opinions with people who understand the actual situation, seeking collective wisdom, never engaging in detached personal speculation. On the other hand, it is because he diligently and assiduously studied Marxist works. His method was to apply Marxist theory, and to apply it, one must read it regularly. Focus on reading Marxist classics, and through them, one can understand the development of Marxism and deepen one's understanding of the universal truths of Marxism through debates and criticisms of various theoretical viewpoints. He once told Zeng Zhizhi: "When I was writing 'On New Democracy,' I had consulted the Communist Manifesto many times."
Mao Zedong has always believed that it is crucial to indicate the direction and future of the revolution, but having these alone is not enough. It is also necessary to determine the policies and strategies for achieving these goals. He said, "Only by clearly explaining the theory and practical policies can the problem be considered complete." Of course, at that time, what attracted Mao Zedong's attention more was the practical policy issues within the Anti-Japanese National United Front, rather than the specific policies of the later New China. However, there are many similarities between the two.
By the end of 1940, on the eve of the event in Southern Anhui (Wannan Incident), the situation was extremely severe and Mao Zedong was extremely busy with work. However, he did not relax at all in comprehensively summarizing the Party's historical experience, especially the new experience in the strategy of united front. On February 4th and 13th, the Central Political Bureau held a serious discussion on these issues. Mao Zedong pointed out at the meeting that the past experience and lessons should be summarized, roughly divided into three periods: the period of the Great Revolution, the Soviet period, and the period of the Anti-Japanese War. The major mistake was not understanding the long-term and uneven characteristics of the Chinese Revolution. Many "left" mistakes were made in the late Soviet period because Marxism-Leninism was not linked to reality. He proposed to organize a committee to summarize various policy issues of the Party, and some of them should also be formulated into regulations. On February 25th, based on the comprehensive experience in summarizing these aspects carried out by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong drafted an internal instruction on the current situation and policies (the policy part of the instruction is included in Mao Zedong's Selected Works as "On Policy"). The instruction clearly pointed out: "Under the current anticommunist high tide situation, our policies are of decisive significance." "During the entire period of the Anti-Japanese War, our party's policy of the Anti-Japanese National United Front will never change; many policies during the period of the land revolution in the past decade should not be simply quoted anymore." The instruction criticized some "left" opportunistic mistakes that occurred during the period of land revolution and pointed out: "The current policy of the Anti-Japanese National United Front is not to deny all alliances and struggles, nor to deny all struggles within alliances, but to combine alliances with struggles."
The instruction emphasized the clarification and specification of a series of policies for the Anti-Japanese National United Front, including: the policy of independent autonomy under the united front, which requires both unity and independence; guerrilla warfare with independent autonomy under unified military strategy, which is primarily guerrilla warfare but does not give up mobile warfare under favorable conditions; in the struggle against the stubborn anti-Communist faction, "utilize contradictions, win the majority, oppose the minority, and defeat each separately," and adhere to the principle of "just, advantageous, and controlled"; adopt the policy of "concealed and elite, long-term concealment, accumulation of strength, and wait for the opportunity" in the enemy-occupied areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas; develop progressive forces in domestic relations, seek the support of moderate forces, and isolate stubborn forces; and so on.
Starting from specific class analysis, the instruction particularly emphasizes the need to make various distinctions, such as distinguishing between the anti-Japanese pro-Japanese feudalist and bourgeois class and the pro-Japanese pro-British/American feudalist and bourgeois class; and distinguishing between the feudal and bourgeois class who support the resistance against Japan but waver and those who support unity but are anti-Communist, as well as the less ambiguous national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie and enlightened gentry. Internationally, distinctions should also be made between different imperialist countries, and so on. It specifically points out, "Establish our policies based on these distinctions. The aforementioned different policies all stem from the distinctions of these class relations."
Regarding specific policies, the instruction also explicitly specifies concrete policies on power organization, labor, land, taxation, counter-sabotage, people's rights, economy, culture education, military, and other aspects based on the strategic principles of the united front.
The last instruction states: "The strategic principles and many specific policies in the United Front must be resolutely implemented by the entire party. When the Japanese invaders intensify their aggression against China and the domestic big landlords and bourgeoisie carry out anti-Communist and anti-people's high-pressure policies and military attacks, only by implementing the above-mentioned strategic principles and specific policies, can we persist in resisting Japan, develop the united front, gain the sympathy of the people nationwide, and strive for an improvement in the situation."
The emergence of the theory of New Democratic Revolution and the establishment of a series of guidelines and policies for the Anti-Japanese National United Front marked the maturity of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. After eighteen years of trials and tribulations, Mao Zedong finally pointed out the correct path for the Chinese people to achieve victory in the democratic revolution and build a new China, which is suitable for the national conditions of China.
Mao Zedong said in his early years: "Ideology is like a flag. Only when the flag is raised can we have hope and know where to go." This flag should be colorful, simple and clear, and have a very rich and definite connotation, so that it can be easily understood and accepted by more people. Since the Chinese people accepted Marxism around the time of the May Fourth Movement, after twenty years of arduous exploration and twists and turns, they have successfully combined Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. During the period of the Anti-Japanese War, they independently raised the banner of "New Democracy", making more and more people have hope and know where to go. This is a great event in Chinese history. It not only had a major impact during the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, but also played a huge guiding role in future Chinese revolution and construction.
Section 2 Further Development of the Theory of New Democracy
I. The establishment of the position of the theory of New Democracy and the development of policy ideas
Around the theory of the New Democratic Revolution, the Communist Party of China has enriched its thinking in various aspects such as the theory of the revolutionary path, the construction of the people's army, the strategy and tactics of people's war, the strategy of united front, economic thought, and cultural work, gradually making the thinking more complete. This shows that through the test from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the land war, from the failure of the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign to the rise of the Anti-Japanese War, the Party accumulated rich revolutionary experience, especially during the period of the Anti-Japanese War, the Party correctly responded to new problems arising in the national struggle and class struggle in the face of complex international situations and domestic environments, have accumulated a lot of new experience, and further recognized the laws of the Chinese revolution, as Mao Zedong said: "It was only during the Anti-Japanese War that we formulated a party's general line and a set of specific policies that suited the situation. It was at this time that we recognized the inevitable kingdom of the Chinese democratic revolution and we gained freedom." It can be seen that during the period of the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zedong transcended to a new stage in the integration of Marxist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution, forming a theoretical system of New Democratic Revolution, which has been comprehensively developed in politics, economy, military, culture, party construction, and other aspects, and has taken shape. The new democratic thought and theory, after being tested in practice, have the following significance:
Firstly, systematically summarizing the historical experience of work in the white areas and the construction of revolutionary base areas in rural areas, and correctly formulating the party's struggle strategies in the Japanese-occupied areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, as well as the guidelines and policies for the economic, political, and cultural development in the liberated areas.
The struggle of surrounding the cities from the countryside, with the rural revolutionary base areas as the main base and armed struggle as the main form of struggle. "But emphasizing armed struggle does not mean that other forms of struggle can be abandoned; on the contrary, without the coordination of various forms of struggle other than armed struggle, armed struggle cannot achieve victory. Emphasizing work in rural base areas does not mean that urban work and work in other vast rural areas under enemy rule can be abandoned; on the contrary, without urban work and other rural work, rural base areas will be isolated, and the revolution will fail.To this end, the Party Central Committee led by Mao Zedong systematically summarized the experience and lessons of the party's work in the white areas since its establishment. Based on the semi-colonial and semi-feudal characteristics of Chinese society, they creatively formulated a complete set of struggle strategies suitable for the Japanese-occupied areas and the Nationalist Party-controlled areas. They also systematically summarized the experience and lessons of rural revolutionary base construction since 1927 to the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance against Japan, and formulated policies and guidelines suitable for the economic, political, and cultural development of the liberated areas during the war. The implementation of these strategies and policies, combined with the massive and spectacular guerrilla warfare launched by hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, truly turned the war of resistance against Japan into a nationwide revolution.
Secondly, the Party systematically summarized the experience and lessons of Party building issues, and creatively launched the rectification movement to unite the party's understanding on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
On the eve of the war of resistance against Japan and during the war, the Party Central Committee led by Mao Zedong systematically summarized the experience and lessons of Party building issues, further strengthening the party's construction ideologically. They proposed summarizing the experience and lessons of the Chinese revolution based on the basic principles of dialectical materialism theory and strengthening party building through straightening out the party's ideological line. They strengthened party building through the unique political line of united front and armed struggle, and creatively launched the rectification movement to oppose subjectivism, sectarianism, and party formalism, so as to unite the party's understanding on the basis of the universally applicable principles of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution.
Thirdly, Mao Zedong Thought was officially recognized as the guiding ideology of the whole party. The Seventh National Congress of the Party was the most important representative congress of the Communist Party of China during the democratic revolution period after the establishment of the party. That congress summarized the historical experience of China's democratic revolution for more than 20 years, formulated correct principles and strategies, overcame erroneous thinking within the party, and achieved unprecedented unity of the whole party based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. That congress laid the foundation for the victory of the new democratic revolution nationwide. The newly adopted Party Constitution solemnly stipulated that the Communist Party of China, guided by the unity of Marxism-Leninism theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution - Mao Zedong Thought, serves as the guiding ideology for all its work. This means that at that time, Mao Zedong Thought had developed and matured into the recognized guiding ideology of the whole party, and the whole party had achieved unprecedented unity and cohesion based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. From the Zunyi Conference to the period of the war of resistance against Japan, the party's understanding gradually unified and finally completely unified based on Mao Zedong Thought, which reflects the objective laws of the Chinese democratic revolution. It is precisely because the whole party operated based on Mao Zedong Thought, which reflects the objective laws of the Chinese democratic revolution, that the party's ranks were united and cohesive, enabling them to lead hundreds of millions of people to persist in the war of resistance for eight years under extremely disparate enemy strength. This led to unprecedented development of the revolutionary strength of the Communist Party of China and the people, as well as cooperation with the Soviet Union and other countries in the anti-fascist war, ultimately defeating the Japanese invaders. If all the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people in the past century have experienced successive failures or setbacks, the war of resistance against Japan is different. The Chinese people finally achieved ultimate victory. This was related to the presence of much more favorable conditions internationally and domestically, but more importantly, it was because the whole party, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly utilized these favorable conditions and overcame the unfavorable conditions. Mao Zedong Thought guided the great victory of the war of resistance against Japan and laid a solid foundation for the ultimate victory of the new democratic revolution throughout China.
II. The victory of the new democratic revolution and the expansion of the theory of new democracy.
During the period of the War of Liberation and after the establishment of New China, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the whole country fought a great and intense war of liberation, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and established the new China with the people's democratic dictatorship. They successfully accomplished the transformation of Chinese society from new democracy to socialism, and achieved great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction, thus enabling Mao Zedong Thought to make new developments in many aspects. "Use the revolutionary hands to overcome the counter-revolutionary hands."
Facing the complex situation after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party of China (CPC) not only anticipated the possibility of carrying out China's social and political reforms through peaceful means under the influence of various international and domestic factors but also fully anticipated the emergence of another situation, namely, after the CPC took steps to negotiate peace, the Chiang Kai-shek group, driven by its class nature, would still launch a counter-revolutionary civil war. Therefore, the CPC clearly proposed the strategy of using the revolutionary hands to overcome the counter-revolutionary hands. This allows the CPC, when the first situation occurs under certain conditions, to seize the opportunity to carry out peaceful and lawful struggles in order to win the support of the broad masses and the sympathy of the middle class. And when the second situation arrives, the CPC is fully prepared to counteract the military aggression of the Kuomintang and has sufficient reason to expose the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's government in sabotaging peace and launching a counter-revolutionary civil war, thereby explaining the necessity of the CPC to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek government and establish a new China through revolutionary war. This strategy of using revolutionary hands not only enables our party to maintain a clear mind and a strong fighting spirit, without being bound by the desire for peace and relaxing its preparation for a defensive war, but also makes our party's struggle more flexible, always in a politically dominant position, and able to win over as many middle masses as possible while thoroughly isolating the small handful of reactionary forces led by Chiang Kai-shek and depriving them of excuses to initiate a civil war. The transition from strategic defense to strategic offense, the formulation and development of the Ten Great Principles of Military Affairs, under the circumstances of a huge disparity in the balance of forces between us and the enemy, can the Chinese People's Liberation Army defeat the offensive of the Chiang army? How can it be defeated? Mao Zedong, as the leader of the Party Central Committee, has clearly resolved these significant issues concerning the success or failure of the Chinese Revolution. Mao Zedong explicitly stated, "We must not only defeat Chiang Kai-shek, but also be able to defeat him." Thus, the Party Central Committee correctly formulated and implemented the strategic defensive plan to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and determined to switch to strategic offense at the appropriate time after the smooth development of the strategic defense.
At the end of December 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at a meeting of the CPC Central Committee: the main force of the People's Liberation Army has entered the territory under the rule of the Kuomintang. This is a turning point in history. This is a turning point from the development to the elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's 20 years of reactionary rule. This is a turning point from the development to the elimination of more than 100 years of imperialist rule in China. In order to completely eliminate the reactionary army of Chiang Kai-shek and finally achieve national victory, Mao Zedong systematically put forward the Ten Great Principles of Military Affairs for the People's Liberation Army. These military principles were systematically proposed in the process of the People's Liberation War transitioning from the strategic defense stage to the strategic offense stage. They not only summarized and summarized the combat experience of the People's Liberation Army over a long period of time but also included scientific predictions about the war process and its development trend. By applying these military principles, the People's Liberation Army not only crushed the Kuomintang's crazy attacks on the liberated areas but also successfully transitioned from strategic defense to strategic offense until the implementation of a strategic decisive battle.During the period of the nationwide liberation war, the extensive land reform movement was launched and the people's democratic united front was consolidated and expanded. Led by Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee initiated a massive land reform movement, which further strengthened the alliance between the working class and the peasantry. Based on the working class-led alliance, all the people who could be united and mobilized were united, including not only the national bourgeoisie, but also patriotic individuals who split from the ruling clique of the Kuomintang, and enlightened gentlemen who separated from the feudal landlord class. This enabled the people's democratic united front to achieve unprecedented consolidation and growth, completely isolating and leaving Chiang Kai-shek's group in a desperate situation. In May 1948, the Communist Party of China put forward the call for convening a political consultation conference free of reactionary elements and discussing the establishment of a democratic coalition government. This call immediately received enthusiastic responses from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic individuals. They sent representatives to enter the liberated areas and work together with the Communist Party of China to prepare for the new political consultation. In the climax of the people's liberation army's strategic decisive battles, the democratic parties declared their agreement with the Communist Party of China's policies on industry and commerce and land reform; they recognized that the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was the root cause of counter-revolutionary civil war and the fundamental obstacle to domestic peace and democracy; they pointed out that American imperialism was the enemy of the Chinese people. They issued a joint statement, openly announcing the abandonment of the middle road and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This was a major victory for the Communist Party of China in correctly handling its relationship with the bourgeoisie. 
In September 1949, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference officially opened. The Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the various armies, regions, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic individuals all sent representatives to attend the conference. They represented the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and all other patriotic individuals, effectively representing the whole nation. Therefore, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was officially established as the specific organizational form of the people's democratic united front. The Communist Party of China formulated a common program through this conference, uniting all democratic classes and ethnic groups in the country to complete the great historical task of finally overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and establishing the People's Republic of China. Thus, the people's democratic united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism "developed into a state led by the working class and based on the alliance between the working class and the peasantry." During the entire period of the liberation war, the Party Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, always regarded the issue of Party building as a central link related to the success or failure of the revolution, and adopted effective measures: on the one hand, launching rectification movements to reorganize grassroots Party organizations in the rural areas; on the other hand, strengthening the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, ensuring high unity among the party, government, and military leadership in implementing policies and discipline, while also paying attention to improving the Party committee system, promoting the democratic traditions within the Party, and carrying out democratic movements within the Party and the military. In this way, the work of the Party's grassroots organizations and the leadership organs at all levels have been strengthened and improved, further consolidating and developing the ideological, political, organizational unity and solidarity achieved by the whole Party at the Seventh National Congress, and effectively ensuring the victory of the nationwide revolution from the perspective of Party leadership. Regarding the struggle strategy in the Kuomintang-ruled areas and the policies for taking over and administrating cities, during the nationwide liberation war, the mass struggles led by the Communist Party of China in the Kuomintang-ruled areas achieved unprecedented development, forming an important front in the rear of Chiang Kai-shek's group. The opening and development of the second front effectively coordinated with the Communist Party and the people's liberation army in smashing the Kuomintang's attacks on the liberated areas. As the strategic offensives, decisive battles, and strategic pursuits of the People's Liberation Army unfolded successively, they effectively cooperated with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army in protecting and taking over the central cities that had long been occupied by the enemy.
This is the continued development of the theory of new democratic revolution in regards to the policy direction and struggle strategy in the white areas. Regarding the theory and policy on people's democratic dictatorship and the transition from new democracy to socialism, the people's democratic dictatorship is the link between the Chinese Communist Party's lowest program and its highest program, and it is the political condition for the transition from new democracy to socialism. It is both a political power with the nature of new democracy and a political power that can smoothly transition into a dictatorship of the proletariat. This transition can and should be completed peacefully, without the need for a violent revolution to overthrow the reactionary regime, as was the case in Russia from the February Revolution to the October Revolution. This is because the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang has been destroyed by the revolutionary war. The people's democratic dictatorship established in China, whether during the period of new democratic revolution or during the period of socialist revolution, is a people's political power based on the alliance of the working class and the peasantry led by the Communist Party. During the transition to socialist revolution, the masses of workers and peasants will of course not rise up to overthrow their own political power. This is a new development by Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on the armed seizure of political power. Mao Zedong specifically emphasized: Summing up our experience, focusing on one point, it is the people's democratic dictatorship based on the alliance of the working class and the peasantry (led by the Communist Party). This dictatorship must be in unity with the international revolutionary forces. This is our formula, this is our major experience, this is our major program. We can fully rely on this weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship to unite all the people in the country except for the reactionaries and steadily reach our goals.
Basic Laws of the New Democratic Revolution
Section 1: The Party's Understanding of the National Situation in Modern China
I. The Concept of "Semi-Colonial, Semi-Feudal"
In modern China, the country is in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, which determines that the revolution must be carried out in two steps, engaging in armed struggle and following the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside. Mao Zedong said: "Only by understanding the nature of Chinese society can we understand the object of the Chinese revolution, the tasks of the Chinese revolution, the forces of the Chinese revolution, the nature of the Chinese revolution, and the prospects and transformations of the Chinese revolution." Therefore, "understanding the nature of Chinese society means understanding the national situation of China, which is the fundamental basis for understanding all revolutionary questions." The main task of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 was to establish the Chinese Communist Party and determine its nature. At this time, Chinese communists did not have a profound understanding of the unique nature of China's national situation and revolution, but they concluded that the Chinese revolution would inevitably be a socialist revolution led by the proletariat based on the overall international situation after the victory of the October Revolution. After the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, through studying and mastering Marxism and through revolutionary practice, they began to have a further understanding of the international and domestic situations and the social conditions in China. In early 1922, Chinese Communists participated in the first congress of Communist and National Revolutionary organizations in the Far East, organized by the Communist International, and they accepted Lenin's theories on the national colonial question. On June 15, 1922, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Position of the Chinese Communist Party on the Current Situation." This document focused on analyzing the history and current situation of the oppression of the Chinese people by international imperialism and Chinese feudal warlords colluding with each other, and it pointed out that China was a "semi-independent feudal country" under the rule of international imperialism, domestic feudal warlords, and bureaucratic ruling class. The manifesto of the Second National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party further analyzed the nature of Chinese society and clearly put forward the democratic revolutionary program of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. After the Second National Congress, Chinese communists continued to discuss the nature of Chinese society.
In 1923, Chen Duxiu used the concept of "semi-colonial" in his article "The Chinese National Revolution and Social Classes". He believed that the revolution of semi-colonial countries had dual significance: national revolution against foreign powers and democratic revolution internally. It aimed to achieve economic independence and political freedom. This unique nature of the national revolution in semi-colonial countries was emphasized in the declaration of the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which referred to China's democratic revolution as the "national revolution", distinguishing it from the bourgeois democratic revolutions in European countries. That summer, Mao Zedong also used the term "semi-colonial" in his political essay "The Beijing Coup and the Businessmen". He pointed out that in semi-colonial China, the political oppression included both the collusion of local warlords and foreign imperialists to suppress the national people. The historical mission of the Chinese national revolution was to overthrow the warlords and foreign imperialists with the strength of the people. In 1926, Cai Hesen used the term "semi-colonial and semi-feudal China" in "The Development of the History of the Chinese Communist Party". Based on a correct understanding of the nature of modern Chinese society and revolution, young members of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen and his Kuomintang, established a united front for revolution and launched a vigorous national revolution. However, at this time, the Chinese Communist Party did not have a fully conscious understanding of Chinese society and the development laws of the revolution. In the summer of 1927, the national revolution finally failed. Chiang Kai-shek, representing the new right-wing of the Kuomintang, established a new regime in Nanjing.
What kind of regime was the Kuomintang regime represented by Chiang Kai-shek? What kind of society was China under the rule of this regime? Did the nature of China as a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country undergo fundamental changes? These were the questions that the Chinese Communists had to address in the first place for the revival of the revolution. At the time, different people had different understandings of this issue. Some said that Chinese society was still feudal, some said that China had already become a capitalist society, and others said it was a pre-capitalist society. Of course, some insisted that China was still a semi-colonial society, and so on. The 6th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held in June and July 1928, analyzed the political and economic conditions of Chinese society after the failure of the national revolution, pointing out that on one hand, true unity in China had not yet been achieved, and China had not been liberated from the iron grip of imperialism, thus the Chinese revolution was still a semi-colonial revolution; on the other hand, the landlord class and the private land ownership system had not been overthrown, and all the remnants of semi-feudalism had not been eliminated. Therefore, the nature of the Chinese revolution at the present stage was still a bourgeois democratic revolution. 
In February 1929, the Chinese Communist Party officially put forward the complete concept of "semi-colonial and semi-feudal" in its own documents. However, shortly after the 6th Congress, there was a debate within the party regarding this issue, which had already been considered resolved. Chen Duxiu and others accepted Trotsky's incorrect view on the Chinese question, believing that the failure of the national revolution indicated the victory of the bourgeoisie and the final blow to the remnants of feudalism. They considered the Nanjing government of the Kuomintang to be a regime centered and led by the bourgeoisie, and believed that Chinese society was already predominantly capitalist and would undergo peaceful development. They argued that the proletariat should wait until capitalism was highly developed before undertaking a socialist revolution, and in the current stage, they could only engage in a legal movement centered around the "national assembly" slogan. This effectively denied the fact that Chinese society was still semi-colonial and semi-feudal, and denied the necessity of continuing the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism. It was a mistaken right-wing view that amounted to the negation of the revolution.
At the same time, some people within the Communist Party of China, who held leadership positions in the CCP, were influenced by Stalin and the Communist International. They believed that the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, had betrayed the revolution and that the entire bourgeoisie in China had defected. They argued that the Kuomintang regime was a capitalist regime. They advocated for the Chinese revolution to not only oppose imperialism and feudalism but also to oppose the bourgeoisie and upper petty bourgeoisie as a whole. They blurred the distinction between opposition to capitalism and opposition to imperialism and feudalism, leading to the adventurist "left" view. Both the right-wing and "left" views exaggerated the capitalist elements of Chinese society under Kuomintang rule and made mistakes regarding the fundamental question of the nature of Chinese society. It is worth noting that although they had nearly identical misconceptions about the nature of Chinese society, they arrived at two completely different conclusions regarding the nature of the revolution: one calling for the annulment of the national and democratic revolution, and the other calling for going beyond the national and democratic revolution. This demonstrates that correctly understanding the nature of Chinese society is extremely important for revolutionary political parties.
II. The deepening comprehension of the Chinese national conditions and the great debate on the nature of Chinese society.
While the Communist Party of China was conducting new explorations regarding Chinese society and the nature of the revolution, some intellectuals within the Kuomintang also frequently published articles discussing the nature of Chinese society. Tao Xisheng was one of the representatives in this regard. From 1928 to 1929, he wrote numerous articles, sometimes claiming that modern Chinese society was a feudal society under imperialist rule, sometimes arguing that China was no longer a feudal country but a society in which the literary and official classes and the power relations of peasants were the main social structures after the collapse of feudalism and before the development of capitalism, and sometimes asserting that Chinese society, from the perspective of feudalism, was in a late feudal period and, from the perspective of capitalism, was in a pre-capitalist society. The contradictory and ambiguous statements he made on the nature of Chinese society were aimed at confusing the issue and opposing the independent leadership of the Communist Party and the thriving land revolution.
It was in this context that a debate on the nature of Chinese society erupted. This debate began in the late 1920s and lasted until the mid-1930s, spanning a decade. The focus of the debate expanded from the nature of Chinese society to Chinese social history and delved deep into the nature of rural Chinese society. Under the direct leadership or influence of the Communist Party of China, Marxist theoretical workers and progressive social scientists actively engaged in this major debate. They analyzed modern Chinese society and the Chinese revolution from the standpoint, viewpoint, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, refuting various erroneous views, particularly those put forward by Tao Xisheng and the Trotskyists. They provided a preliminary demonstration of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society. They emphasized that in order to understand the nature of the Chinese revolution, it was necessary to first clarify the economic structure and its particular characteristics of Chinese society. The various absurd views on the nature of Chinese society proposed by Tao Xisheng and the Trotskyists were all obstacles to the Chinese revolution. They pointed out that China was a semi-colonial country oppressed by international imperialism. Imperialist aggression dealt a serious blow to China's feudal natural economy, causing the Chinese economy to begin developing towards capitalism. On the other hand, imperialism colluded with the feudal forces in China and used all its strength to hinder the development of China's national capital and the collapse of national industry, which was a widespread phenomenon at the time. In China, semi-feudal relations still enjoyed a comparative advantage. Their arguments were preliminary but, given the diverse opinions on the nature of Chinese society at the time, they outlined the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society, and this scientific proposition by the Communist Party of China was disseminated among the masses through the debate, which carried significant meaning. The highest achievement of the Party's understanding in this regard was the work "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," co-authored by Mao Zedong, Zhang Wentian, and Li Weihan in December 1939.
"China's Revolution and the Communist Party of China" analyzes that after the feudal society that had been continuing for about three thousand years since the Zhou and Qin dynasties, it pointed out: "Since the Opium War of 1840, China has gradually become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Since the September 18th Incident of 1931 when Japanese imperialism armed invaded China, China has become a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society." Mao Zedong further elaborated on this in his article "On New Democracy" written in January 1940: "Since foreign capitalist aggression against China and the gradual growth of capitalist elements in Chinese society, China has gradually become a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society. Present-day China, in the Japanese-occupied areas, is a colonial society; in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, it is basically still a semi-colonial society; and regardless of whether it is in the Japanese-occupied areas or the Kuomintang-ruled areas, it is a society where feudal and semi-feudal systems dominate. This is the nature of present-day Chinese society, this is the national situation of present-day China."
The transformation of modern Chinese society from a completely feudal society to a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society was not accidental, and this social transformation went through a long, slow, and complex process. Recognizing this is not only helpful for a profound understanding of the nature of modern Chinese society, but also for the correct evaluation and understanding of the role that foreign capitalism has played in China over the past hundred years.
The book "China's Revolution and the Communist Party of China" analyzes the evolution of modern Chinese society from two perspectives: first, the process of China evolving from a completely feudal society to a semi-feudal society; second, the process of China evolving from an independent sovereign state to a semi-colonial and colonial state. These are two historical processes that occurred in the same time and space. The book believes that the main cause of these changes was the intrusion of foreign capitalism. "Imperialist powers invading China not only led to the disintegration of Chinese feudal society and the emergence of capitalist elements, transforming it from a feudal society into a semi-feudal society, but on the other hand, they cruelly ruled China, transforming an independent China into a semi-colonial and colonial China."
So, what role did foreign capitalism play in the transformation of China from a completely feudal society to a semi-feudal society? The book believes, "Foreign capitalism had a significant disintegrating effect on China's socio-economic structure. On one hand, it destroyed the foundation of China's self-sufficient natural economy and the handicraft industries in cities and rural areas; on the other hand, it promoted the development of China's urban and rural commodity economies." Whether it was the destruction of the natural economic foundation or the development of China's urban and rural commodity economies, it created conditions for the emergence and development of the Chinese bourgeoisie. However, due to imperialism controlling China's economic lifeline and political power since the mid-20th century, Chinese national capital that emerged during that period faced extremely difficult conditions and could not develop and grow normally. It never became the dominant form of China's socio-economic structure and did not lead China into a capitalist society.
Chinese national capital not only faced exclusion from foreign capital with various privileges but also had no power to resist the pre-capitalist exploitative systems that still held a dominant position in Chinese society. As a result, modern China changed its intended historical direction and gradually evolved into a "semi-feudal society with a weak capitalist economy and a severe semi-feudal economy, where modern-style industrial and commercial cities coexist with stagnant rural areas."
However, the aforementioned changes are only one aspect of the transformation of modern Chinese society. The book further points out: "The purpose of the imperialist powers' invasion of China is by no means to transform feudal China into capitalist China. On the contrary, the goals of the imperialist powers are to turn China into their semi-colonial and colonial territories.If we say that the development of capitalism in China and the transformation of China into a semi-feudal society were not the intentions or conscious acts of imperialist powers, then the fact that they turned China into their colony, subjecting it to arbitrary insults and exploitation, was determined by the nature of imperialism. Marx and Engels pointed out in The Communist Manifesto: "The need for constant expansion of markets drives the bourgeoisie to roam around the world. It must settle everywhere, start businesses everywhere, and establish connections everywhere." It destroys "all walls of the Great Wall" with its cheap goods. Just as it made the countryside subordinate to the city, it made uncivilized and semi-civilized countries subordinate to civilized countries, made the nationalities of peasants subordinate to the nationalities of the bourgeoisie, and made the East subordinate to the West. In order to conquer vast and resilient China, imperialist powers have used all their tricks and taken various methods and approaches over the past century. The book "Chinese Revolution and Chinese Communist Party" combines the history of Sino-foreign relations over the past century and summarizes ten methods and approaches used by imperialists to invade and oppress China from various aspects such as military, political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic. It vividly depicts the bloody picture of imperialism turning feudal China into a semi-feudal, semi-colonial, and colonial China.
From this, it can be understood that the invasion of China by imperialist powers, on the one hand, led to the disintegration of feudal society in China and the emergence of capitalist elements, turning a feudal society into a semi-feudal society. But on the other hand, they cruelly ruled over China, turning an independent China into a semi-colonial and colonial one. Taking these two aspects into consideration, our colonial, semi-colonial, semi-feudal society has the following characteristics:
First, the self-sufficient natural economy of the feudal era has been destroyed, but the foundation of the feudal exploitation system - the exploitation of peasants by the landlord class - not only remains but also combines with the exploitation of comprador capital and usurious capital, occupying a clear advantage in China's socio-economic life.
Second, nationalist capitalism has achieved certain development and played a significant role in China's political and cultural life. However, it has not become the dominant form of China's social economy. Its strength is weak, and most of it is more or less connected to both foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism.
Third, the autocratic rule of the emperor and nobility has been overthrown, replaced first by the rule of warlords and bureaucrats from the landlord class, and then by the dictatorship of the alliance between the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. In the occupied areas, it is the rule of Japanese imperialism and its puppets.
Fourth, imperialism not only controls China's finances and economic lifelines but also manipulates China's political and military power. In the occupied areas, everything is monopolized by Japanese imperialism.
Fifth, due to being under the rule or semi-rule of many imperialist countries, due to the long-term state of disunity in China, and due to the vast land of China, the development of China's economy, politics, and culture exhibits extreme imbalance.
Sixth, due to the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, especially the large-scale aggression by Japanese imperialism, the vast majority of the Chinese people, especially the peasants, are increasingly impoverished and even bankrupt, living in extreme poverty and deprivation of political rights. The degree of poverty and lack of freedom among the Chinese people is rare in the world.
These are the characteristics of Chinese society, which is colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal. The main factors determining this situation are the influences of Japanese imperialism and other imperialist powers, resulting from the combination of foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism.
Mao Zedong emphasized repeatedly that only by recognizing the nature of Chinese society can we understand the nature and tasks of the Chinese revolution, distinguish its targets and driving forces, and foresee its future and transformation. In short, only by understanding the social nature of China can we scientifically grasp the basic laws of modern Chinese social development and correctly solve a series of fundamental problems in the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong further elaborated on the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of modern Chinese society in works such as "On New Democracy."
Section 2: The Law of Two Stages in the Chinese Revolution
I. Initial Understanding and Insufficiency of the Law of the Chinese Revolution
The so-called law of two stages of the revolution divides the Chinese revolution into two steps: the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. "The first step is to change this colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal social form into an independent democratic society. The second step is to advance the revolution and establish a socialist society." In the history of the Communist Party of China (CPC), this strategic idea went through an extremely tortuous process from its proposal to its perfection. In fact, whether this strategic idea can be correctly understood and interpreted not only affects the practice of the Chinese revolution but also directly influences the development of the CPC's revolutionary theory.
After the establishment of the CPC, using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as a weapon to observe the destiny of the country, it initially answered the questions faced by the Chinese revolution. In July 1922, the Second National Congress of the Party scientifically analyzed the international and domestic situation and the nature of Chinese society, believing that imperialism and feudalism were the main enemies at that time. The Chinese revolution must first overthrow the rule of imperialism and feudalism, achieve the victory of the democratic revolution, and then carry out the socialist revolution. Based on this, the congress for the first time put forward a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution program in its declaration, which included eliminating internal disturbances, overthrowing warlords, and building internal peace; overthrowing the oppression of international imperialism and achieving complete independence for the Chinese nation; and unifying the main part of China (including the three provinces in the east) into a genuine democratic republic. The congress declaration once again reaffirmed the party's supreme program: "organize the proletariat, establish proletarian dictatorship through class struggle, obliterate the system of private property, gradually achieve a communist society." The idea that the Chinese revolution should be carried out in two steps is closely related to the formulation of the program for the democratic revolution by the Second National Congress of the CPC. The declaration of the Second National Congress stated: the struggle of the proletariat must be divided into two steps, the first step is to "assist the democratic revolution movement," and the second step is to "implement 'proletarian dictatorship in alliance with poor peasants'." "If the proletariat's organizational strength and fighting ability are strong, this second stage of struggle will immediately succeed after the victory of the democratic revolution." The Second National Congress confirmed that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages, and the proletariat must first fight for the completion of the bourgeois democratic revolution. Compared with the proposition of directly carrying out a socialist revolution in China, this was a major progress and played a role in propelling the party and the working class to engage in the democratic revolution. However, the Second National Congress did not clarify the relationship between the democratic revolution and the proletarian revolution.
Although the Second Congress of the Party stated that "the workers are under extreme oppression from both domestic and foreign capitalists, and the revolutionary movement will develop itself. The result of its development will be the emergence of the revolutionary leadership army that will overthrow the world capitalist imperialism in China," the basic understanding of the Second Congress of the CPC is that the proletariat only "assists" and "helps" the democratic revolutionary movement. Of course, this "assistance" and "help" "does not mean the proletariat submits to the bourgeoisie," but rather it is "a necessary step to prevent the prolongation of the feudal system and to develop the real strength of the proletariat." The Second Congress of the Party also believed that "when the democratic revolution succeeds, the proletariat only gains some freedom and rights," and "the naive bourgeoisie will rapidly develop and be in an antagonistic position to the proletariat." At this point, the proletariat must engage in the "second stage of struggle." Regarding this issue, Chen Duxiu further elaborated on it in 1923. He believed that "the proletariat clearly knows that the success of this kind of democratic revolution is indeed a victory for the bourgeoisie. However, the naive proletariat currently only has the opportunity to acquire some freedom and expand its own abilities through this struggle for victory. Therefore, cooperating with the revolutionary bourgeoisie is also the only path for the Chinese proletariat at present." "Under ordinary circumstances, the victory of the national revolution is naturally the victory of the bourgeoisie," and "naturally, the bourgeoisie holds power." The shortcomings of the Second Congress of the Party were later developed by Chen Duxiu into the "theory of the second revolution," becoming the theoretical root of the right-wing error within the Party.
The issue of the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, that is, the issue of the future of the Chinese revolution, was also mentioned during the Fourth Congress of the Party held from January 11 to 22, 1925. The Fourth Congress of the Party stated that the future of the Chinese revolution is a non-capitalist future (although this resolution was originally included in the draft but was later deleted after discussions). However, compared to the understanding of the Second Congress of the Party, the Fourth Congress deepened the formulation of the issue of China's revolution needing to be carried out in two stages. First, it clarified the idea that the proletariat must bear the responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution, stating that "the Chinese national revolutionary movement must have the participation and leadership of the most revolutionary proletariat in order to achieve victory." Second, it questioned whether the capitalist class would immediately seize political power after the victory of the democratic revolution. These two points are interconnected. If these two points are combined for consideration, a clear conclusion could be reached: the democratic revolution led by the proletariat does not have a capitalist future. However, the documents of the Fourth Congress of the Party show that its understanding is still unclear. The resolution states, "after the victory of the national revolution, whether it will be followed by the proletarian revolution, and to what extent the proletariat's revolutionary preparation in the national revolution is necessary, will depend on the objective conditions of the society at that time and will also be greatly influenced by the world political situation." Here, the question of how the victory of the democratic revolution connects to the proletarian revolution is clearly different from the viewpoint that severs the relationship between the two as proposed by the theory of the second revolution. However, this statement only questions the insertion of a capitalist stage between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, whether it is necessary to pass through the bourgeois democratic system, which depends on the circumstances. In other words, it does not exclude the possibility of a capitalist future. At the same time, the Fourth Congress of the Party did not provide concrete answers on how to realize the leadership of the proletariat, especially how to correctly handle the various complex issues in the struggle for leadership with the bourgeoisie, and it also lacked sufficient understanding of the extreme importance of power and armed forces. These weaknesses gradually became apparent in the subsequent development of the revolutionary movement.
Although some Marxists within the party, such as Deng Zhongxia, Zhou Enlai, Li Dazhao, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Qu Qiubai, Yan'an English, Cai Hesen, and Xiao Chuyu, published articles before and after the Fourth National Congress of the Communist Party, criticizing the erroneous theories of the rightists within the Kuomintang and Chen Duxiu from different angles, analyzing the economic status and political attitudes of various classes in Chinese society, studying the practical problems and characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and actively exploring the basic laws of the Chinese revolution under the guidance of Marxism. For example, Deng Zhongxia pointed out in his article "Several Important Issues in the Period of Labor Revival" published in May 1925: "The proletariat's participation in the national revolution is not to join the bourgeoisie, but to participate for the purpose of its own class; therefore, we should take the interests of our own class as a premise in the national revolution." Mao Zedong published "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" in October 1925 in the magazine "Revolution", "Analysis of the Classes in the Chinese Peasantry and Their Attitudes towards the Revolution" in January 1926 in the journal "Chinese Farmers", "The Reasons for the Separation of the Rightists within the Kuomintang and Their Impact on the Future of the Revolution" in the "Political Weekly", and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" in March in the "Chinese Youth". Using the Marxist class analysis method, he analyzed the various classes in Chinese society, expounded on the tasks, targets, leadership, driving forces, and prospects of the Chinese revolution, and put forward the basic ideas of the new-democratic revolution. However, these correct insights did not dominate the party's leadership. It wasn't until the end of 1926 that the "theory of the second revolution" was still the majority and formal opinion within the Communist Party's guiding organs. The fatal mistake of the "theory of the second revolution" was voluntarily giving up or not making efforts to strive for the leadership of the proletarian class and the Communist Party in the revolution, and making right-wing mistakes at the critical moment of the revolution, which led to the failure of the first great revolution.
II. The systematic formation of the "two-step strategy" concept
At the end of 1926, the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International passed the Resolution on the Chinese Situation, which pointed out: "Although the current stage of the development of the Chinese revolution is historically of the nature of a bourgeois democratic revolution, it must be accompanied by a broad social movement. The result of the Chinese revolution may not necessarily create a socio-political environment for the development of capitalism. The process of the Chinese revolution is part of the general struggle to eliminate capitalism and build socialism in the era of the decline of capitalism. The structure of the revolutionary country will depend on its class foundation. This revolutionary country will not be a purely bourgeois democratic country but will become a dictatorship of the proletariat, the peasantry, and other exploited classes. It will become an anti-imperialist government in the period of transition to non-capitalism (socialism)." "The Chinese Communist Party has decided to devote all its efforts to realizing the revolutionary future of transition to non-capitalism." The Communist International put forward the issue of the "non-capitalist future" of the Chinese revolution in a prominent way. From the end of 1926 to the beginning of 1927, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed the issue of the connection between two stages of the Chinese revolution and formulated an internal party document titled "Explanation by the Politburo of the Central Committee on the Resolution of the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Communist International on the China Question." The Politburo of the Central Committee accepted the instructions of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, reviewed the errors of the "theory of the second revolution," and provided explanations for the international instructions. The Politburo of the Central Committee believed that there was a "fundamental error" in the Party Central Committee's past understanding of the Chinese revolution, which was to "draw a great 'natural insurmountable' divide between the national revolution and the proletarian revolution"; if the national revolution and the proletarian revolution were completely separated into two disconnected periods, and if the old framework was adhered to in the national revolution and depicted with it, the "national revolution" would be "doomed." According to the international instructions and the domestic and international conditions in China, the "development of the future of the Chinese national revolution must surpass bourgeois democratic revolution.The success of the national revolution led by the proletariat does not need to create a political environment for the development of capitalism, but rather to create a political environment for the transition from capitalism to non-capitalism (socialism).... to march towards socialism. It should be regarded "as the entire Chinese revolution," "grasp the link between these two revolutions and make them seamless," and "not subjectively determine that we must have the fate of a second revolution and prepare for a second revolution."
This explanation by the Central Political Bureau officially rejected the previous view of the "theory of two revolutions" that severed the connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, organically connecting the issue of proletarian leadership with the issue of the two revolutionary stages, considering the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution as a whole, and contemplating how to create a non-capitalist development. This is its correctness. However, this explanation believes that the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution can be carried out seamlessly and that there is no need to "prepare for a second revolution," which is incorrect. This shows that the Central Committee of the CPC at that time had not yet correctly distinguished and connected the two stages of the Chinese revolution and had not found the correct path to achieve a non-capitalist future.
The viewpoint of "one revolution" confuses the nature and stage boundaries of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, attempting to complete both revolutionary tasks in one step, reflecting a "left" impatience. But at the same time, it also contains valuable ideas that have been proved by later facts, that is: after the proletariat goes through the democratic revolution, it must establish a democratic power of the working class and peasants, and seize the highest economic power from imperialism, warlords, bureaucrats, and compradors; the revolution of the proletariat seizing power only happens once, and the Chinese democratic revolution will not lead to a situation where the bourgeoisie holds power like the French Revolution. In summary, the future of the Chinese revolution is socialism, not capitalism. These signify progress in the theoretical thinking of the Chinese Communists. However, at that time, the errors in the "one revolution theory" became increasingly prominent and continued to develop, leading to the "left" error of wanting to simultaneously eliminate the bourgeoisie during the stage of the democratic revolution. After 1927, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, and Wang Ming all made the same mistake of the "one revolution theory" in understanding the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, leading to the dominance of "left" thinking in the central leadership of the Party and causing serious harm to the revolutionary cause.
During the land revolution war, Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "The Struggle in Jinggangshan": "China is currently in the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution. The program of a thorough democratic revolution in China includes the overthrow of imperialism and achieving complete national liberation externally; it also includes eradicating the comprador class's influence in the cities, carrying out land revolution, eliminating feudal relations in the countryside, and overthrowing the warlord government internally. This kind of bourgeois democratic revolution must be carried out to create a true foundation for the transition to socialism." After that, in the second National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers held in January 1934, Mao Zedong also discussed the economic policies of the red zones. He pointed out: "Our economic policy principle is to carry out all possible and necessary economic construction, concentrate economic forces for the war, at the same time vigorously improve the living conditions of the people, consolidate the unity of the workers and peasants economically, ensure the leadership of the proletariat over the peasants, strive for the leadership of state-owned economy over private economy, and create the prerequisites for future development towards socialism. However, at that time, most of Mao Zedong's ideas were triggered by the correct guidance of the Communist International, and they were the initial results of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong's idea of the Chinese revolution proceeding in "two steps" was still in its infancy and at an early stage of formation.
However, in order to "make further progress in our work," we must "make further progress in the great cause of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution." After the entry of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression into the stalemate stage, the struggle task of the Chinese Communist Party on the ideological front was very heavy.The stubborn faction of the Kuomintang propagates that recognizing the Three Principles of the People means abandoning communism. Some representatives of the national bourgeoisie, although expressing dissatisfaction with the KMT's dictatorial rule and ineffective resistance against the Japanese, still have doubts about the Communist Party's proposals and the future of the anti-Japanese war. They try to find another political path outside the political propositions of the KMT and the Communist Party, and aim to establish a bourgeois republic in China modeled after Europe and the United States. Even within the Communist Party and revolutionary ranks, there are some individuals who lack understanding of the theory and policies of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the task of explaining the party's complete understanding of the Chinese revolution to the entire party and the people of the whole country is crucially important for Chinese Communists. Mao Zedong conducted in-depth and systematic studies on the issue of "taking two steps in the Chinese revolution" in response to the aforementioned situation. In Yan'an, Mao Zedong carried out a large amount of theoretical research on this issue, systematically summarizing the positive and negative experiences of the Chinese revolution, bringing together the wisdom of the entire party, and subsequently writing works such as "The Manifesto of the Communist Party," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "On New Democracy." The publication of these works marked the systematic formation of the strategic idea of the "two-step approach" in the Chinese revolution.
Section 3: The Nature and Basic Characteristics of the New Democratic Revolution
Colonial and semi-colonial countries must go through the stage of democracy to reach socialism. This is a difficult and complex path for the proletarian revolution. Why is the proletarian revolution in these countries a democratic revolution as the first step according to its social nature? After the victory of the proletarian-led democratic revolution, it is still not possible to immediately transition to socialism. So what is its immediate future? If it is not socialism, why is the socialist revolution the inevitable trend of the new democratic revolution? These are some of the questions that the theory of new democracy aims to answer and solve. The scientific clarification of these questions constitutes the basic principles of new democracy.
I. The Basic Content of the Nature of the New Democratic Revolution
The nature of the new democratic revolution is a bourgeois democratic revolution, not a proletarian socialist revolution. Mao Zedong pointed out in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" that what kind of revolution is the current stage of the Chinese revolution? It is clearly not the latter, but the former, namely a bourgeois democratic revolution. Based on a thorough understanding of the social characteristics of China, Mao Zedong pointed out that since Chinese society is still a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, and since the main enemies of the Chinese revolution are imperialism and feudal forces, and since the goal of the Chinese revolution is to overthrow these two main enemies through national revolution and democratic revolution, and even if the bourgeoisie betrays the revolution and becomes an enemy of the revolution, the revolutionary struggle is still not directed against general capitalism and private property, but against imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, the nature of the Chinese revolution at the current stage is not proletarian socialist but bourgeois democratic. However, the bourgeois democratic revolution in China at this stage is no longer the old-style general bourgeois democratic revolution that has become outdated. Instead, it is a new and special bourgeois democratic revolution. This revolution is developing in China and all other colonial and semi-colonial countries, and we call this revolution the "new democratic revolution." This new democratic revolution is part of the world proletarian socialist revolution and resolutely opposes imperialism, which is international capitalism. Politically, it is the dictatorship of several revolutionary classes united against imperialists and reactionary traitors, opposing the transformation of Chinese society into a bourgeois dictatorship. Economically, it involves nationalizing the large capital enterprises owned by imperialists and reactionary traitors while distributing the land belonging to the landlord class to the peasants, while also maintaining the existence of general private capitalist enterprises and not abolishing the economy of the rich peasants.Therefore, this new type of democratic revolution, while on one hand clears the way for capitalism, on the other hand creates the conditions for socialism. The current revolutionary stage in China aims to end the colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, and establish a socialist society. It is a transitional phase in the process of new democratic revolution.
So, when did this process begin? Mao Zedong said that this process started after the First World War and the October Revolution in Russia, and in China, it started with the May Fourth Movement in 1919. The so-called new democratic revolution is a revolution led by the proletariat and the masses against imperialism and feudalism. China's society must go through this revolution in order to further develop into a socialist society; otherwise, it is not possible. Mao Zedong pointed out that China's new democratic revolution is fundamentally different from the democratic revolutions in European and American history. It does not lead to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, but rather leads to the united front dictatorship of various revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the anti-Japanese democratic political power established in the various anti-Japanese base areas led by the Communist Party of China was the political power of the anti-Japanese national united front. It is not the dictatorship of one class, either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat, but the dictatorship formed by several revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat. Anyone who supports anti-Japanese and democracy, regardless of party or faction, has the qualification to participate in this political power. On the other hand, this new democratic revolution is also different from the socialist revolution. It only overthrows the rule of imperialism and the reactionary comprador class in China, without destroying any capitalist elements that can still participate in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle.
Mao Zedong emphasized that this new democratic revolution is basically consistent with Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People advocated in 1924. In the "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang" issued by Sun Yat-sen in that year, he said, "The so-called civil rights system in modern countries is often monopolized by the bourgeoisie, becoming a tool of oppressing the common people. If the civil rights ideology of the Kuomintang is for the common people, not for a few individuals." He also said, "For enterprises owned by both Chinese and foreign nationals, if they are of a monopolistic nature or of a scale that cannot be managed by individual efforts, such as banks, railways, and sea routes, they should be operated and managed by the state, so that the capitalist system cannot manipulate the livelihood of the people. This is the essence of controlling capital." Sun Yat-sen also pointed out in his will that "it is necessary to arouse the masses and unite with nations that treat us equally in the world to fight together" as the fundamental principles of domestic and foreign policies. All of these transformed the old Three Principles of the People, which were suited to the old international and domestic conditions, into the new Three Principles of the People suited to the new international and domestic conditions. In the declaration issued by the Communist Party of China on September 22, 1937, it stated that "the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and our party is willing to struggle for their thorough realization." It refers to this kind of Three Principles of the People, not any other version. This version of the Three Principles of the People is Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, which are the policy of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for peasants and workers. Under the new international and domestic conditions, without the three major policies, the Three Principles of the People will not be revolutionary. Therefore, in China's bourgeois democratic revolution, whether in terms of its struggle front (united front) or its national composition, the positions of the proletariat, the peasant class, and other petty bourgeoisie cannot be ignored. Anyone who wants to disregard China's proletariat, peasant class, and other petty bourgeoisie will inevitably fail to solve the destiny of the Chinese nation and any problems in China. The democratic republic that the current stage of China's revolution aims to establish must be a democratic republic where workers, peasants, and other petty bourgeoisie have a certain position and play a certain role. In other words, it is a democratic republic that is a revolutionary alliance of workers, peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and all other anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces. Only under the leadership of the proletariat is the complete realization of this republic possible.
II. Basic Characteristics of the Nature of the New Democratic Revolution
Based on a full understanding of the nature of the new democratic revolution, the Party has summarized the basic characteristics of this revolutionary nature and further deepened its understanding of the new democratic revolution. The new democratic revolution is a "part of the socialist world revolution of the proletariat" and is the "ally of the socialist revolution front of the world". The Communist Party of China pointed out in its profound analysis of the historical characteristics of the new democratic revolution that the historical characteristics of the new democratic revolution did not exist since the Opium War, but formed later, after the First World War and the October Revolution in Russia. Mao Zedong once again emphasized that the nature of China's current society, being a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, determines that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages: the first stage is to change this colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal social form and transform it into an independent democratic society; the second stage is to further develop the revolution and establish a socialist society. The current revolution in China is in the first stage. This preparatory stage for the first step began since the Opium War in 1840, when Chinese society began to change from a feudal society to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Through the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War, the Hundred Days' Reform, the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolution, and the ongoing War of Resistance Against Japan, there have been many individual stages, about a hundred years in total, which, from a certain point of view, all serve this first step, and the Chinese people have implemented this first step at different times and to different degrees, struggling against imperialism and feudal forces in order to establish an independent democratic society and complete the first revolution. The Xinhai Revolution was the beginning of this revolution in a more comprehensive sense. As for the nature of this revolution, it is a bourgeois democratic revolution, not a proletarian socialist revolution. This revolution is still unfinished and requires great efforts, because its enemies are still very powerful. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard," he referred to this bourgeois democratic revolution. However, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution has undergone a change since the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and the establishment of a socialist state on one-sixth of the earth's land with the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. Prior to this, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution belonged to the category of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution, and it was a part of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution. After this, the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution changed to belong to the category of the new bourgeois democratic revolution, and in terms of the revolutionary front, it became a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. Mao Zedong pointed out that the most direct reason for this change was the First World War and the first victorious socialist October Revolution, which changed the direction of the entire world history and divided the epochs of world history.
In an era where the capitalist front of the world has collapsed in one corner of the globe, which occupies one-sixth of the world's land, and where its decay has already been fully revealed in the remaining corners, in an era where the capitalist sections that survive cannot survive without relying more on colonies and semi-colonies, in an era where socialist countries have been established and declared their willingness to support all liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, in an era where the proletariat in various capitalist countries are gradually freeing themselves from the influence of social democratic parties of social imperialism and declaring their support for liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, in such an era, any colony or semi-colony, if it experiences a revolution against imperialism, against the international bourgeoisie, against international capitalism, it is no longer part of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution, but belongs to a new category; it is no longer part of the old world revolution of the bourgeoisie and capitalism, but part of the new world revolution, the proletarian socialist world revolution. These colonial and semi-colonial revolutions of this kind can no longer be regarded as allies of the counter-revolutionary front of world capitalism, but have become allies of the revolutionary front of world socialism. Despite its social nature, the first stage and first step of this colonial and semi-colonial revolution still fundamentally remain bourgeois democratic, but their objective demand is to pave the way for the development of capitalism; however, this revolution is no longer the old revolution led by the bourgeoisie, aimed at establishing a capitalist society and bourgeois dictatorship, but is a new revolution led by the proletariat, aimed at establishing a new democratic society in the first stage and establishing a united front dictatorship of various revolutionary classes. 
Therefore, this revolution also clears a broader path for the development of socialism. This revolution, due to changes in the enemy situation and allies, is divided into several stages during its course, but its basic nature does not change. This revolution is a thorough attack on imperialism, so it is not allowed by imperialism but opposed by it. However, it is allowed by socialism and supported by socialist countries and the international proletarians of socialism. Therefore, this revolution cannot help but become part of the proletarian socialist world revolution. Mao Zedong reviewed the process of proposing the idea that "the Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution" in On New Democracy. He pointed out that "the Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution" was already proposed during the first Great Revolution in China from 1924 to 1927. This proposition was put forward by Chinese Communists and was approved by all those who participated in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism at that time. However, at that time, the significance of this theory had not yet been realized, so people only had a vague understanding of this issue. Mao Zedong said that this "world revolution" is no longer the old world revolution, as the old bourgeois world revolution has already come to an end; it is a new world revolution, a socialist world revolution. Similarly, this "part" is no longer part of the old bourgeois revolution, but part of the new socialist revolution. This is a tremendous change, an incomparable change in world and Chinese history. Mao Zedong also specifically mentioned that the correct proposition of "the Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution" put forward by Chinese Communists was based on the theory of Stalin.
Stalin said in his 1918 article "The October Revolution and the National Question" commemorating the first anniversary of the October Revolution: "The great world significance of the October Revolution is primarily twofold: first, it broadened the scope of the national question, transforming it from a local issue of struggle against national oppression in Europe into a universal problem of liberation for all oppressed nations, colonies, and semi-colonies from imperialism; second, it opened up vast possibilities and realistic paths for this liberation, greatly advancing the liberation movement of oppressed nations in the West and the East, attracting them to the powerful current of anti-imperialist struggle for victory; third, it thus bridged the gap between socialist Western countries and the enslaved East, establishing a revolutionary front against world imperialism from Western proletarians through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East." Since this article, Stalin has repeatedly emphasized that the revolutionary struggle for colonies and semi-colonies has escaped the old confines and become part of the proletarian socialist revolution. The most clear and definite exposition of this was in his article "Once Again on the National Question," which he published on June 30, 1925, during a debate with Yugoslav nationalists at the time. Hence, there are two types of world revolution: the first kind belongs to the category of the bourgeoisie and capitalism. This kind of world revolution has long since passed. It ended in 1914 with the outbreak of the First Imperialist World War, especially with the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. Since then, the second kind of world revolution began, namely the proletarian socialist world revolution. This revolution takes the proletariats of capitalist countries as the main force and the oppressed nations of colonies and semi-colonies as their allies. Regardless of the class, party, or individual participating in the revolution in the oppressed nations, and regardless of their conscious or unconscious understanding of this point, as long as they oppose imperialism, their revolution becomes part of the proletarian socialist world revolution, and they become allies of the proletarian socialist world revolution.
Facing the rapid development of the Chinese Revolution, Mao Zedong said: "Today, it is during the time when the world is being dragged into the Second World War day by day due to the economic crisis and political crisis of capitalism; it is when the Soviet Union has reached the transitional period from socialism to communism, and is capable of leading and assisting the proletariat and oppressed nations of the world, resisting imperialist wars and striking capitalist reaction; it is when the proletariat of various capitalist countries is preparing to overthrow capitalism and achieve socialism; it is when the proletariat, the peasant class, intellectuals, and other petty bourgeoisie in China have, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, formed a great independent political force. Today, we are in such a time, so should we not consider that the global significance of the Chinese Revolution has increased even more? I believe that we should. The Chinese Revolution is a great part of the world revolution. The first stage of this Chinese Revolution (which is divided into many smaller stages) has the social nature of a new-style bourgeois democratic revolution, not yet a proletarian socialist revolution, but it has long become part of the proletarian socialist world revolution and now it has become a great part of this world revolution, becoming a great ally of this world revolution. The first step, the first stage of this revolution, is neither to establish a capitalist society of the bourgeoisie's dictatorship in China, nor can it achieve such a society; instead, it is to establish a new democratic society under the joint dictatorship of the Chinese revolutionary classes led by the Chinese proletariat, and to complete its first stage. Then, it will further develop into the second stage, to establish a socialist society in China. This is the most fundamental characteristic of the current Chinese Revolution, the new revolutionary process in the past twenty years (counting from the May Fourth Movement in 1919), and the vivid and concrete content of the current Chinese Revolution."
Since the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the leaders of the Chinese revolution have been the proletariat. Mao Zedong pointed out that before the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the political leaders of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution were the Chinese petite bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie (their intellectuals). After the May Fourth Movement, although the Chinese national bourgeoisie continued to participate in the revolution, the political leaders of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution were no longer part of the Chinese bourgeoisie, but belonged to the Chinese proletariat. There are two reasons for this: first, the preparatory stage of the Chinese democratic revolution began with the Opium War. Second, the Xinhai Revolution led by the bourgeoisie "truly started this revolution." The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system, established the Republic, and made great achievements. However, it only drove away an emperor, hung up a "Republic" sign, and China was still under the oppression of imperialism and feudalism. The revolutionary task of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism was not completed. The main reason why China's bourgeoisie could not fulfill their historical mission like the bourgeoisie of European and American countries, especially the bourgeoisie of France, is because "they are exceptionally weak economically and politically." This weakness was formed during the process of China becoming a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, it is a "deep-rooted ailment" brought about from birth, an inherent flaw that is difficult to overcome. Because of their weakness, they often compromise with the enemies of the revolution. The Chinese national bourgeoisie, "even during the revolution, is unwilling to completely separate from imperialism, and they are closely connected to rent exploitation in the countryside, so they are unwilling and unable to completely overthrow imperialism, let alone completely overthrow feudal forces." In this way, the two fundamental problems and tasks of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution cannot be resolved by the Chinese national bourgeoisie. As for the big bourgeoisie in China, represented by the Kuomintang, during the long period from 1927 to 1937, they colluded with imperialism and feudalism and opposed the revolutionary people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, some of them, represented by Wang Jingwei, openly surrendered to the Japanese invaders, "showing a new betrayal by the big bourgeoisie." In short, "on one hand - the possibility of participating in the revolution, and on the other hand - the compromise with the enemies of the revolution, this is the dual nature of the Chinese bourgeoisie." This dual nature is the fundamental reason why the Chinese bourgeoisie cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory. However, on the other hand, the development of the revolutionary movement requires and always finds new leaders. Just when the revolutionary faction of the Chinese bourgeoisie was defeated, the growing Chinese working class finally stepped onto the stage of China's political struggle after the May Fourth Movement. Although the Chinese working class is small in number and has its flaws, it is the most progressive, promising, and militant class in Chinese society. With its organizational discipline, natural connection with the peasants, and especially the leadership of its vanguard - the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class bravely took on the responsibility of leading the Chinese democratic revolution. 
Therefore, Mao Zedong said, "After the May Fourth Movement, although the Chinese national bourgeoisie continued to participate in the revolution, the political leaders of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution no longer belonged to the Chinese bourgeoisie, but belonged to the Chinese proletariat." From this, it can be seen that the change in the leading class in the process of the Chinese democratic revolution is an inevitable result of historical development, a choice made by history. In this way, although the revolutions before and after the May Fourth Movement were both bourgeois democratic revolutions, they showed "important differences." After the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat and its political party, and guided by Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese democratic revolution quickly showed a new appearance. It not only surpassed the May Fourth Movement in terms of the breadth and depth of the revolution, but especially in terms of the completeness and thoroughness of the revolution. Its political program, economic program, and cultural program all differ greatly from the previous period.It not only realizes the established task of the democratic revolution of the Chinese bourgeoisie, but also creates premises and conditions for the next step of the socialist revolution. 
It is in these senses that Mao Zedong referred to the democratic revolution before the May Fourth Movement as the "old-style general bourgeois democratic revolution," that is, the old democratic revolution, and the democratic revolution after the May Fourth Movement as the "new-style specific bourgeois democratic revolution," that is, the new democratic revolution. Therefore, the change in leadership is the most important change in the development process of the Chinese democratic revolution. The leadership of the proletariat becomes the most important characteristic of the new democratic revolution in China. The ultimate future of the Chinese revolution is not capitalist, but the future of socialist and communist revolution in China. It is the question of the relationship between the bourgeois democratic revolution and the proletarian socialist revolution, as well as the relationship between the current stage and the future stage of the Chinese revolution. In May 1937, at the National Party Congress of the Communist Party of China held in Yan'an, Mao Zedong said in response to the question of the future of the Chinese revolution that the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution are like "two articles, the first and the second. Only when the first article is done well can the second article be done well. Firmly leading the democratic revolution is a condition for winning socialism." "We are advocates of revolutionary transformation," Mao said, advocating "the transformation of the democratic revolution in the direction of socialism," but this must be when the conditions are ripe. Mao Zedong refuted Trotskyism's "theory of permanent revolution," which had caused harm to the Chinese revolution, as well as tailism, adventurism, and revolutionary impetuosity, and demanded that Communist Party members both understand the future of the revolution and strive for the tasks of the current stage. He said, "The current efforts are directed toward the future goals, and without these goals, one is not a Communist Party member. However, if one relaxes today's efforts, one is also not a Communist Party member." Afterwards, Mao Zedong further expounded on the above ideas in a more comprehensive and systematic manner in "On the Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," succinctly summarizing the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and providing clear answers to the issue of China's future.
Mao Zedong pointed out that since the democratic revolution of the Chinese bourgeoisie at the present stage is not a general old-style bourgeois democratic revolution, but a specific new-style democratic revolution, a new democratic revolution, and the Chinese revolution is in a new international environment of the 1930s and 1940s, a time of upsurge in socialism and decline in capitalism, in the era of the Second World War and revolution, then there is no doubt about the ultimate future of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong believed that since the current stage of the Chinese revolution is for changing the status of the present colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, that is, for the completion of a new democratic revolution, then after the revolution is victorious, because the obstacles to the development of capitalism have been eliminated, it is imaginable and not surprising that capitalist economy will develop to a certain degree in Chinese society. The development of capitalism to a certain degree is an unavoidable result of China's backwardness after the victory of the democratic revolution. However, this is only one aspect of the result of the Chinese revolution, not its entirety. The whole result of the Chinese revolution is: on one hand, the development of capitalist elements, and on the other hand, the development of socialist elements. What are these socialist elements? They are the increasing proportion of the proletariat and the Communist Party in the national political forces, the recognition of the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party by the farmers, intellectuals, and urban petite bourgeoisie, and the state-owned economy and cooperative economy of the democratic republic. All of this constitutes socialist elements. With the favorable international environment, the final result of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution, avoiding the future of capitalism and realizing the future of socialism, must have great possibilities.
From this we can see that the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution is the relationship between the present and the future. Their differences reflect the particularity of contradictions. Their connections reflect the unity of contradictions. The Chinese revolution is a complex contradiction that includes these two revolutionary stages. In the face of this situation, the Communist Party of China "can only lead the Chinese revolution correctly by recognizing the differences between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and at the same time recognizing the connection between the two."
In general, in terms of the international front, the new democratic revolution is an ally of the socialist revolution of the world proletariat, not an ally of the world bourgeois revolution; in terms of the leadership of the revolution, the new democratic revolution is led by the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie; in terms of the future development prospects of the revolution, the future of the new democratic revolution is socialism, not capitalism. These are the main characteristics of the Chinese new democratic revolution.
General Line of the New Democratic Revolution
Section 1 Formation of the Party's View on the Analysis of the Chinese Social Class Structure
I. Correctly analyzing the tasks of various social classes
After the First National Congress of the Party, both the national crisis and the domestic political crisis continued to deepen. The Party concentrated its forces to launch and lead the workers' movement and actively carried out the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and the revolution rapidly developed. However, there were various views on social and political issues, such as "armed unification," "provincial autonomy," "good person government," and so on. The basic issues of the revolution's enemies, driving forces, tasks, and nature urgently need to be clarified, and all of these are based on a correct understanding and analysis of the various social classes in China.
The Second National Congress of the Party's "Manifesto of the Chinese Communist Party's Second National Congress" (hereinafter referred to as the "Manifesto") made a preliminary analysis of the bourgeoisie, peasants, petite bourgeoisie, and the working class. It pointed out that the naive bourgeoisie would have to rise up against imperialism to alleviate the economic oppression of imperialism and feudal warlords. Peasants were divided into three parts: wealthy peasant landlords, independent small farmers, and tenant farmers and agricultural laborers. The first group accounted for the smallest number, while the second and third groups accounted for at least 95%, and they were oppressed and exploited, and a revolution was necessary for them. This was the "greatest element" of the revolution. The petite bourgeoisie was numerous in number, living in hardship, increasingly unemployed, and would inevitably join the revolution. The working class was "extremely oppressed by foreign and domestic capitalists," and its revolutionary movement would develop itself and become a "great force of revolution" and the "leading revolutionary army" against imperialism and feudalism. Based on the above analysis, the "Manifesto" identified feudal warlords and imperialism as enemies of the revolution on one side, and the working class, peasants, petite bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie as forces of revolution on the other side, clearly proposing to overthrow the oppression of imperialism and the rule of warlords and formulate the party's democratic revolution program. In this way, in the context of diverse political views, the basic issues of the revolution's targets, driving forces, tasks, nature, and so on were clarified for the first time.
The Third National Congress of the Party made important decisions on the united front with the Guomindang in the "Resolution of the Third National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party" (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution"). Based on the analysis of the economic and political situation of society and the analysis of peasants and the working class, it focused on the analysis of the bourgeoisie and the Guomindang. Firstly, it believed that the middle class had contradictions with imperialism and warlords. The "Resolution" divided the bourgeoisie into big merchants (i.e. financiers) and the middle class, pointing out that big merchants, like bureaucrats, were profiteers. Due to the plunder, occupation of the market, and seizure of raw materials by imperialism, the middle class nearly cut off "the possibility of development" for China's heavy industry, leading to "deviated development" of its commerce.
"The ruling class in China was feudal warlords, not the bourgeoisie," and "the majority of the middle class" faces political oppression. Therefore, there is inevitably a conflict "with international imperialism and the warlords based in Beijing." Second, it is pointed out that among the existing parties in China, only the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) is relatively a party of national revolution, and it is difficult to establish a party larger and more revolutionary than the Kuomintang given the current situation of various social classes. Third, however, the bourgeoisie "takes advantage of imperialism or warlords and easily compromises and betrays the common people." The Kuomintang also harbors illusions about imperialism and warlords, concentrating all its efforts on military actions and alienating from the masses. The "Resolution" not only analyzes the revolutionary aspects of the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang, but also provides a preliminary analysis of their compromising and non-revolutionary aspects. Based on this, a decision is made to cooperate with the Kuomintang, thus formulating the Party's basic strategic policy for democratic revolution. Although the "Resolution" was influenced by the Communist International and Chen Duxiu's right-wing thinking, which regarded the Kuomintang as the revolutionary "central force" and "leader," leading to a right-leaning misconception on the issue of revolutionary leadership, the Third National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party established the strategic policy of the united front for revolution, indicating a new leap in the Party's understanding.
During this stage, Chen Duxiu wrote three articles: "On Building a Nation" (September 1922), "The Revolution of the Bourgeoisie and the Bourgeoisie of the Revolution" (April 1923), and "The Chinese National Revolution and Various Social Classes" (December 1923). These three articles are important components of the Party's class analysis and understanding during this period. These three articles have three characteristics in their analysis of various social classes: they point out that imperialism and feudal warlords are always the enemies of the revolution, which is the first characteristic. The bourgeoisie is divided into three parts: the revolutionary bourgeoisie, the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, and the non-revolutionary bourgeoisie. It is pointed out that emerging industrial and commercial capitalists support the revolution because their business development is hindered by imperialism and warlords; bureaucratic capitalists oppose the revolution because they are attached to imperialism and warlords; small industrial and commercial capitalists, due to their small business scale and competition, may take a neutral or tend towards the revolution due to precarious livelihoods. This is the second characteristic. The strengths and weaknesses of the peasant and working class are analyzed. It is pointed out that peasants account for the majority of China's population and are subjected to the plunder of imperialism and the exploitation of feudal gentry. They are likely to join the revolution, which represents a great force for revolution. Without the participation of peasants, the democratic revolution cannot succeed. However, peasants are scattered, lack concentration, have low education levels, and are conservative. Especially self-sufficient peasants, their firm belief in private ownership prevents them from surpassing the mindset of transferring landlord's private ownership to their own. This is why it is difficult for peasants to join the revolution. The working class is an "important component" in the democratic revolution, and their revolutionary tendencies are greater than those of the bourgeoisie. Only a few workers with class political consciousness are truly the vanguard of the revolution. However, some workers' thinking is still trapped in the patriarchal society, with strong clan and localistic views, and they have not yet overcome their superstitious belief in the divine right of kings. The number of politically conscious workers is "really too small". If the working class only engages in pure economic struggles, it has "no significant meaning." Only by engaging in direct political struggles against imperialism and warlords can they have significant meaning. This is the third characteristic. Chen Duxiu's analysis, to a certain extent, played a positive role in the Party's analysis of various social classes.
However, Chen Duxiu's class analysis contains right-wing erroneous views.This mainly manifests in the wavering, compromise, non-revolutionary, or even counter-revolutionary aspects of the emerging bourgeoisie in industry and commerce. Insufficient analysis has been conducted on the advantages and role of the working class, leading to the erroneous belief that the power of the bourgeoisie is greater than that of the proletariat, that the working class and peasants are less capable of revolution than the bourgeoisie, and that the leaders of the national revolution are the bourgeoisie rather than the proletariat. This has resulted in the serious ideological root of the right-wing opportunism errors after Chen Duxiu. 
From the above, it can be seen that the Party began analyzing the various classes in society and, based on a preliminary understanding of their economic conditions and political attitudes, delineated the boundaries of revolutionary targets and revolutionary forces, and determined the Party's democratic revolution program and strategic guidelines. However, there was an underestimation of the working class and peasants, and an overestimation of the bourgeoisie, leading to an unclear understanding of the issue of friends, and the emergence of right-wing views on the issue of revolutionary leaders. 
II. The Party's initial development of class analysis perspectives 
The establishment of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation propelled the revolution into a new stage of development. In the united front, the class relations between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have emerged, and the fundamental issue of this relationship lies in who is the revolutionary leader. The Chinese Communist Party did not have a correct understanding of this issue in the past, and now there are two erroneous tendencies: the "left" tendency believes that the proletarian political party should engage in a Soviet-style proletarian revolution and does not need to lead the bourgeois democratic revolution, while the right-wing tendency believes that the bourgeois democratic revolution should be led by the bourgeoisie. In reality, both of them acknowledge that the bourgeoisie is the leader of the national revolution. To correct these two mistaken understandings and clarify the leading position of the proletariat in the democratic revolution, the Party conducted a significant amount of class analysis. 
In December 1923 and November 1924, Deng Zhongxia respectively wrote two articles titled "The Situation of Chinese Workers and Our Movement's Guidelines" and "The Strength of the Chinese Working Class," focusing on the analysis of the working class. The articles pointed out that the emergence and development of modern industry in China and the emergence and growth of the working class demonstrate the historical significance of the working class being connected to the new mode of production. "China's proletariat has blatantly formed a strong and great force as a result of the progress of industry over the past thirty to forty years and has turned around to 'betray' imperialism and launch a counterattack." The strength of the proletariat can now be "verified" and will also not be difficult to "estimate" in the future. It is ultimately the greatest force in China's revolutionary movement. No one can deny its "leadership position." This is the first point. It points out the advantages of the working class while also acknowledging its shortcomings and emphasizing its revolutionary nature. Deng Zhongxia pointed out that Chinese workers are cheap labor for foreign capital, working long hours without seeing the sun, earning low wages, with an average income of only a few cents and "working like oxen and horses for others." Therefore, the consciousness of the working class is determined by its oppressed and exploited status, and "such consciousness cannot be prevented by its feudal social mentality and logic." This is the second point. Summarizing the lessons learned from the failure of the May 4th Movement, the historical role of the working class is fully affirmed. Deng Zhongxia pointed out, "After the May 4th Movement strike failed, I said, 'The working masses hold the main force position in both the democratic revolution and the social revolution,' and 'We should be extremely optimistic.'"He criticized some people who excessively doubted the power of the working class, pointing out: just because you face a little setback, you think this path is impassable, and you want to take another path. It is afraid that even if you have another revolution for ten thousand years, it will not be successful. This is the third point.
Through the analysis of the proletariat, Deng Zhongxia clearly raised the issue of the revolutionary leadership position of the proletariat, pointing out: "The leaders of China's future social revolution are undoubtedly the proletariat, and even the current leaders of the national revolution are also the proletariat." "It is only qualified to be the leader of the national revolution." In December 1924, Peng Shu listed published an article entitled "Who is the leader of China's national revolution?" The article divided the bourgeoisie into three parts: the banking bourgeoisie, the commercial bourgeoisie, and the industrial bourgeoisie. It pointed out: the banking bourgeoisie "is bound to be counter-revolutionary." Among the commercial bourgeoisie, the comprador class is "the fascist of counter-revolution," and the native bourgeoisie needs revolution due to various oppressions from imperialism and warlords but "it is impossible to lead other classes." The development of the industrial bourgeoisie conflicts more with the interests of imperialism in the economy and is hindered by warlords. It is "necessary for revolution," but its "economic foundation is weak" and its "strength is too weak." Therefore, "the counter-revolutionary elements prevail in China's bourgeoisie," and "it is difficult for the bourgeoisie to participate in the national revolution, and it is not a dream for them to become the leaders of the national revolution." Secondly, an analysis of the working class and peasants was conducted. The article pointed out that the working class is directly oppressed and exploited by imperialism and warlords, more severely than any other class. Therefore, its understanding of imperialism and warlords is clearer and deeper than any other class. This is the "only objective condition and fundamental reason for the working class to assume the leadership of the Chinese national revolution." "The Chinese working class is naturally the leader of the national revolution." The peasants want a revolution, but they can only be led by other classes. The article believes that the leader of the national revolution is the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie, which is correct, but it thinks that the working class is naturally in the revolutionary leadership position and that the bourgeoisie cannot naturally be the leader of the revolution. It eliminates the struggle for leadership between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and slackens the vigilance against the bourgeoisie's struggle for revolutionary leadership, and possesses a "happily ever after" mentality. This "natural theory" on the issue of revolutionary leadership is incorrect. In December 1924, Chen Duxiu also published an article entitled "Lessons Learned from the National Movement in the Past Twenty-seven Years," pointing out that the proletariat is the most uncompromising revolutionary class. It is not only the main force in social revolution but also a "supervisor" in the national revolution.
The articles by Deng Zhongxia, Peng Shuzhi, Chen Duxiu, and others indicate that the Communist Party of China has more people conducting class analysis, and their articles have a common point, which is to clearly state that the leader of the democratic revolution is not the bourgeoisie but the proletariat. This provides a broad ideological basis for the Fourth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to clearly propose the "leadership position of the proletariat." In January 1925, the Fourth National Congress of the Party made a resolution on the "Resolution on the National Revolutionary Movement," clearly stating the key issue of the "leadership position of the proletariat" through the analysis of various classes in society. This clarified the issue of revolutionary leaders that the Second and Third National Congresses of the Party did not explicitly address and corrected the party's mistaken understanding on this issue during the Third National Congress.
In this stage of development, the party, through the analysis of various classes in society, clarified the issue of who is the leader of the revolution. This is another major development of the party based on the clarification of the object and driving force of the revolution, indicating the initial formation of the basic ideology of the party's new democratic revolution. However, at this time, the party did not analyze the peasant issue as the central issue of the revolution.At the same time, there was no correct understanding of the bourgeoisie. In the initial stage, the entire bourgeoisie was believed to be revolutionary, but at this stage, it was believed that the bourgeoisie as a whole cannot lead the revolution. Articles by Deng Zhongxia stated that "the bourgeoisie cannot lead the revolution," and Peng Shuzhi believed that it was difficult for the bourgeoisie to participate in the revolution. The "four major" resolutions believed that the bourgeoisie still could not participate in the revolution. This indicates that the party still does not have a correct understanding of the issue of revolutionary friends.
III. The Party's analysis of the various classes of society entering a mature stage
After the Fourth Party Congress, the revolution developed rapidly, and peasant movements emerged in Hunan and Guangdong, which was inspiring. However, after the death of Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang split, and the rightists began to plot to seize the revolutionary leadership. All of this urgently demanded that the party clarify the situation of its friends, implement the spirit of the Party's Fourth Congress regarding the leadership of the proletarian revolution, and analyze the various classes of society in a relatively complete and scientific manner. From February to June of 925, Qu Qiubai published three articles, "Imperialist Servants and Chinese Civilians," "May Fourth Commemoration and National Revolutionary Movement," and "Imperialist Massacres on May Thirtieth and China's National Revolution," further clarifying the issue of the proletarian leadership position in the democratic revolution and implementing the spirit of the Party's Fourth Congress resolutions. In May 925, Deng Zhongxia published an article titled "Several Important Issues in the Revival Period of the Labor Movement," and in January 1926, he gave a "speech" and a "response" when welcoming the representatives of the Kuomintang at the Second National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In Deng Zhongxia's articles and speeches, while expounding the proletarian leadership position, the issue of "the union of workers and peasants" was raised. He pointed out that peasants are the "natural allies" of workers, and the workers' class's "first" ally in leading the national revolution is the peasantry. It is impossible for the proletariat to achieve the leadership position of the revolution without uniting with the peasants. In December 925, Li Dazhao published an article titled "Land and Peasantry," which analyzed the reasons for the oppression and exploitation of peasants with abundant facts, stating that peasants and workers must unite to overthrow the rule of imperialism and warlord governments.
The articles by Qu Qiubai, Deng Zhongxia, Li Dazhao, and others illustrated that while the party adhered to the ideology of the proletarian leadership position, it gained a preliminary understanding of the basic issue of "peasants being the center of the realization of proletarian revolutionary leadership." This was a new beginning in the party's understanding of the issue of revolutionary friends. In March 1926, Mao Zedong's article "Analysis of the Social Classes in Chinese Society" elevated this understanding to a new level. Its main features are: firstly, it clearly divides the bourgeoisie into comprador bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie, clarifying various vague concepts and viewpoints from the past. The article categorizes the comprador bourgeoisie, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlord class as representatives of imperialism, hindering the development of China's productive forces, and the most reactionary and backward production relations. It clearly establishes the comprador bourgeoisie as an undisputed extremely counter-revolutionary faction. The article also explicitly states that the middle bourgeoisie is the national bourgeoisie. It vividly depicts its economic dependency, weakness, and political vacillation, making it clear that this class is neither entirely revolutionary nor entirely counter-revolutionary. Instead, it is an unreliable friend oscillating between the working masses and imperialism and warlords, necessitating constant vigilance when dealing with them.
Secondly, it analyzes the petite bourgeoisie in an extremely detailed manner. The article points out that the petite bourgeoisie includes self-employed farmers, small business owners, the lower-level knowledge class, and small traders. Moreover, the petite bourgeoisie is divided into three parts, and it provides an extremely profound and vivid analysis of their economic status as "small" and "private," their living conditions, and their political attitudes, stating that "this class, in terms of numbers and its class nature, deserves great attention." This large revolutionary class of small private owners is the proletariat's closest friend and must be united with and led together in the revolution.
Thirdly, it provides an unprecedented scientific analysis of peasants.The article categorizes semiproletariat, poor peasants, small artisans, sales clerks, and street vendors as the semi-proletariat. It provides a deep analysis of the economic status and political attitudes of semiproletariat and poor peasants, stating, "The so-called peasant issue is primarily their issue." This is because poor peasants and semiproletariat are the largest groups in the rural areas, and considering the peasant issue requires addressing their problems first. They are the primary targets of exploitation by the landlord class through feudal rent and usury, thus they are the main force opposing feudal forces in the countryside, and their revolutionary nature surpasses that of self-sufficient peasants. In particular, poor peasants are highly susceptible to revolutionary propaganda, and they constitute the fundamental force to achieve proletarian revolutionary leadership. Mao Zedong's analysis of the semiproletariat and poor peasants indicates that they are the closest friends, effectively pointing out the central focus of the party's consideration of the peasant issue, which is mainly the issue of poor peasants and semiproletariat. Mao Zedong's highly observant and scientifically analytical approach to the peasant issue is a prominent demonstration of his combination of Marxism-Leninism with the practicalities of the Chinese revolution. 
By clarifying the problems of the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, and peasants, the issue of revolutionary friends becomes clear at a glance. This is a new contribution following the clear identification of revolutionary enemies and leaders in the Second and Fourth Congresses of the Party. 
During the period of the Land Revolution War, facing a more complex class struggle situation and circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party, represented by Mao Zedong, further differentiated the social class relations in China. In October 1933, Mao Zedong formulated a relatively scientific classification standard for landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, and workers (including hired laborers) in the document "How to Analyze Rural Classes." After arriving in Shaanxi Province, the Chinese Communist Party summarized the lessons from history and conducted a more systematic analysis of the class relations in Chinese society. In the article "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," Mao Zedong comprehensively analyzed the landlord class, bourgeoisie, various types of petty bourgeoisie and peasant classes outside of the peasant class, the proletariat, and the floating population. These scientific analyses provided a scientific basis for formulating the Party's line, principles, policies, and strategies, elevating the Party's analysis of Chinese social class to a new and scientific level. 
Section 2: The General Line of the New Democratic Revolution
I. The Party's Understanding and Conclusions Regarding the General Line of the New Democratic Revolution
The general line is a concentrated summary of the party's strategic goals, main tasks, and means of achieving these goals and tasks in a certain historical stage. It represents the party's principles and is the basic guiding principle for the party's actions. It encompasses the overall situation and determines the direction, goals, and course of the party's work. Therefore, the general line is the lifeline of the party and plays a significant role in unifying the thinking and actions of the entire party and uniting all the people of all ethnicities in the country. The method by which the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, guides the revolution is to develop the party's general line based on the characteristics of the times and the party's tasks in each stage.
The general line and general policy of the Communist Party of China during the democratic revolution stage are: "A revolution led by the proletariat and supported by the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." This general line has gone through prolonged theoretical exploration and continuous revolutionary practice, and it was only during the period of the resistance against Japan that it was basically formed. It was further supplemented and developed during the period of the liberation war and ultimately formed comprehensively. It should be said that the process of the formation of the Party's general line for the democratic revolution involves the Party's understanding of the three elements of the revolutionary leadership, revolutionary force, and revolutionary object in the general line of the democratic revolution stage. It is the process in which Chinese communists went from little knowledge to a more comprehensive understanding of China's national conditions and Marxist-Leninist theory through theory and practice, as well as the process in which the Chinese democratic revolution experienced twists and turns before achieving national victory.
During the period of the Party's founding and the period of the national revolution, Chinese communists had already conducted preliminary exploration of the fundamental issues of the modern Chinese national democratic revolution and formed the basic ideas of the new democratic revolution. During the period of the land revolution war, the Party continued to explore the fundamental questions of what kind of revolution, and how to carry out the revolution, making significant progress and enriching the theory of the revolutionary path of "surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force" in the new democratic revolution. During the period of the resistance against Japan, based on a systematic summary of the experiences and lessons learned since the founding of the Party, the Party comprehensively summarized and extensively developed the theory of the new democratic revolution. Mao Zedong, in many of his works during this period, profoundly analyzed the international and domestic environment of the Chinese revolution, the nature of Chinese society, and other fundamental issues, and based on this, comprehensively expounded the historical characteristics of the new democratic revolution and the development laws of the Chinese revolution. He put forward a comprehensive set of theories, programs, guidelines, policies, and creatively addressed a series of major questions such as what kind of revolution the Chinese revolution is and how to carry out the revolution.
In "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," Mao Zedong made a comprehensive and profound discussion of the objects, tasks, nature, and prospects of the new democratic revolution from the perspective of theory and practice, explicitly pointing out, "The so-called new democratic revolution is a revolution led by the proletariat and supported by the people, against imperialism and feudalism." This was the initial expression of the general line of the new democratic revolution. After the victory of the resistance against Japan, the main contradiction in the country escalated, and it became an urgent issue for the Party to correctly understand the nature of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and its economic foundation. After a profound analysis of the nature of the regime and its economic foundation, Mao Zedong explicitly referred to the enormous capital developed by the "Four Big Families" represented by Chiang Kai-shek through the power of the state as "bureaucratic capital" and referred to the class that controls the bureaucratic capital as the "bureaucratic bourgeoisie." As bureaucratic capitalism is characterized by mercenarism, feudalism, and monopoly, the "revolutionary task of the new democratic revolution, besides canceling the privileges of imperialism in China, is to eliminate the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie (big bourgeoisie) within the country." In April 1948, Mao Zedong, in his speech at the Jinshui Cadre Conference, even more explicitly listed bureaucratic capitalism along with imperialism and feudalism as the objects of the Chinese revolution, and pointed out, "The new democratic revolution is not any other revolution; it can only be and must be a revolution led by the proletariat and supported by the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." This is the current historical stage's general line and general policy of the Communist Party of China. This general line correctly addresses a series of basic questions related to the leadership, force, object, tasks, nature, and prospects of the new democratic revolution and enriches and develops the theory of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory.
Why does the Communist Party of China lead the people in the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism? What is the fundamental goal of the party-led new democratic revolution? This is another important question that must be answered correctly while addressing what kind of revolution and how it should be carried out. As the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the birth of the Communist Party of China is the requirement of the development of advanced productive forces in China and represents the advanced productive forces on the historical stage. The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China is to change the comprador feudal production relations and the decayed political superstructure, and fundamentally liberate the shackled productive forces. Mao Zedong has made many incisive statements on this matter. In March 1944, when Mao Zedong spoke at the propaganda work conference of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he emphasized to the cadres that they must have a correct understanding of the purpose of the revolution. He pointed out that it is correct for many comrades to put politics and the military in the first place, because without defeating the enemy, nothing else can be achieved. However, it should not be forgotten that the purpose of engaging in politics and the military is to liberate and develop productive forces. Mao Zedong said: the power of politics and the military is for overturning the forces that hinder the development of productive forces; the purpose of overturning the forces that hinder the development of productive forces is to liberate productive forces and develop the economy. The economy is the foundation of politics and the military, and politics and the military are the superstructure. The foundation is the economy, and the fundamental goal is also the development of the economy. The reason why politics and the military are given priority is that without them, productive forces cannot be liberated, so it is impossible to discuss other issues. In this regard, Mao Zedong deeply analyzed the relationship between politics, the military, and the economy, and clarified the fundamental goal of the new democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China. In April 1945, Mao Zedong clearly stated in the political report of the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party of China that the fundamental criterion for judging whether a political party is good or bad is the criterion of productive forces. He pointed out: "The good or bad, the size of the role of all the policies and practices of all political parties in China, ultimately depends on whether they are helpful to the development of the productive forces of the Chinese people, and the degree of help they provide, whether they are hindering the productive forces or liberating the productive forces. To eliminate the Japanese aggressors, carry out land reform, liberate the peasants, develop modern industry, and establish a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous, only all of these can liberate the social productive forces of China and are welcomed by the Chinese people." In December 1947, Mao Zedong made the purpose of the revolution to liberate productive forces more explicit in the article "The Current Situation and Our Tasks". He said that the most fundamental task of the new democratic revolution is to "change the comprador feudal production relations and liberate the shackled productive forces".
In short, during the period of the new democratic revolution, the Communist Party of China's understanding and handling of the relationship between politics, the military, and the economy, the purpose of the revolution, and the criteria for judging the goodness or badness of a political party are correct. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, only by conducting the new democratic revolution first, overthrowing the rule of imperialism and feudalism, can the shackled productive forces be fundamentally liberated and developed. Throughout the entire period of the new democratic revolution, the Communist Party of China embodied and practiced the requirement of developing advanced productive forces with such ideals.
II. The Object of the New Democratic Revolution
The success of the revolution depends on the correctness of the revolutionary line and strategy. The basis of the general line lies in a clear understanding of the national conditions, and the basis of the strategy lies in distinguishing between the enemy and the friend. Distinguishing between the enemy and the friend is the primary issue of the Chinese revolution. Who is the target of the Chinese revolution? This is determined by the nature and characteristics of modern Chinese society and its main social contradictions.Due to the fact that modern China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, the main contradictions in this society were between imperialism and the Chinese nation, and between feudalism and the masses. Therefore, the object of the Chinese revolution was "imperialism and feudalism", in addition to bureaucratic capitalism.
Mao Zedong pointed out: Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? If one cannot distinguish between enemies and friends, they cannot be a revolutionary. It is not easy to distinguish between enemies and friends. Despite thirty years of the Chinese revolution, there were few achievements because the target was not wrong, but the strategy was completely wrong. The so-called wrong strategy refers to the inability to unite genuine friends to attack genuine enemies. The reason why this could not be achieved is the failure to distinguish between who is an enemy and who is a friend. After the Opium War, the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles never ceased. The fundamental reason for the repeated failures of these struggles was the lack of scientific theoretical guidance, the failure to mobilize the masses, especially the working class and peasants, and the failure to recognize the objects and friends of the revolution and formulate the correct strategy.
Although the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had the dual characteristics of anti-feudalism and anti-aggression, it could not be theoretically justified, so it eventually became deeply mired in feudalism. The slogan and actions of the Boxers ("Support the Qing, Destroy the Foreign") indicated that the peasants fundamentally did not understand the relationship between the domestic feudalists and the foreign aggressors. The bourgeois reformists attempted to rely on the feudal emperor to promote modernization and reform, and relied on the support and assistance of British and American imperialism for modernization and reform, which demonstrated a lack of proper understanding of feudalism and Western powers. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing government, but the fruits of the revolution ultimately fell into the hands of Yuan Shikai. The bourgeois revolutionary faction did not have a clear program against imperialism, nor a thorough program against feudalism. They often united warlords to resist warlords, thus failing to clarify the object of struggle for the Chinese people.
After the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the Second National Congress of the CPC clarified the party's minimum program based on the understanding of the current situation in Chinese society. It explicitly stated that the party's minimum program was to oppose imperialism, oppose the rule of feudal warlords, and carry out a democratic revolution, thereby resolving the issue of the object of revolution that had long been unclear. The Second National Congress of the CPC proposed a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program, clearly identifying the object of the revolution. This was a valuable first step for the Communist Party of China in its process of Marxist Sinicization.
Firstly, imperialism is the primary target of the Chinese national democratic revolution in modern times. Why is imperialism the primary target of the Chinese revolution?
Firstly, imperialism directly obstructed China's economic development and political progress. Modern China was subject to aggression from all major and minor imperialist powers in the world. Several powerful countries divided their spheres of influence in China, and some even attempted to monopolize it. China was in a position of being insulted, harmed, and carved up. The purpose of imperialist powers entering China was by no means to transform feudal China into capitalist China, but to make China their colony or semi-colony.Although imperialism has not completely destroyed China, China is still semi-independent, but imperialism is actually the ruler of China.
Secondly, imperialism colludes with feudalism in China, jointly oppressing the Chinese people. When imperialism comes to a backward country, it always supports the backward forces in that country and is unwilling to easily remove or change them, in order to facilitate its aggression and oppression. The first seventy years of modern China were under the rule of the Qing Dynasty, and imperialism turned the Qing Dynasty into a tame tool used by them. After the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, imperialism supported military officials representing the interests of the landlord class and bureaucratic capital. The feudal forces and their superstructure were able to continue to exist because they were maintained by imperialism.
Finally, the Chinese people oppose imperialism in order to eliminate the pillar of the feudal system in China and complete the democratic revolution. In modern China, imperialism and feudalism have a mutually dependent and closely connected relationship. Imperialism uses the feudal forces in China as the basis for its bullying and oppression of China, while the feudal forces rely on imperialism as their backing. Therefore, on the political stage in China, the ones who often perform in front of the curtain are reactionary warlords and politicians, while the imperialist powers manipulate from behind the scenes. In this situation, the Chinese people can only achieve complete liberation from the shackles of feudalism by conducting a national revolution against imperialism and achieve a thorough democratic revolution.
Opposing imperialism and striving for the independence of the Chinese nation is the fundamental prerequisite for solving the problems of "saving the country" and "development" in modern China, and it is also the primary task. It is certainly not an easy task to overcome the imperialist forces that have already dominated China on a very backward social foundation. However, history has proven that only by doing so can China change its tragic fate. In other words, only by first achieving national liberation and independence can discussions of modern political, economic, and cultural development take place.
Opposing imperialism is also a long-term task throughout the entire process of the new democratic revolution. However, due to different situations and main enemies in each stage, the main imperialism being opposed also varies. Moreover, since the forms of imperialist aggression and oppression in different stages are different, the forms in which the Chinese people oppose imperialism are also different. When imperialism launches a war of aggression against China, the Chinese people will oppose imperialism in the form of a national war, such as the resistance against Japan. When imperialism invades China through non-armed means such as politics, economy, and culture, domestic feudal warlords and reactionary politicians often form alliances with imperialism, jointly oppressing the people. In such situations, the Chinese revolution generally adopts the form of a domestic war to oppose imperialism and the alliance of the feudal class. While fighting against the feudal forces, it also indirectly opposes imperialism, such as the National Revolution, the Land Revolution, and the War of Liberation.
Secondly, feudalism is another major target of the modern Chinese national democratic revolution. The reason why feudalism is another major target of the Chinese revolution is that the feudal exploitation system is the main pillar of imperialism's rule in China and the social basis for feudal warlords to implement autocratic rule. Feudal rule is the main obstacle to China's economic modernization and political democratization, and it is the roadblock on the path of the Chinese nation's progress.
In modern China, the landlord class controlled the grassroots political power in the vast rural areas, acting as officials at various levels of government. Many officials, after extorting the people's wealth, went to rural areas to acquire land, becoming emerging landlords. Imperialism established a foothold in China by supporting and cultivating feudal reactionary regimes to obtain maximum benefits, while the feudal reactionary regimes relied on the landlord class to establish their rule over the entire country. Both the Beiyang warlords and the new warlords of the Nationalist Party were like this.
In modern China's economic life, the dominant position was held by the feudal economy. The feudal exploitation system was based on the premise that landlords possessed land and exploited the surplus labor and even necessary labor of the peasants. In old China, the landlords and wealthy farmers, who accounted for less than 10% of the rural population, occupied 70% to 80% of the land, while the poor peasants, hired laborers, middle peasants, and other workers, who accounted for over 90% of the rural population, only owned 20% to 30% of the total land. The feudal landlord class rented land to peasants and collected high rents. This form of rent exploitation not only seized all surplus labor from the peasants but also a significant portion of their necessary labor. In addition to the brutal rent exploitation, peasants were also oppressed by commercial capital and usurious capital, as well as exploited by various reactionary governments at all levels with onerous taxes and levies. This situation resulted in extremely low levels of productivity and extreme poverty for the people in China. Therefore, in order to achieve China's economic modernization and political democratization, it is necessary to oppose feudalism. To fundamentally oppose feudalism means to eliminate the feudal exploitation system, which is characterized by the landlords' ownership of land, and to overthrow the autocracy of the feudal warlords, consolidated representatives of imperialist agents and landlord comprador forces, in order to create conditions for the liberation of productive forces and promote China's economic modernization and political democratization.
Similar to the opposition to imperialism, the opposition to feudalism runs through the entire process of the New Democratic Revolution, but with different specific content and forms at different times. During the period of the Great Revolution, the people opposed the rule of the Beiyang warlords, and the party mobilized the peasants to fight against local tyrants and landlords and redistribute land. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the party raised the banner of land revolution and launched the enthusiastic land revolution war, truly addressing the core and essence of feudalism - the abolition of the feudal landlord class's land ownership. During the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the party, based on changes in the main internal contradictions and the needs of the united front, timely changed the policy of confiscating land from the landlord class to the policy of reducing rent and interest. After the Liberation War, the party implemented a land system that abolished feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, implemented a land system in which farmers have their own land, and ultimately overthrew the superstructure of Chinese feudalism, achieving a decisive victory in the anti-feudal struggle.
In summary, the revolution in modern China had a dual character of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. These two aspects are interrelated. If imperialism's rule is not overturned, the rule of the feudal landlord class cannot be eliminated. Conversely, if the rule of the feudal landlord class is not eradicated and the foundation of imperialism's rule over China is not undermined, it is impossible to mobilize the vast majority of peasants to form a powerful force for the Chinese revolution and overthrow imperialism's rule. Therefore, "national revolution and democratic revolution, these two basic tasks, are mutually distinct but also mutually unified."
Third, bureaucratic capitalism is also the target of China's New Democratic Revolution. In modern times, the development of capitalism in China has shown two distinct but connected parts: bureaucratic capitalism and national capitalism. Correspondingly, the bourgeoisie in modern China is divided into two parts: one is the bureaucratic bourgeoisie (also known as the big bourgeoisie or comprador bourgeoisie), and the other is the national bourgeoisie (also known as the middle bourgeoisie or middle class). Bureaucratic capitalism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie are the targets of the New Democratic Revolution, while national capitalism is always protected during the process, and the national bourgeoisie is one of the driving forces of the New Democratic Revolution. Therefore, the New Democratic Revolution in China is not a general opposition to capitalism and the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it allows and encourages the development of national capitalism, and it only opposes bureaucratic capitalism. The reason why modern Chinese capitalism and bourgeoisie have two distinct components is a result of imperialist aggression against China, and it is a phenomenon unique to the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.
Opposing bureaucratic capitalism does not mean opposing capitalism itself, but because bureaucratic capitalism is a comprador, feudal, and state monopoly capitalism developed by the imperialism in combination with the Chinese feudal landlord class and the old-style rich peasants, relying on state power. This state monopoly capitalism did not develop on the basis of free capitalism, but was caused by the political representatives of the big landlords and the compradors, adopting methods of super-economic plunder, and it has comprador, feudal, and state monopoly characteristics. It was the economic foundation of the reactionary regime led by Chiang Kai-shek and an important factor hindering the development of productive forces in modern China. Therefore, confiscating bureaucratic capital and eliminating the bureaucratic bourgeoisie became one of the fundamental contents of the New Democratic Revolution.
III. Leading forces of the New Democratic Revolution
The core issue of the New Democratic Revolution is the question of proletarian leadership. Whether the revolutionary leadership is in the hands of the bourgeoisie or in the hands of the proletariat is the fundamental sign distinguishing the new democratic revolution from the old democratic revolution, and it is the touchstone to measure the correctness of the party's line. Right opportunism means abandoning leadership, and "left" opportunism means empty-handed leadership. Both right opportunism and "left" opportunism are errors in terms of leadership. Therefore, this issue is very important as it relates to the future of the revolution and determines its success or failure.
In general, the bourgeois democratic revolution should be led by the bourgeoisie who assume the main role and leadership responsibility. However, the Chinese Revolution occurred in a special era and unfolded in a special social and national context, thus raising a new question of who should lead the revolution.
From historical facts, there was a transformation in the leadership of the Chinese Revolution. Since the emergence and development of Chinese national capitalism in the 1870s, representatives of the bourgeoisie did initiate revolutionary movements and indeed led significant struggles like the Xinhai Revolution, which had far-reaching significance.At that time, the proletariat in China was small in number and politically immature, and had not yet formed an independent class force. They only participated in the revolution as followers of the bourgeoisie. This situation changed during the May Fourth Movement. In this movement, the working class showed great political enthusiasm and maturity, played an extremely important role, and began to emerge as an independent class force in Chinese politics. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, the leadership of the Chinese revolution gradually shifted from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat.
From the perspective of ideological understanding, the issue of the leadership of the Chinese revolution also underwent a process of development. In the articles published by Qu Qiubai and Deng Zhongxia between 1923 and 1924, they both emphasized that the proletariat should occupy a leading position in the current national revolution and strive to gain the leadership of the national revolution. The resolution of the Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of China also raised the issue of the leadership of the proletariat in the democratic revolution. However, the practice in the following years showed that the Communist Party of China did not truly resolve the issue of leadership in the revolution. In 1925, Mao Zedong proposed the idea that the proletariat is the leading revolutionary class when analyzing the various classes in Chinese society. During the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927, Mao Zedong's thoughts on the proletariat leading the Chinese revolution became even firmer. In the theory of the New Democratic Revolution formed in the late 1930s, Mao Zedong's theoretical exposition on the leadership of the proletariat in the revolution became an important component.
The bourgeois-democratic revolution in China cannot be led by the bourgeoisie. This is because the changes in the times and the national conditions of China determine that the Chinese bourgeoisie does not possess the ability to lead the bourgeois-democratic revolution. The Chinese bourgeoisie is completely different from the bourgeoisie in the West and lacks a thorough anti-feudal nature. The Chinese bourgeoisie has a dual nature, which means their attitude towards supporting and participating in the revolution is unstable and not resolute. Even during the revolution, they are not willing to completely break away from imperialism, and they have close ties with the exploitation of land rent in the countryside. Therefore, they are unwilling and unable to completely overthrow imperialism, let alone overthrow feudal forces. As a result, the two fundamental questions and tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China cannot be solved by the Chinese national bourgeoisie. This has been proven by the failures of the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Xinhai Revolution. The objective requirements of the Chinese revolution necessitate a new leading class and a new path. The Chinese proletariat is precisely the leading class of the Chinese revolution in response to the requirements of history and the call of the times.
The ability of the Chinese proletariat to shoulder the heavy task of leading the Chinese revolution is mainly determined by its own characteristics. Although the Chinese proletariat is smaller in number compared to the peasantry, younger in age compared to the proletariat in capitalist countries, and lower in cultural level compared to the bourgeoisie, it represents the advanced productive forces of modern China. It is the most progressive, promising, and militant class, possessing the basic advantages of the proletariat, which are closely linked to advanced economic forms, and is rich in organization and discipline.
In addition to the general advantages of the global proletariat, the Chinese proletariat also has many special advantages. First, the Chinese proletariat suffers from multiple oppressions from imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism, and the severity and brutality of this oppression are rare among countries worldwide. Therefore, not only is the entire class the most revolutionary, but also in the revolutionary struggle, they are more resolute and thorough than any other class. Second, although the Chinese working class is not large in number, they are highly concentrated in major cities and large enterprises, making it easier to organize and form a powerful force, and also conducive to the widespread dissemination of Marxism.
Third, the majority of industrial workers in China come from bankrupt peasants, and have a natural connection with the vast majority of peasants, making it easier to form a strong alliance with the peasant class. These special advantages of the Chinese proletariat determine that only it can become the leading class of the revolution. Without the leadership of the proletariat and its Communist Party of China, the Chinese revolution cannot succeed, as proven by the entire history of the Chinese revolution.
Recognizing that the proletariat should lead and is capable of leading the Chinese revolution does not mean that the issue of leadership has been resolved. Leadership will not naturally fall into the hands of the proletariat and must be vigorously fought for. To this end, Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, have gradually developed a set of policies and strategies to strive for and grasp revolutionary leadership through long-term revolutionary practice. The main ones are as follows: First, establishing a wide-ranging revolutionary united front based on the alliance of workers and peasants is the key to achieving the leadership of the proletariat. Mao Zedong once pointed out, "The Chinese proletariat should understand that although they themselves are the most conscious and organized class, they cannot win victory by relying solely on the strength of their own class. To win, they must unite all possible revolutionary classes and strata in various situations and organize a united front of revolution." Without a revolutionary united front, the proletariat cannot actually exercise its leadership. This united front must be based on the alliance of workers and peasants because "the proletariat is the most thoroughgoing revolutionary democrat" and "the peasants are the largest revolutionary democrats". The peasants, who make up about 80% of the total population of the country, are the fundamental force determining the success or failure of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the key to achieving the leadership of the proletariat in the revolutionary revolution lies in uniting the peasantry and forming a strong alliance of workers and peasants.
Secondly, when establishing a united front with the bourgeoisie, the basic strategy to maintain the leadership of the proletariat is to implement the policy of independent and self-reliant struggle as well as unity. Although the bourgeoisie, due to its weakness in economics and politics, cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory, it does not mean that it will automatically give up its leadership. They not only vigorously influence the petite bourgeoisie and peasants but also vigorously influence the proletariat and the Communist Party, seeking to eliminate the independence of the proletariat and the Communist Party in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, and seeking to turn the proletariat and the Communist Party into a tail of the bourgeoisie and its political party, and seeking to make the fruits of the revolution belong to a group and a party of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, when establishing a united front with the bourgeoisie, the proletariat and its political party must maintain a clear mind, adhere to the principle of independent and self-reliant struggle, and implement flexible strategies of both unity and struggle. Only in this way can they not only maintain the united front with the bourgeoisie but also retain the leadership of the proletariat.
Furthermore, establishing a strong revolutionary armed force is the strong pillar that guarantees the leadership of the proletariat. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, where there is no national independence and democratic freedom, the main form of revolutionary struggle is war, and the main form of organization is the army. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Without a strong revolutionary armed force, the proletariat and the Communist Party cannot have a position in China, let alone the so-called leadership of the proletariat. Therefore, in order for the proletariat to maintain its leadership in the democratic revolution, it must establish a powerful revolutionary armed force.
Lastly, strengthening the construction of the proletarian political party is the fundamental guarantee for the realization of the leadership of the proletariat.The leadership of the proletariat in the Chinese revolution is achieved through its own political party, the Communist Party. The leadership of the proletariat is essentially the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party is the initiator and organizer of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The proletariat can only fulfill its historical mission and achieve the cause of human liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party. As the political representative of the proletariat, the Communist Party relies primarily on its correct principles, guidelines, policies, the exemplary role of Communist Party members, the establishment of appropriate relationships with allies, and the development of the "Communist Party's team, ideological unity, and strict discipline" to realize and ensure its political leadership. Therefore, the Communist Party must comprehensively strengthen its own construction in terms of ideology, politics, and organization.
IV. The driving force of the New Democratic Revolution The driving force of the New Democratic Revolution, as stated in the general line of the New Democratic Revolution, is the "masses of the people", mainly including the proletariat, the peasant class, the urban petite bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie.
First, the proletariat is not only the most fundamental driving force of the Chinese revolution but also the leading force of the Chinese revolution. We have made a rather detailed analysis of this issue when discussing the leading forces of the New Democratic Revolution.
Second, the peasant class is the main force of the Chinese revolution and the major part of the "masses of the people". The peasantry accounts for about 80% of the total population in the country, with 4 out of 5 Chinese people being peasants. The so-called "masses of the people" mainly refer to the peasants. The primary content of the democratic revolution is anti-feudalism, and the most fundamental aspect is the eradication of feudal landlord land ownership. The main force against feudalism is the peasants who suffer the heaviest feudal oppression. Therefore, the peasant issue is the basic theme of the Chinese revolution, and the strength of the peasants is the main strength of the Chinese revolution. The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is armed revolutionary action against armed counter-revolution. The peasants constitute the main source of the Chinese armed forces, and the soldiers are essentially peasants putting on military uniforms. Therefore, in 1936, Mao Zedong pointed out incisively during his conversation with Edgar Snow in Yan'an that whoever wins the peasants in China wins the revolution. How to lead the peasant revolution? Mao Zedong pointed out two aspects: first, to liberate the peasants and make land revolution the central content of the democratic revolution, thoroughly eradicating feudal landlord land ownership and implementing the principle of "land to the tiller"; second, to educate the peasants, arm advanced elements among the peasants with Marxist theory, inspire peasant consciousness, and overcome their own weaknesses. The Chinese revolution primarily depends on the strength of these two classes: the workers and the peasants.
The Chinese peasants include the rich peasants, the middle peasants, and the poor peasants. The rich peasants, accounting for about 5% of the rural population, belong to the rural bourgeois class and have a semi-feudal nature. However, they may remain neutral in the land revolution against landlords. The middle peasants, accounting for about 20% of the rural population, are self-sufficient economically and have no political power. They can participate in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles and accept socialism, becoming reliable allies of the proletariat and an important part of the revolutionary force. The poor peasants, including hired laborers, account for about 70% of the rural population. They belong to the semi-proletariat in rural areas and are the broadest and most reliable allies of the proletariat. Although the Chinese peasants are divided into three classes, the main forces of the Chinese revolution are the poor peasants and the middle peasants. The proletariat can only lead the revolution to victory by forming a strong alliance with the poor peasants and middle peasants.
Third, the petite bourgeoisie is one of the basic driving forces of the Chinese revolution.During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, the small bourgeoisie, excluding the peasants, included a large number of intellectuals, small business owners, artisans, and freelancers. Their situation was somewhat similar to that of the middle peasants, as they faced oppression from imperialism, feudalism, and the big bourgeoisie, and were increasingly falling into bankruptcy and decline. Therefore, these small bourgeoisie were one of the driving forces of the Chinese revolution and reliable allies of the proletariat. Among them, intellectuals and young students often played a vanguard and bridging role in the Chinese revolution. In particular, a large number of relatively poor intellectuals were able to participate in and support the revolution alongside workers and peasants. "The widespread dissemination and acceptance of Marxist-Leninist thought in China first took place among intellectuals and young students. The weaving of revolutionary forces and the construction of the revolutionary cause cannot succeed without the participation of revolutionary intellectuals." Some of these individuals are easily influenced by the bourgeoisie and often have a tendency towards subjectivism and individualism, so revolutionary propaganda and organizational work must be carried out among them.
Fourthly, the national bourgeoisie is one of the driving forces of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese national bourgeoisie emerged in the 1870s, later than the Chinese proletariat. They mainly originated from the transformation of landlords, bureaucrats, and merchants who directly invested in modern enterprises, as well as from the transformation of handicraft workshop owners who adopted machine production. Therefore, the Chinese national bourgeoisie can be divided into the upper and lower strata. The upper stratum owns large-scale enterprises and substantial economic power, with close ties to foreign capitalism and domestic feudalism. The contradictions are small, and they often have a dual identity as both officials and merchants. The lower stratum owns enterprises and capital of generally smaller scale, has fewer links with foreign capitalism and domestic feudalism, and faces greater contradictions.
In general, the Chinese national bourgeoisie is a class with dual characteristics, having both revolutionary demands and vacillation. On the one hand, they have experienced oppression from imperialism and the fetters of feudalism, and have contradictions with imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, they have a certain revolutionary nature against feudalism and are one of the forces of revolution. On the other hand, they are weak both economically and politically, and have not completely severed their economic ties with imperialism and feudalism. They lack the courage to thoroughly oppose imperialism and feudalism and are prone to wavering and compromise during the revolution.
The dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is not a weak mentality during the period of their original capital accumulation, nor is it a new problem that arises when the workers and peasants rise up to threaten their interests. It is a "long-standing ailment" that they bring with them from birth. The dual nature of the national bourgeoisie is not intermittent or one-sided for a certain period of time, but inherent and ever-present. When their revolutionary nature is dominant, there is a tendency to compromise with the enemy and a reluctance to adopt a thoroughly anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary program, which initially determines the democratic nature of the Chinese revolution. However, for a long period of time afterward, the understanding of this issue was not profound. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Communist Party of China (CPC) had a confused understanding of the nature of the revolution internally. The 6th National Congress of the CPC made the correct judgement on the nature of the Chinese revolution, but afterwards, "left" opportunism emerged, committing the error of blurring the boundaries between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The Chinese Communist Party truly clarified the nature of the Chinese revolution and provided a scientific interpretation through the combination of theory and practice, as demonstrated in Mao Zedong's works such as "China's Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy".
The issue of the revolutionary future is associated with the nature of the revolution. Generally speaking, the future of the bourgeois democratic revolution is the establishment of a capitalist system under bourgeois dictatorship, but the future of the Chinese revolution is different. The Chinese revolution no longer aims for the development of capitalism as its ultimate goal, but instead intends to follow a new path of new-democratic revolution. Under the leadership of the proletariat, it aims to establish a people's democratic dictatorship and ultimately achieve the goal of socialism through the new-democratic revolution. The issue of the future of the new-democratic revolution is essentially how to handle the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. For this reason, Mao Zedong explicitly put forward the idea of a "two-step" approach to the Chinese revolution. He pointed out that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages: the first stage is to change the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social structure and establish an independent new-democratic country, and the second stage is to advance the revolution and establish a socialist society. In summary, the first step is democracy, and the second step is socialism. "The entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China includes both the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; these are two different revolutionary processes, and only by completing the first process can the second process be achieved."
Strictly distinguishing the nature of the new-democratic revolution from that of the socialist revolution does not mean severing the connection between these two revolutions. The relationship between the two is like the relationship between the first and second parts of an article, where the second part can only be done well if the first part is done well. In general, "the democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. The ultimate goal of all Communists is to strive for the final completion of the socialist society and the communist society." Within the Communist Party of China, there have been two erroneous tendencies regarding the issue of the revolutionary future: one is to separate the two closely linked stages of the Chinese revolutionary process, only seeing their differences without recognizing their connections, and inserting a stage of bourgeois dictatorship and capitalist development between the two stages; the other tendency is to advocate achieving both the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution in one fell swoop, attempting to blur the boundary between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Both of these erroneous tendencies violate the development laws of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, Mao Zedong profoundly summarized that only by recognizing the difference between the new-democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, while also recognizing their connection, can the Chinese revolution be correctly led.
Theory of the Chinese revolutionary path
Section 1 The influence of the "urban center theory" on the Communist Party of China
I. The origins of the "urban center theory"
After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Communist Party of China faced another question in leading the Chinese revolution: How to achieve victory in armed struggle and what path should the revolution take? Establishing armed struggle as the main form of the revolution was a historical progress. However, for a period of time, the party fell into the misconception of the "urban center theory" in its exploration of the Chinese revolutionary path.
In the Soviet Union, the proletariat achieved violent revolution by directly arming the working class and staging uprisings in central cities to seize revolutionary victory.Lenin developed Marxism during the process of leading the Russian Revolution and proposed that the proletariat must seize power with the city as the center. Lenin believed that only the proletariat concentrated in the central city of a capitalist country could completely crush the bourgeoisie. "The city must inevitably lead the countryside. The countryside must inevitably follow the city." Therefore, seizing power in the central city is strategically significant for seizing national power. At the same time, Lenin pointed out that once the proletariat launches an uprising, it must continuously attack bravely and even more bravely. The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism are undoubtedly correct, but each country's revolution has its own characteristics. Therefore, when the Communist International guided the Chinese revolution according to the Soviet model, and the Chinese communists sanctified the instructions of the Communist International, it evolved into a "left" sectarianism that guided the Chinese revolution.
After the October Revolution in Russia, the theory of the city as the center spread to China along with Marxism. The Chinese Communist Party joined the Communist International as a branch in China after the Second Congress of the Party in 1922, and the theoretical and policy guidance of the Communist International had a profound impact on the formulation of the major political principles of the Chinese Communist Party. During the period of the Great Revolution, the Central Committee of the CPC followed the guidance of the Communist International and pursued the "city center" path. At that time, because the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was realized, the revolutionary Kuomintang not only had a unified revolutionary base in Guangdong, but also had a National Revolutionary Army with tens of thousands of soldiers. Moreover, the targeted Northern warlords were divided and had no unified central regime. Therefore, the Northern Expedition led jointly by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, starting from Guangzhou, achieved great victories. This shows that the road aiming to seize the central city in the Northern Expedition was fundamentally correct. This was determined by the special historical conditions at that time. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the political situation in China underwent a drastic change. The former allies turned into fierce enemies, and they established a unified government, possessing a powerful military and occupying the central cities, implementing a bloody policy of massacre against the Communists and revolutionary people. In this situation, it is obvious that the experience of the city center theory from foreign countries is no longer suitable for China's national conditions. Mao Zedong later pointed out, "If the revolutionary forces are unwilling to compromise with imperialism and its lackeys, and insist on fighting resolutely, if the revolutionary forces are to prepare and accumulate their own strength and avoid battles in which victory or defeat is determined against powerful enemies when their strength is insufficient," then they must resolutely change their own approach, that is, leave the central cities and go to the rural areas to establish and consolidate revolutionary bases, "to oppose the vicious enemies who attack the rural areas by utilizing the cities, and gradually win the complete victory of the revolution through long-term struggle." This change in revolutionary policy is not only permissible in Marxism, but also the most essential requirement and manifestation of Marxism. However, at that time, due to the lack of unified understanding of Marxist theory and the Chinese revolutionary practice, the Chinese Communist Party still could not escape the influence of the city center theory and still insisted on the viewpoint of conducting revolutionary struggle with the city as the center. Therefore, the influence of the city center theory became a prominent obstacle encountered by the Chinese Communist Party in the process of exploring new paths for the Chinese revolution during the period of the land revolution war.
II. The Influence of the "City Center Theory" on the Chinese Revolution
The influence of the city center theory on the Chinese Communist Party can be divided into several stages.
The first phase is from the Eighth Plenum of the CPC Central Committee in August 1927 to the Sixth National Congress of the CPC in June 1928. In this phase, the influence of the urban center theory was mainly manifested as follows: in several uprisings led by the CPC Central Committee before and after the Eighth Plenum, attempts were made to advance the revolution by starting riots in cities. For example, in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan, both the central and provincial committees advocated starting riots in Changsha. The Hunan Provincial Committee pointed out in a letter to the central committee, "The Changsha riot is the starting point of the Autumn Harvest Uprising." The central committee also believed that this "is essentially correct." Similarly, in the Guangzhou Uprising, the central committee saw it as "the beginning of the overall uprising in Guangdong and the signal of workers' and peasants' uprisings nationwide." Thus, the idea of using cities as the starting point for riots was fully reflected in the uprisings after the failure of the Great Revolution. Starting from October 1927, the central committees of provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian also proposed to launch guerrilla warfare and land revolution universally, creating a "situation of independent base areas" and "establishing rural revolutionary bases" in their instructions. However, this does not mean that the central committee has abandoned the urban center theory. On the contrary, the central committee still advocates that "the riots in cities should become the center and guide of spontaneous peasant uprisings" under the guidance of this thinking. Under this ideological guidance, the central committee demanded that the overall arrangement of the Hunan uprising should be centered around Changsha. In a letter to the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the central committee pointed out that the Chinese revolution had actually formed a "rural base area," but the development of this kind of base area "must be achieved" in larger cities within each region, and the leadership of the working class must be demonstrated "on top of this." This shows that regardless of the central committee's specific forms of advocating riots or its certain attention to rural base areas, the idea of centering on cities has not changed.
This situation of the central committee is largely influenced by the Communist International. On February 25, 1928, the Ninth Expanded Plenum of the Communist International made a resolution on the Chinese question, emphasizing that the Chinese revolution must continue to follow the "urban center" path and criticizing the CPC Central Committee's leadership of rural guerrilla warfare. This resolution pointed out that rural uprisings must be connected with the climax of the urban revolution before they "can become the starting point of a nationwide uprising." The party's main task is to prepare for the coordinated launch of cities and rural areas in several adjacent provinces and cannot only launch armed uprisings and guerrilla warfare in rural areas without focusing on cities. In this way, guerrilla warfare is bound to fail. It also proposed that "excessive indulgence in guerrilla warfare and indulgence in scattered, unrelated and doomed to fail guerrilla warfare" must be opposed. This clearly follows the model of the Russian Revolution, centering the Chinese revolution on cities without taking into account the actual conditions in China, causing serious consequences for the Chinese revolution.
The second phase is from the Sixth National Congress of the CPC to the Third Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC in September 1930, which is the second phase. In this phase, the CPC Central Committee emphasized placing the focus of work on cities and, under the rule of "left" adventurism, arranged urban uprisings and actions to attack big cities.
At the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in June and July 1928, the Communist International still guided the Chinese Revolution with the theory of urban centers. In the report made by Bukharin, representative of the Comintern, at the beginning of the conference, he did not recognize that the guerrilla warfare led by the Chinese Party was aimed at mobilizing and developing revolutionary forces. Instead, he considered it as an active exploration for seeking a new path for the Chinese revolution starting from the Chinese reality. He criticized the actions of the Chinese Communist Party in initiating armed uprisings among peasants and establishing revolutionary bases in some places, saying that they "valued peasants more than workers." In his concluding remarks, he also opposed the principles of building the Red Army, regarding the Red Army as "non-productive masses" with a single focus on warfare, and he demanded the dispersal of the Red Army to various places for guerrilla operations, playing the role of a peasant self-defense force. After the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the Comintern expressed concerns that the long-term development of the party in rural areas might turn it into a "peasant party." They believed that the work of the party should be centered in cities and focus on the workers' movement in order to embody the leadership of the proletarian party. If the party centered on rural areas and had a large number of peasant members, it would no longer be a proletarian party but instead become a peasant party. In practice, this emphasized the requirement for the Chinese Communist Party to follow the "urban center" path. On October 26, 1929, in the "Letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the issue of the Nationalist Party's reorganization faction and the tasks of the Chinese Communist Party," the Comintern emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party "must exert all efforts to develop political strikes and be prepared for a general political strike." By October 1930, although the Comintern recognized the imbalance between the Chinese workers' movement and the peasant movement, they still emphasized to the Chinese Communist Party that "establishing a soviet government means carrying out armed uprisings in the largest industrial centers." This guided the specific actions of the Chinese Communist Party based on the concrete model of the October Revolution. On April 28, 1928, when discussing the "February Resolution" sent by the Comintern, the majority of members of the Central Political Bureau either intimidated by the criticism from the Comintern or to show loyalty to the international line, spoke in support of the instructions from the Comintern. They believed that since the August 7th Meeting, our party has underestimated the strength of the urban working class, resulting in a relatively passive or abandoned approach to urban work. "This is wrong." They believed that not conducting urban workers' movement would mean "leading with a peasant consciousness" and proposed "opposing peasant consciousness." Based on this discussion, on the 30th, the Central Political Bureau issued the "Notice on the resolution of the Comintern," pointing out that the failure of armed uprisings in rural areas in various regions was "due to the lack of urban leadership and inadequate coordination and contact." Criticizing the Hunan and Hubei Provincial Committees for "only calling for rural uprisings subjectively without considering the cities" and being "indulged" in guerrilla warfare, they demanded that party committees in various regions "resume urban work and establish urban workers' leadership in rural areas," emphasizing that "the city is the leader of the countryside." 
Under the guidance of the above-mentioned spirit, after the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the theory of urban centers continued to have a profound influence on the party: firstly, it emphasized that the work of the party should be centered in cities. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that after the failure of the Great Revolution, many party organizations moved to rural areas, and the peasant consciousness posed a danger of the party departing from the proletariat. In order to ensure the nature of the party and create a proletarian foundation for the party, the Central Committee proposed selecting industrial regions and important cities as "centers of work." Because "the city is the center of all political and economic activities, it can lead the countryside. Once the city is captured, the countryside can quickly rise... The overall spirit of our work must shift from a focus on the countryside to a focus on the city." Even in carrying out rural work, one should also pay special attention to the rural areas near the cities and never focus solely on developing impoverished remote areas. This viewpoint of centering on cities seriously hindered the shift of the party's work focus. 
Secondly, it neglected peasant warfare and Soviet bases. At that time, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that in the new peak of the revolution, peasant warfare was a major branch and a symbol of the most important revolutionary peak, but it was still the revival of the workers' movement.Therefore, in the party's work, we should firmly believe that establishing branches in heavy industries is more valuable than developing hundreds of comrades in a rural area. During the period of Li Lisan's "left" deviationist mistake, this tendency became even more serious. The central government emphasized that the uprising in central cities is of decisive significance and criticized the idea of surrounding cities with rural guerrilla zones as "an illusion" and "an absolutely mistaken concept," and criticized focusing on rural work as "peasant consciousness." Thus, the rural guerrilla thinking that the Communist Party of China had previously agreed to before the Sixth National Congress was criticized as something wrong. This understanding is undoubtedly a regression.
Thirdly, proposing the adventuristic plan of attacking central cities. In early 1930, due to the recovery of revolutionary forces to a certain extent and the warlord melee providing a good opportunity for the development of revolutionary struggle, the central government made a wrong estimation of the situation, believing that the revolutionary situation had matured and was heading towards a climax. In this situation, the central government prepared for one or several provinces to unite first and establish a nationwide revolutionary regime as the overall strategic guideline of the party, emphasizing that the first area to be taken should be a place with "political and economic significance and nationwide leadership," such as Shanghai or Wuhan. Thus, seizing big cities was put forward as the main task. The central government emphasized that seizing big cities must be accompanied by armed workers' uprisings, which were the "most important" condition for the success of an uprising. Therefore, military work should prioritize the discussion of arming workers. The central government required the organization of a general strike or an armed uprising in Shanghai and the organization of soldiers' uprisings in Nanjing to coordinate with the initial victory of Wuhan and its adjacent provinces and regions. At the same time, the central government also assigned the task of attacking big cities to the Red Army, requiring them to "strategically and tactically develop towards central cities on key communication routes." Obviously, at this time, the central committee of the Communist Party of China tried to seize central cities by coordinating urban workers' uprisings and the Red Army's attacks, and achieve the initial victory of one or several provinces with Wuhan as the center.
Fourthly, denying the uneven development of the revolution. At that time, the central government overestimated the development of the revolutionary situation, exaggerated the instability of the enemy's rule, and denied the uneven development of the revolution, believing that the "fundamental crisis of China's economy and politics sharpened equally in any part of the country without any fundamental difference." The most obvious aspect of the revolutionary situation was the balanced development of the red armies of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this situation, "any issue could potentially lead to a revolutionary climax." When the nationwide revolutionary climax arrives, "the beginning of an uprising in one or several provinces is the beginning of a nationwide uprising," and "the initial victory of one or several provinces is the beginning of a nationwide victory." This estimation, in fact, denied the possibility of initial victory in one or several provinces.
It cannot be denied that after the Sixth National Congress, the party central committee also attached importance to developing the Red Army and conducting guerrilla warfare in rural areas. However, the central committee raised this issue from the perspective of winning over the masses and preparing for urban uprisings. The development of the Red Army and rural guerrilla warfare always followed the path of urban uprisings. Due to the pursuit of seizing big cities by adventurist deviationists, the party's work suffered significant damage.Although the Party's focus was on urban areas, the urban work did not achieve the expected results from the central leadership, but instead suffered heavy losses. In just over two months, 11 provincial Party committee offices were destroyed by the enemy, the number of party members in large enterprises was scarce, and the mobility of city branch members reached an unacceptable level. At the same time, the central leadership mobilized the Red Army away from the base areas to attack the central cities, resulting in varying degrees of damage to the Red Army and the base areas. The influence of the urban-centric perspective seriously hindered the development of the rural revolutionary struggle.
The third stage is from the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in September 1930 to the failure of the fifth anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign. During this stage, the urban-centric perspective further harmed the Chinese revolution and declared bankruptcy in practice.
The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put an end to Li Lisan's "left" adventurous mistakes (historically known as the "Li Lisan line"), stopped the uprising and attacks on major cities, but the influence of the urban-centric perspective still remained. After the failure of the Li Lisan line, under the direct guidance of the Communist International, the more "left" dogmatic mistakes of Wang Ming once again dominated the central leadership of the Party. The Wang Ming line reappeared with the adventurous mistake of seizing central cities and mainly demanded the concentration of the Red Army to attack central cities and engage in decisive battles with enemy forces. The urban-centric perspective brought serious losses to the revolution in a new form.
During this period, there were some changes in the revolutionary situation. On the one hand, the Red Army and the base areas experienced significant development in the revolutionary war; on the other hand, the Party's work in the white areas suffered serious setbacks, with party organizations at all levels continuously being destroyed, and struggles such as strikes, flying rallies, and armed uprisings by urban workers mostly failed. This situation necessitated some changes in the guiding ideology of the CPC Central Committee, shifting the focus to attach more importance to the Red Army's war and the rural revolutionary base areas. In the spring of 1933, the Provisional Central Committee relocated from Shanghai to the Central Soviet Area, which objectively can be seen as a progressive change. However, this change was forced and unconscious, and although the Provisional Central Committee moved to the countryside, the urban-centric thinking still persisted.
This was mainly manifested in: First, advocating for the Red Army to seize central cities to achieve the first victory of one province or several provinces. Under the rule of Wang Ming's "left" dogmatic errors, the CPC Central Committee did not understand the long-term and tortuous nature of the Chinese revolution. Although they also criticized Li Lisan's order for the Red Army to attack major cities as a premature and adventurous action, their disagreement with Li Lisan was not about whether or not to occupy central cities to achieve the first victory of one province or several provinces, but about the assessment of the situation, i.e., under what circumstances central cities can be occupied. Therefore, as long as the situation changed, the central leadership would repeat the mistake of attacking major cities. The reality proved this to be true. Soon after the September 18 Incident, the central leadership proposed: "The strategy of not occupying major cities in the past is now different," "Using the current favorable political and military conditions, occupying one or two important central cities to start the first victory of the revolution in one province or several provinces has become a matter that must be addressed in the party's work and Soviet movement agenda."From then on, occupying central cities and achieving the first victory of controlling multiple provinces became the overall plan of the central action. Even during the repeated failures of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign, when the Red Army was in a very passive situation, the central leadership repeatedly emphasized the need to occupy central cities and achieve the first victory of controlling multiple provinces. Under this guideline, the central leadership dismissed the policy of consolidating and developing rural revolutionary base areas that Mao Zedong and others had summarized as "the Soviet theory on the mountains." They criticized Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zetan, Xie Weijun, and Gu Bo's correct view that it is not possible to develop Soviet areas towards central cities and major transportation routes, and advocated for the correct proposition of developing in the vast countryside where the enemy's strength is weak. They condemned it as "pessimistic disappointment" and marginalized Mao Zedong, starting a struggle against Deng, Mao, Xie, and Gu.The method for capturing central cities and achieving the first victory of controlling multiple provinces in this stage is different from the previous two stages. Although the central leadership sometimes mentions urban armed uprisings, the emphasis is mainly on occupying central cities through the military offensives of the Red Army and achieving the first victory of controlling multiple provinces. The main reason for this different approach is that urban work suffered serious losses while the strength of the Red Army gradually grew. In response to the circumstances, the central leadership insisted on the theory of the centrality of cities in a new way.
Secondly, they adopted the route of "active offensive" and the strategic command of regular warfare in the Red Army's war. The "left" leaning central leadership unilaterally interpreted the Marxist principle that continuous offensive should follow armed uprisings and put forward the "key" to all strategic tactics as "under the route of offensive" to destroy the enemy, implementing strategies and tactics such as "offensive on all fronts," "capturing central cities," and "using both fists to fight the enemy." In order to execute the route of active offensive, the central leadership strongly emphasized conducting regular warfare and advocated opposing the strategy of "conservative guerrilla warfare." They demanded the regularity of the Red Army, stating that "the main force of the Red Army must be concentrated, and rapid actions should be taken to the maximum extent possible," making full use of the Red Army's strength for decisive battles. The central leadership denied that the form of the Chinese revolutionary war was a long-term repetition of "encirclement and suppression" and counter-"encirclement and suppression." They believed that the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign was a "class decisive battle" and that crushing the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" would solve the problem of who would win between the Soviet road and the colonial road. Guided by this erroneous thinking, the central leadership commanded the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign according to the principles of so-called regular warfare, opposed "guerrilla-ism," opposed enticing the enemy into deep areas, advocated "keeping the enemy outside the border," and implemented defensive and fortress tactics on the internal lines. As a result, the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign failed directly.
During Wang Ming's rule, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) used incorrect urban perspectives to guide the work of the Red Army and the revolutionary base areas, causing significant losses to the Chinese revolution. The failure of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign proved that, regardless of how it manifested, the theory of the centrality of cities did not conform to the national conditions of China and only caused losses to the Chinese revolution. The failure of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign objectively marked the end of the historical fate of the theory of the centrality of cities in China.
The failure of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign brought a crisis to the Chinese revolution. At this critical juncture, the Central Committee held the Zunyi Conference in January 1935 during the Long March. The conference focused on rectifying the significant military mistakes of that time, summarized the lessons of the failure of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign, and ended Wang Ming's "left" leaning dogmatism in the central leadership. Based on Mao Zedong's speech, the conference adopted the "Summary and Resolution on Opposing the Enemy's Five "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaigns," which pointed out: "China's domestic war is not a short-term war but a long-term and protracted war. The Soviet revolution develops and consolidates itself through continuous smashing of enemy "encirclement and suppression.'" Guided by the principle of protracted warfare, both conservatism and adventurism due to an overestimation of one's victories and an underestimation of the enemy's strength should be opposed.The resolution specifically points out that the adventurism of "unpredictable and unnecessary attacks on central cities at that time" caused serious damage to the Red Army and the revolutionary war. This effectively criticizes the urban-centric view and marks the beginning of the shift in the party's focus.
After the Red First Army arrived in northern Shaanxi during the Long March, although the Central Committee of the Party deployed work for the significant development in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, it was no longer the urban-centered victory for these provinces. The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee believes that "the Chinese Soviet Revolution has achieved initial victories in certain provinces and regions." The view that taking control of central cities and provincial capitals is a prerequisite for a province or multiple provinces to achieve initial victories is "not based on facts." After the Zunyi Conference, Mao Zedong discussed the uneven development of Chinese politics and economy, resulting in imbalanced revolutionary development, as well as the long-term nature of the revolution due to the strength of the enemy and the weakness of the Chinese revolution. He arrived at the conclusion that "revolutionary victories always begin, develop, and prevail in areas where counterrevolutionary forces are relatively weak." In this way, the CPC Central Committee completely replaced and negated the view of achieving initial victories in one province or multiple provinces by centering on cities, with the idea that victories should be achieved first in enemy-controlled weak areas with a focus on rural areas. This marked a significant shift in the issue of the Chinese revolutionary path. It was the result of a group of Chinese Communists, mainly represented by Mao Zedong, who persisted in a long-term rural revolutionary war, constantly summarizing experiences and lessons, and struggling against "leftist" errors.
III. Summary of the Practice Results of the CPC's "Urban-Centric View"
The Communist Party of China is adept at summarizing experiences and lessons from failures and setbacks. The painful practice results of the urban-centric view have made the CPC realize: first, the urban-centric view had a profound impact on the Communist Party of China, and regardless of its form, it could only harm the revolutionary cause. First, it led the CPC Central Committee to adhere to the idea of revolution centered on cities for a long time, starting with cities as the center of rebellion and later as the center of daily work. Even when the central authorities moved to rural areas, it still called for the seizure of central cities and guided the work of the Red Army and base areas with this mindset for an extended period. Secondly, it made the central authorities view armed worker uprisings as the decisive force for determining victory or defeat for a long time, failing to recognize the extreme importance of peasant warfare. Furthermore, it led the central authorities to use the principles of armed uprisings in European proletarian revolutions to command the Red Army's war, failing to understand the laws and characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war. In short, the urban-centric view seriously affected the shift in the focus of the CPC's work and prevented the party from accepting the correct revolutionary path represented by Mao Zedong for a considerable period, resulting in repeated setbacks to the revolutionary cause. Of course, the CPC Central Committee's ideological understanding has also undergone some changes in leading the Chinese revolution. For example, the view of achieving initial victories in one province or multiple provinces played a transitional role in the CPC's departure from the influence of the urban-centric view since it had a Chinese aspect that fit the actual situation of China. Therefore, during a certain period when people did not have a deep understanding of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, they accepted this view. From this perspective, the idea of achieving initial victories in one province or multiple provinces served as a transition while the party rid itself of the influence of the urban-centric view. However, the basis of achieving initial victories in one province or multiple provinces is the provincial capital or central city, which is essentially a product of the urban-centric view. At that time, the CPC Central Committee always failed to understand that capturing the central cities was the task of the final stage of the Chinese democratic revolution, treating it as a prerequisite for achieving initial victories in one province or multiple provinces in the short term. Here, the influence of the urban-centric view prominently demonstrated itself and became an obstacle to the CPC deepening its understanding of the Chinese revolution. The facts have proven that no matter how the urban-centric view appears in China, it can only bring harm to the revolution.
Secondly, the reason why the urban-centric view cannot lead the Chinese revolution to victory is that it is not a product of China's social, political, and economic development and does not conform to China's actual conditions.The theory of urban centrism reflects the laws and characteristics of the proletarian revolution in European capitalist society. However, China's national conditions are different from Europe and have significant specificity. From the perspective of China's social and economic development, China lost the opportunity for independent capitalist development due to imperialism's invasion. China's socio-economic development did not follow the usual laws of capitalist economic development, resulting in a unified market between urban and rural areas and urban control over the countryside. The major cities in China can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of historical cities like Beijing, which were primarily centers of feudal political power and consumption centers rather than production centers. These cities cannot control the rural areas economically. The second category consists of emerging economic and political centers like Shanghai, but the economic lifelines of these cities are controlled by imperialism. This urban economy can only be considered as a semi-colonial economy, incomparable to the economic centers of the West.
Regarding the rural economy, in vast areas of China, feudal production methods still dominate. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that industrial cities have a decisive impact on the vast rural areas. In the process of capitalist development in China, farmers near the trading ports undoubtedly faced the impact of the commodity economy, which accelerated the separation of laborers from means of production. However, this separation process was mainly caused by feudal factors such as feudal land ownership and super-economic forced exploitation, rather than the prosperity of industry and commerce. In the extensive areas far away from trading ports with inconvenient transportation, natural economy still dominates. In China, not only is there an imbalance in economic development between urban and rural areas, but there is also an imbalance in economic development between rural areas. Therefore, Chinese cities and rural areas do not exist under a unified economic form. Cities cannot control the vast countryside, but the countryside can be self-sufficient without relying on cities. Under these conditions, cities can play an important role in revolution but cannot have the absolute authority of European cities.
From the perspective of class forces, the absolute number of the Chinese proletariat is not less than that of the Russian workers during the October Revolution. However, due to China's large population, the relative number of the working class is very small. During the October Revolution, Russian workers accounted for 1/6 of the total population, while Chinese workers at that time accounted for only 1/200 of the total population. Therefore, the main force of the revolution is not the workers but the peasants. The leadership role of the proletariat cannot be reflected in actions such as urban strikes and riots but should be displayed by dispatching their vanguard to the countryside to lead the peasants in land revolution and revolutionary war. Leading the peasants, the proletariat cannot have the same impact as in Europe, where urban workers participate in combat to lead the peasants.From the perspective of China's political situation, for thousands of years, China has been a feudal autocratic centralized state without a democratic tradition. Although there have been some democratic propaganda since the Xinhai Revolution, it has not been deeply rooted due to the short duration, deep-rooted old ideas, and other reasons. After Chiang Kai-shek came to power, he continued the tradition of feudal autocracy and added fascist means. The more central the city, the more severe the reactionary rule and the easier it is to suppress revolutionary activities. In this situation, there is no parliament to exploit, no possibility of public activities in the city, and no accumulated power. Therefore, the Chinese revolution cannot establish a base in the cities and directly seize the highest political power. It can only take the countryside as a revolutionary base, advance from the countryside to the cities, and eventually seize national power.
The above-mentioned social and historical conditions determine that the Chinese revolution cannot follow the path of European revolutions. The theory of urban centrism does not hold in China.
Third, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) gradually liberated itself from the influence of the theory of urban centrism through a tortuous and lengthy process. This shows that correctly integrating Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution is a difficult and complex task. Objectively, China is an extremely complex country. At the turning point after the failure of the Great Revolution, it was impossible for the Party Central Committee to fully understand the national conditions and the laws and characteristics of the revolutionary movement in the country where the revolution was to take place within a short period of time. The influence of the Communist International also added difficulties to the CPC's exploration of the revolutionary path. Subjectively, an important reason is the dogmatic treatment of Marxism and the uncritical application of foreign experiences. Marx, Engels, and Lenin all attached great importance to the leadership role of cities in revolution. In the eyes of Marx and Engels, the leadership role of cities referred to the proletariat's leadership over the peasants. Lenin also said, "The larger the city, the greater the role of the proletariat in the struggle." Of course, Marx, Engels, and Lenin did not overlook the role of peasants, but they discussed the issue from the perspective of winning an alliance with the peasantry and did not explicitly state that the focus of the work of a proletarian party should be on the countryside in terms of the revolutionary path. Chinese Communists, who were based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism but were not adept at integrating these principles with the actual Chinese revolution, naturally took these Marxist-Leninist principles as their guide for action, and thus the cities became the center of their work. This thinking became a fixed and unchangeable orthodox concept for a considerable period of time, while new concepts that emerged from the Chinese context were seen as "heretical anti-Marxist" ideas. At that time, when dogmatism in Marxism was prevalent within the Party and decisions of the Communist International and the experiences of the Soviet Union were treated as sacred, it was not easy to creatively apply the principles of Marxism. This is also a profound lesson left to us when looking back on this period of history.
Section 2: The establishment of the idea of "armed agrarian communist base"
I. Different from the proposed model of the October Revolution in Russia
In the arduous struggle of the entire Party to save the revolution and find a new path for the revolution, a large number of communists, led by Mao Zedong, through the practice of creating and developing the Red Army and rural revolutionary bases, gradually found a path to promote the revival of the Chinese revolution and formed a set of theories to guide the victory of the Chinese revolution. The introduction of the idea of "armed agrarian communist base" marks the beginning of this great theoretical construction.
Although the "urban-centric theory" still holds a dominant position within the Communist Party of China (CPC), the entire party is striving to explore and ponder the issues of future and path in the face of the difficult situation and complex national conditions of the Chinese revolution.
Due to the inconsistent speed and extent of the development of revolutionary struggles in various regions, the CPC Central Committee has come to recognize the imbalance in China's socio-political and economic development, resulting in an imbalance in revolutionary development: firstly, an imbalance in the development of the worker and peasant movements, where rural struggles have developed into guerrilla warfare, some places have established base areas and soviets, while most cities have not reached this level; secondly, an imbalance in revolutionary movement development across regions, where some provinces have developed to the extent of uprising and seizing provincial power, but many provinces have not reached this level. Based on this, at this stage, the CPC Central Committee also put forward some propositions that differ from the model of the October Revolution in Russia.
Firstly, it proposed the strategic goal of "victory in one province leads to victories in several provinces". In the early stage of the land revolution war, the CPC Central Committee mainly deployed armed uprisings in provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. In fact, most of the uprisings led by the party were concentrated in these provinces, and the uprisings in the north did not rise as vigorously as those in the southern provinces. This indicates that the central committee did not adopt the approach of seizing the capital "in one strike" like the French Revolution and the October Revolution in Russia. In November 1927, the central committee explicitly proposed to "unite the forces of the worker and peasant uprisings, gather the spontaneous worker and peasant uprisings from all places, seize political power... until a situation of revolutionary victory in one province or several provinces is created". The central committee believed that in a situation of a general revolutionary upsurge, victory could be achieved first in the regions where the enemy's strength is weak, the worker and peasant revolutionary tide is rising, and the party's leadership strength is the strongest. This first step of victory is the first step towards national victory. By establishing the soviet regime to safeguard this victory, it can then "expand this regime to other regions and the entire population of China, which has 400 million people". The 6th National Congress of the CPC confirmed the strategic goal of striving for victory in one province leading to victories in several provinces, pointing out that under the conditions of a revolutionary upsurge, victory can be achieved first in one province or several provinces.
Secondly, it proposed the idea of rural base areas encircling cities, while simultaneously strengthening urban work, and ultimately achieving victory in one province leading to victories in several provinces through urban uprisings. After the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, in its instructions to various regions, the CPC Central Committee emphasized that "occupying large cities is the final step when the worker and peasant struggle in the vast region reaches a mature stage". Before this, while strengthening the struggle in central cities, it is necessary to create a situation of "base areas" in the countryside, "until the segregation in rural areas is completed and the city struggle reaches its climax, then we can launch a total uprising in the entire region centered around that city to complete the task of seizing this region".
In this way, the revolutionary approach of rural base areas encircling cities, while simultaneously strengthening urban work, and ultimately achieving victory in one province leading to victories in several provinces, replaced the revolutionary approach of starting with urban uprisings and then pushing towards the countryside and seizing the capital in "one strike". It was the first step taken by the CPC Central Committee, to a certain extent, to break free from the constraints of the urban-centric theory and had an important enlightening effect on the party's exploration and eventual acceptance of the path of rural encirclement of cities.
However, at that time, the CPC Central Committee's understanding of the imbalance in China's socio-political and economic development, especially the understanding of the imbalance between urban and rural political and economic development, was not deep, and it was not possible to truly break free from the constraints of the urban-centric theory. At the same time, the goal of achieving victory in one province leading to victories in several provinces did not truly reflect the laws of imbalanced development in the Chinese revolution. The flaws inherent in it could still cause losses to the Chinese revolution under certain conditions.
II. The Initial Form of the "Armed Peasant Base" Idea
In the exploration of the Chinese revolutionary path, the truly significant ideological sprout was the proposal of the "up the mountain" idea within the Chinese Communist Party. The "up the mountain" idea is the initial form of the "armed peasant base" idea.
Before and after the August 7th Meeting, the Central Committee of the CPC had several discussions on the direction of the peasant movement and the armed peasantry. At this time, Mao Zedong proposed the suggestion of "up the mountain." In June 1927, Mao Zedong convened a meeting in Hankou with comrades from Hunan who had fled there after the "May 30th Incident." At this meeting, he called for everyone to return to their hometowns and proposed "up the mountain" in rural areas and "on the boat" on the lakeshore, resolutely fighting against the enemy and armed defense of the revolution. Afterwards, he returned to Hunan as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, overseeing the work of the Hunan Provincial Committee and making arrangements for the self-defense forces of the Farm Association members and peasants to "go up the mountain" and "enter the lake," preserving the revolutionary strength for the right moment. On July 4th, Mao Zedong put forward at an expanded meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee that "peasant armed forces can go up the mountain or join the army connected to our party," clearly stating, "if we do not preserve our forces, we will have no way to handle things when an incident occurs." He believed that the peasant army could go up the mountain and envisioned that "going up the mountain can form the basis of military strength." On the 13th, the Central Committee of the CPC issued a declaration, stating that they were now in a "critical moment for the survival or extinction of the revolution." The Central Committee decided to organize peasant autumn uprisings in four provinces including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to promote the implementation of land revolution. At the end of July, Mao Zedong actively engaged in preparations for the autumn uprising and drafted the "Outline of the Hunan Movement" as a report to the Central Committee. The "Outline" reflected Mao Zedong's thinking of starting with military uprisings, establishing a party-led army, forming armed peasant bases, establishing revolutionary power, and promoting land revolution. On August 7th, the Central Committee of the CPC held a secret meeting in Hankou, and Mao Zedong summarized the four lessons from the failure of the Great Revolution: completely abandoning the independent political position of the Communist Party, neglecting military issues, failing to propose a revolutionary program to address the land issue of the peasants, and the party's detachment from the masses. He emphasized that in the future, great attention must be paid to military affairs and that political power is obtained through the barrel of a gun. At the August 7th Meeting, Mao Zedong was elected as an alternate member of the Central Temporary Political Bureau. Cai Hesen suggested that Mao Zedong stay and work in the Central Committee, while Qu Qiubai wanted him to go to the central office in Shanghai. Mao Zedong disagreed, saying, "I want to go outside and engage in armed uprisings. I don't want to live in high-rise buildings with you all. I want to go up the mountain and make friends with the Greenwoods." On August 9th, Mao Zedong attended a meeting of the Central Temporary Political Bureau. He criticized the incorrect assertion that the Hunan-based army, following the army of the Nanchang Uprising, should go to Guangdong. He believed that "Hunan's popular organization is larger than Guangdong's, what is lacking is armed forces." He explicitly stated, "We must form an armed force of one division in Hunan, occupy five or six counties, establish a political foundation, and develop a land revolution across the whole province." He believed that even if the autumn uprising failed, there would be no need to go to Guangdong, but instead, they should go up the mountain. In mid-August, Mao Zedong was sent by the CPC Central Committee to Hunan as a special envoy to lead the autumn uprising. On August 18th, Mao Zedong made important remarks on the issues of the uprising and land at a provincial committee meeting held in Changsha. He advocated that the development of the autumn uprising in Hunan was about resolving the peasants' land issue.
He pointed out that it is not possible to launch a uprising relying solely on the strength of the peasants, there must be military assistance. The development of the uprising is aimed at seizing political power. In the past, our party made the mistake of neglecting the military. Now we should devote 60% of our efforts to focusing on military activities, implement the seizure of political power through armed struggle, and establish political power. He believes that in order to fully hold the peasants, it is necessary to confiscate the landlords' land and give it to the peasants. On September 9th, Mao Zedong launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan. The apparent characteristics of this uprising are: the participation of numerous armed workers and peasants; openly displaying the banner of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. Initially, the uprising still aimed to seize the central city of Changsha. When the plan of various uprising forces attacking Changsha was thwarted, Mao Zedong showed his ability to promptly summarize experience and lessons from practice, made a prompt decision to change the original deployment, and at the Wenjia Market Conference, decided to "change direction" and lead the uprising forces "up the mountain" to seek a foothold in the enemy-controlled mountainous area. The Autumn Harvest Uprising forces then retreated towards Pingxiang and advanced south along the Luoxiao Mountains. After the "Sanwan Reorganization," by the end of October, Mao Zedong led his forces to reach Ciping of Jinggangshan. After going up the mountain, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong, the forces went deep into mobilizing the masses, assisting in the local recovery, reorganization, and establishment of party organizations, carrying out land revolution, establishing the Red Guard and the revolutionary political power of workers and peasants, widely launching guerrilla warfare, vigorously strengthening the construction of the Red Army, and Jinggangshan became the first rural revolutionary base in the country, igniting the "armed struggle of the workers and peasants". 
However, the revolutionary practice of establishing rural revolutionary bases, represented by Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, was not accepted by the entire party nor by the Comintern at that time. Many people within the Party doubted whether a small or several revolutionary bases could exist in the long term, and dogmatists denounced this great creation as "peasant consciousness". The Comintern believed that "the workers' and peasants' revolution is reaching a new climax", and the policy line of the Communist Party of China was to prepare for a new revolutionary climax, with the main task being "broad mobilization" between cities and countryside and several neighboring provinces and regions. Therefore, it was necessary to oppose the kind of "disorganized, unrelated, and doomed to fail guerrilla warfare." In order to implement the Comintern's instructions on the coordination and adaptation between cities and countryside and adjacent provinces and regions, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically arranged for Hunan Province, using the major road from Pingyue along the border between Hunan and Jiangxi as the main line for the uprising, in order to complete the overall uprising of the entire province. They placed the armed forces of the revolutionary base established by Mao Zedong in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains, under the overall uprising plan of the entire province, and ordered Mao Zedong to lead his forces to attack Xiangnan in order to "expand" the base, and to converge with the southeast of Hunan and the north of Guangdong. At that time, Mao Zedong also believed that the establishment of a base in the countryside was to coordinate with the uprising in the central city. The difference was that he was able to determine the work policy based on the specific circumstances at that time. Mao Zedong had different views on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Hunan Provincial Committee. Mao Zedong believed that during a period of temporary stability under the rule of the ruling class, an approach of dividing forces to expand should not be adopted, only a policy of consolidation could be used. Mao Zedong summarized the experience and lessons of armed uprisings in various places since the "August 7th" meeting, and listed six reasons to explain why the 4th Red Army should not "expand" the base by going to Hunan, but instead should first consolidate the revolutionary base in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains, and to "engage in long-term struggle" with the enemy. Mao Zedong emphasized the significance of consolidating the revolutionary base. He said: "This proposition is definitely not a conservative concept. During the previous nationwide uprisings, various places had a temporary moment of prosperity, but once the enemy launched a counteroffensive, they quickly collapsed. This is because at that time, we did not seek a solid foundation, we only sought grand momentum. At this moment, we must correct this mistake, on one hand, establish a major military base, on the other hand, establish and consolidate the foundation for the uprising in the Hunan and Jiangxi provinces."However, Mao Zedong's correct opinions were not adopted, resulting in the failure of the "August Operation" in Xiangnan. Even after the failure in Xiangnan, the "left" dogmatists, who always claimed to have the correct opinions, continued to criticize Mao Zedong. They said that his views on consolidating the base areas were conservative, and believed that the Red Army could only develop and expand the Soviet areas actively in order to find a way out, and so on.
III. The Introduction and Basic Connotation of the Idea of "Armed Peasant Power Bases"
In contrast to the "left" dogmatists, who were eager to seize power through uprisings in central cities, a pessimistic right-leaning thought emerged within the base areas. Some Communist Party members overestimated the enemy's strength and failed to see the contradictions within the enemy camp. Especially when encountering defeats or being surrounded on all sides, they regarded these local setbacks and difficulties as the overall situation and essence and raised the question of "how long can the Red Flag last." Mao Zedong said that this was a fundamental question, and without answering it, we could not move forward in the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxist violent revolution, summarized the positive and negative experiences of building rural revolutionary base areas in Jinggang Mountains and other places, and wrote articles such as "Why Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" and "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains," proposing the idea of "armed peasant power bases."
First, Mao Zedong discussed the reasons and conditions for the existence and development of red political power. He said, "Within a country, in the midst of the surrounding white political power, the long-term existence of a small or several small areas of red political power is something that has never happened in any country in the world. The occurrence of this peculiar phenomenon has its unique reasons, and its existence and development must also have corresponding conditions."
Firstly, China's political and economic development is imbalanced. China is a large semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with uneven political and economic development. The ruling class mainly concentrates its power in the cities, while the countryside is relatively weaker. As a semi-feudal country, the local self-sufficient agricultural economy gives the Chinese countryside relative independence, with less reliance on the cities. This provides the proletariat with the economic conditions to mobilize the peasants, carry out armed struggle, and establish red political power. As a semi-colonial country, many imperialist powers competed for and divided their spheres of influence in China, which manifested as long-term divisions and wars among warlords. The proletariat can utilize the contradictions, divisions, and wars among warlords to establish and develop revolutionary base areas, enabling the red political power to arise and persist amidst the surrounding white political powers. Mao Zedong pointed out, "We only need to know that the divisions and wars among China's white political powers continue incessantly, then the occurrence, existence, and increasingly development of red political power is undoubtedly true." At the same time, due to China's large size, there is room for revolutionary forces to maneuver; it is conducive to establishing red political power and advantageous for the Red Army's operations. Mao Zedong selected the midpoint of the Luoxiao Mountains to establish the base area because he recognized its favorable geographical position.
Secondly, a solid mass foundation. The first places where the red political regime emerged and could exist for a long time were those places that had been influenced by the first domestic revolutionary war and had experienced a surge in revolutionary mass movements. These areas, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and others, were the main regions affected by the Northern Expedition War, had Party organizations, and the Party had a significant influence among the masses. They had organized trade unions and farm associations, and the working-class and peasant masses had fought against the comprador and landlord classes. In such places, both the people and the army had received political training in the democratic revolution, which made it easier for the red political regime to emerge and persist.
Thirdly, a progressive revolutionary situation. Whether a small local people's regime can exist for a long time depends on whether the national revolutionary situation is progressing. Mao Zedong believed that if the national revolutionary situation was progressing, then the development and long-term existence of small red political regimes would be unquestionable. Otherwise, it would be impossible. So, is the Chinese revolutionary situation developing or not? Mao Zedong believed that after the failure of the Great Revolution, none of the fundamental contradictions that sparked the Chinese Revolution were resolved. Therefore, "the current Chinese revolutionary situation follows the continued division and war between the domestic comprador and landlord class and the international bourgeoisie, and continues to progress." Therefore, the red regions will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national power.
Fourthly, the presence of a considerable force of the regular Red Army. Mao Zedong believed that the presence of a considerable force of the regular Red Army was a necessary condition for the existence of red political regimes. If there is only the Red Guards and no regular Red Army, it cannot deal with reactionary armed forces, and it cannot create a base for a separatist situation. Even if a separatist situation is formed, it cannot be long-term and increasingly developed. He emphasized: "The idea of 'armed peasant power' is an important idea that the Communist Party and the peasant masses in separatist areas must fully possess."
Fifthly, the correct leadership of the Communist Party. "Armed peasant power" is a separatist movement led by the Communist Party of China. The correct leadership of the Communist Party is a crucial factor in the existence and development of the red political regime. The Xiang-Gan Border Special Committee, under the leadership of Mao Zedong as secretary, and the Military Commission, under the leadership of Chen Yi as secretary, implemented correct border policies, fought resolutely against the enemy, and created a political regime in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains. They opposed escapism, engaged in land revolution in the separatist regions, helped the development of local Party organizations through the army, and helped the development of armed forces in the local areas through the army. They took a defensive stance in Hunan, where the ruling forces were relatively strong, and an offensive stance in Jiangxi, where the ruling forces were relatively weak. They put great efforts into building up the base in Yongxin, creating a separatist movement among the masses, and organizing long-term struggle. They concentrated the Red Army's strength to confront the current enemy, opposed splitting the forces, and avoided being defeated by the enemy. Their policy for expanding the separatist regions followed a wave-like approach, opposing impulsive actions. Only through these measures did they achieve various military victories from April to July in the Jinggang Mountains. On the other hand, the command of the "Left" opportunist faction led to the "August failure" in Southern Hunan.
The above five conditions, the first condition is the most important. It is precisely because of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of China's society that determines the imbalance in China's political and economic development and provides the possibility for the establishment of a red regime. Mao Zedong correctly analyzed the reasons for the existence and development of the red regime based on the characteristics of China's social nature.
Secondly, Mao Zedong put forward the basic content of "armed segregation of the workers and peasants". What is meant by "armed segregation of the workers and peasants"? It means under the leadership of the proletariat, armed struggle is the main form, revolutionary base areas are the main support, and land revolution is the main content for the construction of rural revolutionary base areas or the establishment of a red regime.
Armed struggle is the main form of "armed segregation of the workers and peasants". Mao Zedong pointed out profoundly that China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, with no democratic system internally and oppressed by feudal system; externally, it lacks national independence and is oppressed by imperialism. The enemies of the Chinese people - warlords, gentry, and imperialism - all hold knives and want to kill people. In the face of such enemies, the main form of Chinese revolution must be armed. The revolution in China, with agriculture as its main economy, develops through military uprisings, which is a characteristic. Because, in the encirclement of the four white regimes, without armed forces and without armed struggle, this situation of segregation cannot be sustained even for a day. Mao Zedong emphasized that the struggle on the border is entirely a military struggle, and the party and the masses have no choice but to militarize together. How to deal with the enemy, how to fight? These become the central issues of daily life. The so-called segregation must be armed. If there is no armed force in a place, or if the armed force is insufficient, or if the strategy against the enemy is wrong, that place will be immediately occupied by the enemy. Without armed struggle, there is no existence of revolutionary base areas, no position of the people, and there is no room for the development of the party's various works. Only by deeply mobilizing the peasant masses and extensively carrying out armed struggle can the progress of the peasant land revolution be ensured, the areas of segregation be expanded, and the rural revolutionary base areas be constructed and developed.
Land revolution is the central content of "armed segregation of the workers and peasants". In order to carry out the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, it is necessary to mobilize the peasants to deeply carry out land revolution, because the exploitation and oppression of the Chinese people by imperialism basically rely on the backward feudal relations in the countryside. Destroying the feudal system is a fatal blow to the imperialist rule in China. When Mao Zedong attended the Hunan Provincial Committee meeting in Changsha to discuss the plan for the Autumn Harvest Uprising, he clearly stated that the purpose of the uprising was to thoroughly implement land revolution and use armed struggle to solve the land problem for the peasants. After the establishment of the "armed peasant-worker power in the Jinggang Mountains," land revolution became a major task in the areas under their control. When Mao Zedong first arrived at the Jinggang Mountains, his main responsibilities were to lead the Red Army, mobilize the peasants, fight against local tyrants, distribute their wealth, cancel debts, and prepare for land redistribution. On May 20, 1928, when Mao Zedong chaired the first representative conference of the Party in the Xianggan border area, he proposed the task of intensifying the land revolution. After the conference, under the leadership of the Xianggan Border Area Special Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Border Area Government of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Land Revolution Committees were established at the county, district, and township levels, and policies were formulated to distribute land on a per capita basis at the village level. As a result, land revolution in the Jinggang Mountains revolutionary base area began to unfold vigorously. The land revolution liberated rural productivity, greatly stimulated the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the peasants, not only providing a source of replenishment for the Red Army but also creating material conditions to support the Red Army's war, further consolidating and developing the "armed peasant-worker power in the Xianggan border area."
Rural revolutionary base areas are the basic strongholds of the "armed peasant-worker power" and the starting point and foothold for the development and victory of the revolution. The fundamental issue of the revolution is a question of state power. Based on China's national conditions, the Party shifted its focus from the cities to the countryside, establishing revolutionary base areas in rural areas to gather and develop strength. The question of opening up and establishing rural revolutionary base areas is essentially a question of seizing state power. First seize the countryside, then occupy the cities; first seize partial power, then seize state power nationwide. The establishment of this kind of partial power, led by the proletariat and peasants, in the form of "armed peasant-worker power," is the starting point for promoting a nationwide revolutionary upsurge and achieving victory in the national revolution. Mao Zedong attached great importance to the construction of revolutionary base areas, believing that the consolidation and development of this red political power was not only beneficial to the development of land revolution and armed struggle but also the cultivation of talents for our Party. Mao Zedong specifically opposed the "mobile guerrilla" tactics that advocated not establishing revolutionary base areas. When criticizing Lin Biao's erroneous viewpoints in a letter, he pointed out that it seemed as if doing the difficult work of establishing state power in a period far from the revolutionary peak was in vain, and they hoped to expand political influence through lighter and more mobile guerrilla warfare. They planned to wait until the work of mobilizing the masses across the country was done, or until a certain stage was reached, before launching a nationwide armed uprising. This kind of theory about first mobilizing the masses and then establishing state power, nationwide and covering all regions, is not suitable for the reality of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong said that the correct approach is to adopt the methods employed by Zhu De and Mao Zedong, by Fang Zhimin, to establish base areas with roots, plan the construction of state power, deeply carry out land revolution, and expand the arming of the people. The development of state power expands in a wave-like manner, and so on. These policies are undoubtedly correct.
In conclusion, the "armed peasant-worker power" ideology expounded by Mao Zedong calls for the proletariat to lead armed struggle as the main form, with land revolution as the fundamental content, and revolutionary base areas as strategic strongholds. This serves as the starting point to achieve the fundamental goal of seizing state power nationwide. Armed struggle, land revolution, and the construction of base areas guided by the ideology of "armed peasant-worker power" are organically linked and interconnected.Without armed struggle under the leadership of the proletariat, effective land revolution cannot be carried out, and revolutionary base areas cannot be established and developed. Without land revolution, it is impossible to fully mobilize the vast majority of peasants, and armed struggle cannot gain the support of millions of people. As a result, the base areas cannot be consolidated and developed. Without revolutionary base areas, armed struggle will lose its foundation and fall into failure, and the achievements of land revolution cannot be maintained. The concept of "armed control by workers and peasants" integrates these three inseparable aspects. It not only includes the basic content of the Chinese democratic revolution, but also reflects the main form and fundamental purpose of the Chinese democratic revolution. After the failure of the Great Revolution, it provided extremely correct revolutionary thinking to guide the further development of the Chinese revolution.
Mao Zedong's discussion on the conditions for the existence of the red political power, the proposal of the concept of "armed control by workers and peasants," and the specific elaboration of the control policy have important theoretical and practical significance. Mao Zedong scientifically answered the question "how long can the red flag keep flying?" raised within the base areas. He summarized the main way and approach of the Party leading the revolutionary struggle, accumulating and developing revolutionary forces - relying on the power of workers and peasants (mainly peasants), establishing and developing rural revolutionary base areas through armed struggle, concisely summarizing it as a formula. This not only summarized the results of the Party's exploration of the revolutionary path in the previous stage but also laid the foundation for the complete formation of the theory of "encircling the cities from the countryside" in the future. The specific policy provisions also provided a reference for the development and consolidation of other revolutionary base areas. In April 1929, Mao Zedong drafted a plan for the Central Committee in a letter to the front committee of the Red Fourth Army, proposing a plan to win over the entire Jiangxi through four-way control. The deployment was as follows: under the situation where revolutionary forces in Ganbei, Ganxi, Gannan, and Gandong had "formed a situation of surrounding Nanchang to the south," "decided that, in the early stage of the Kuomintang's infighting, a large area consisting of more than 20 counties in western Fujian and southern Jiangxi, using guerrilla tactics to mobilize the masses, openly control areas with the masses, deeply carry out land revolution, establish a workers' and peasants' regime, thereby connecting this control with the control in the Hunan-Jiangxi border area, forming a strong force as the foundation for advancement." Then, strive to win over the entire Jiangxi, as well as western Fujian and western Zhejiang, within one year. In September, the first representative assembly of the Communist Party in western Fujian formulated a plan regarding the "future of armed control by workers and peasants" in western Fujian, with a focus on "the ways in which the Party, political power, and the masses should develop." It emphasized the following three points: first, "establishing a central working area" to serve as a base for the development of the whole of western Fujian; second, eliminating gaps between red areas and "connecting them to each other"; third, "developing forward like waves relying on areas where work has already been done, without rashly moving forward without relevance." The above two documents specifically planned how to implement the "armed control by workers and peasants" in a region and a province. The principles proposing the establishment of a solid "central region" as a base for continued advancement, the gradual advancement of the development of the base areas relying on the existing regions, the gradual connection of adjacent control areas, and the provisions regarding the content of struggle within the control areas are all summarized from practical experience, enriching the ideas of "armed control by workers and peasants."
Section 3: The Idea of "Encircling the Cities from the Countryside"
I. The Beginning Formation of the Theory of the Road of Encircling the Cities from the Countryside
Armed control by workers and peasants is an important part of the road of encircling the cities from the countryside, but its implementation does not mean that the complete formation of the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from the countryside has been achieved. This is because there are two unresolved issues: first, where should the party's main focus be placed? Should it focus on urban struggle to promote a nationwide revolutionary upsurge and seize state power nationwide? Or should it focus on armed control by workers and peasants in rural areas and follow the road of encircling the cities from the countryside? Second, how should the role of rural base areas in seizing state power nationwide be evaluated? Is it the decisive factor or merely an auxiliary factor? Without solving these two issues, it is impossible to persistently and comprehensively develop the new path.
The development of the revolutionary situation has continuously deepened the understanding of the Chinese Communist Party, represented by Mao Zedong, regarding the path of the Chinese revolution. The 6th Party Congress affirmed Mao Zedong's practice of establishing base areas. Subsequently, in September 1929, Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Central Committee, issued the Instructional Letter to the Preparatory Committee of the Red Fourth Army (hereinafter referred to as the "September Instructional Letter"). It affirmed Mao Zedong's ideas of "armed agrarian enclaves" and pointed out that "the Red Army must precede the urban political power; this is a characteristic of the Chinese revolution and is a product of the Chinese economic foundation." The letter supported Mao Zedong's strategies regarding Red Army actions and the strengthening of Red Army construction. It aimed to rectify non-proletarian ideologies within the Party and advocated for the establishment of a strong people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party. Based on the spirit of the Central Committee's "September Instructional Letter," the Red Fourth Army held the Gutian Conference in Shanghang, Fujian in December 1929, which provided clear directions for the construction of the army and the Party. During the process of transferring to the base areas in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, the situations and experiences of other rural base areas (such as the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Revolutionary Base led by Fang Zhimin and the Hunan-Hubei-Western Jiangxi Revolutionary Base led by He Long) were continuously communicated to the Red Fourth Army. These experiences broadened Mao Zedong's horizons and resulted in a new leap in understanding the path of the Chinese revolution, further strengthening the viewpoint that the Chinese revolution must follow the path of encircling the cities from the countryside.
However, at that time, there was a tendency within the Party to dogmatize Marxism-Leninism and idolize instructions from the Communist International. There was a lack of understanding of the path of the Chinese revolution of encircling the cities from the countryside. Moreover, at a certain point, there existed a relatively pessimistic mood regarding the revolutionary situation among some leaders of the Communist International and the Central Committee, as reflected in the February Letter from the Central Committee. They believed that the revolutionary climax would not arrive and proposed dividing the Red Army into small groups and dispersing them into the countryside, with Zhu Mao (Zhu De and Mao Zedong) leaving the army and concealing the larger goal. This pessimistic thinking also influenced the Red Fourth Army. Lin Biao, commander of the army at the time, was one representative of this sentiment, which was evident during the Ruijin Conference on May 18, 1929. Lin Biao believed that the revolutionary situation was "not optimistic" and that the future appeared "very bleak." He thought that the arduous work of establishing red political power and deeply engaging in land revolution in the countryside was "futile." Lin Biao proposed to replace the establishment of revolutionary base areas with the strategy of "mobile guerrilla warfare" to influence the masses, and when the masses were mobilized to a certain extent, a nationwide armed uprising could be launched, leading to revolutionary victory. This indicates that there was still a lack of correct understanding within the Party and the army regarding the development situation of the Chinese revolution and the path to victory. In order to answer this question, Mao Zedong wrote a lengthy letter to Lin Biao in January 1930, which became the article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire." It systematically expounds on the strategic significance of establishing rural base areas for the Chinese revolution. The main content and significance of this article are as follows: it clearly states that, considering China's national circumstances, the path of a nationwide armed uprising with cities as the center is not suitable. China must follow its own path. Mao Zedong began the article by stating, "Some comrades in our party lack a correct understanding of the situation and the accompanying questions of our actions." They do not believe in the possibility of a rapid arrival of the revolutionary climax and lack a deep understanding of establishing red political power in guerrilla regions to promote the arrival of a nationwide revolutionary climax. "They seem to think that doing the arduous work of establishing political power in a time that is still far from the revolutionary climax is futile. They hope to expand their political influence through more lightweight mobile guerrilla warfare, and when the work of winning the masses throughout the country has been accomplished or has reached a certain stage, launch a nationwide armed uprising at that time, incorporating the strength of the Red Army to create a nationwide revolution. This theory of a nationwide revolution, including all areas and initially winning over the masses before establishing political power, is not suitable for the actual situation of the Chinese revolution."
"Mao Zedong analyzed the source of this theory, mainly due to the failure to recognize China's national conditions and the failure to approach issues from the perspective of China's national conditions. He further argued for the necessity of establishing and developing revolutionary base areas and red political power, and put forward the idea of rural-centered thinking. Mao Zedong analyzed that China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country where multiple imperialist powers are competing for influence, which has resulted in long-term internal conflicts among the ruling classes in China. This enables the possibility of establishing revolutionary base areas in the vast countryside, allowing the Red Army and revolutionary political power to exist and develop in rural areas in the long term. Mao Zedong emphasized the necessity and significance of constructing political power with a solid base, conducting in-depth land revolution, and expanding the armed forces of the workers and peasants. He pointed out that this form of armed struggle by the workers and peasants is the highest form of class struggle in semi-colonial China under the leadership of the proletariat, and it is the inevitable result of the development of class struggle by the semi-colonial peasants. It is undoubtedly the most important factor in advancing the revolutionary climax nationwide. Only by doing so can the faith of the revolutionary masses be established, just like the Soviet Union did for the whole world. Only by doing so can the ruling class be confronted with great difficulties and its foundations be shaken, thus promoting its internal disintegration. And only by doing so can a genuine Red Army be created, becoming the main tool for the future great revolution. In short, only by doing so can the revolutionary climax be promoted." This is because the peasants account for more than 80% of the country's population and are the main force of the Chinese revolution. In order for the Chinese proletariat to accomplish the task of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and to address the central issue of democratic revolution - the land problem of the peasants, it is necessary to rely on and organize the peasants, and raise the peasants' struggle to the highest form of armed seizure of political power. The revolutionary war led by the Chinese proletariat is essentially a war with the peasants as the main force. Mao Zedong's proposition of "the most important factor" and the four "only by doing so" have made the relationship between the armed struggle of workers and peasants and the achievement of national revolutionary victory very clear. As Zhou Enlai said in his article "On the Study of the 'Six Bigs'", Mao Zedong's thinking actually advocated placing the emphasis on the countryside and demanded that the party shift its focus from the cities to the countryside, making it the new starting point for the great revolution.The analysis also covers a series of contradictions in China at that time, showing that the trend of the Chinese revolution, described as "a spark can start a prairie fire," is inevitable.
Mao Zedong pointed out that in judging the political situation in China, one must analyze it from a comprehensive, interconnected, and developmental perspective, grasp the essence of things, and not be misled by appearances. He specifically analyzed the subjective forces and counter-revolutionary forces of the Chinese revolution, pointing out that although the subjective forces of the Chinese revolution were weak at the present time, the counter-revolutionary forces rooted in China's backward and fragile socio-economic structure were also relatively weak. Therefore, the Chinese revolution would certainly reach its peak faster than Western Europe. Moreover, when we look at things, we must look at their essence. As long as we carefully examine the various contradictions that have led to the climax of the Chinese revolution, we will understand that the arrival of the climax is unquestionable and not be misled by surface phenomena. Mao Zedong specifically analyzed that after the failure of the 1927 revolution, none of the contradictions between the people and imperialism and feudalism were resolved, and the contradictions among the ruling classes were also irreconcilable. The broad masses of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and young students all sought revolution, including soldiers in the reactionary army of the Kuomintang. China was filled with dry kindling nationwide, and it would soon ignite into a blazing fire. The trend of "a spark can start a prairie fire" is unstoppable. "The time from 'a spark' to 'blazing fire' is undoubtedly not far off." Mao Zedong criticized the pessimistic thinking of the Red Army and the party, including the letter from the Central Committee in February, because they failed to grasp the essence of the current situation. At the same time, he pointed out that Marxists are not fortune tellers, and they should only be able to indicate the general direction of future development and changes, and it is neither possible nor advisable to mechanically specify the timing.But the climax of the Chinese revolution is indeed like standing at the top of a mountain, looking into the distance, the east is already shining with bright rays of the rising sun.
It is not difficult to see that Mao Zedong's understanding of the characteristics of Chinese society, the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and its laws in "A single spark can start a prairie fire" has made a new leap. He not only further answered the possibility of the existence and development of the red political power in China, but also further revealed the necessity of the existence and development of the red political power in China. He proposed from both positive and negative aspects that when the Chinese revolution is defeated by powerful enemies in the cities and cannot win the national revolution with the city as the center, the focus of the party's work must be on the countryside rather than the cities. This marks the beginning of Mao Zedong's theory of the countryside surrounding the cities.
Second, the comprehensive analysis of the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities. In May 1930, Mao Zedong wrote an article titled "Oppose Dogmatism", which further provided a Marxist response to the debate within the party at that time about the path of the Chinese revolution from the perspective of the party's ideological line. It exposed and criticized the mistake of the "leftist" doctrinaires who dogmatized and sanctified the path of the October Revolution in Russia and opposed the path of the countryside surrounding the cities. It also clearly put forward the theoretical basis for the path of the countryside surrounding the cities. The article pointed out that "the victory of the Chinese revolutionary struggle depends on the comrades' understanding of the Chinese situation" and "without investigation, there is no right to speak." It criticized the bad style of theoretical detachment from reality and "blindly talking."
After initially establishing the focus of the party's work on the countryside, establishing revolutionary bases in rural areas, and carrying out land revolution and other aspects of the countryside surrounding the cities, Mao Zedong further summarized the experiences in party building, state building, and military building. He put forward a series of new guiding policies, forming the main contents of the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities. In January 1935, the Zunyi Conference affirmed Mao Zedong's correct leadership and opened up a new situation for the Chinese revolution. In December 1936, Mao Zedong wrote "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War", providing a comprehensive discourse on the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war and other issues, elucidating the law of uneven development in China's political and economic development, drawing the conclusion that the Chinese revolutionary war has the potential for development and victory, and determining the entire set of military strategic tactics for the countryside surrounding the cities, including active defense, preparation for anti-"encirclement and suppression", strategic retreat, strategic counterattack, concentration of forces, mobile warfare, rapid decision-making warfare, annihilating warfare, etc. In the book, Mao Zedong expounded the objective conditions and subjective conditions for the existence and development of rural revolutionary bases in China from a new perspective: "China is a large country - 'The East is not shining but the West is, if it's dark in the South, there is still the North', there is no need to worry about having no room to maneuver", which is an important geographical condition; through the implementation of land revolution and equality between officers and soldiers, it is possible to obtain support from the peasants and the red army, which is an important mass foundation; the Communist Party adopts the correct strategic tactics, which is the fundamental guarantee for exerting subjective initiative and achieving revolutionary victory. These discussions by Mao Zedong are also important content of the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities. In July 1937, Mao Zedong wrote "On Practice", and completed "On Contradiction" in August, which from the perspective of epistemology explained the relationship between theory and practice, as well as the correct methods of analyzing and solving problems. It profoundly exposed the ideological roots of doctrinism and the serious harm it caused to the revolutionary cause, laying a philosophical foundation for the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities. At this point, Mao Zedong's systematic and complete expounding of the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities signifies the complete formation of the theory of the countryside surrounding the cities.
After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, during the period of the War of Resistance against Japan and the Liberation War, Mao Zedong's theory of the countryside surrounding the cities has made great progress. In response to the new situation of the Anti-Japanese War, in late August 1937, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China correctly formulated the principles of independent mountain guerrilla warfare at the Luochuan Conference. It decided to vigorously organize guerrilla warfare in the enemy-occupied areas, mobilize the masses, and establish rural anti-Japanese base areas. Led by Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee, based on the actual situation of the Anti-Japanese War, resisted Wang Ming's demand to shift the party's focus back to the cities, as well as rightist errors, and consciously placed the party's focus on the vast countryside. In May 1938, Mao Zedong emphasized the issue of establishing base areas for guerrilla warfare in his article "Strategic Issues of Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan". When arguing for the necessity and importance of establishing base areas for guerrilla warfare, he pointed out that due to the long and brutal nature of the Anti-Japanese War, guerrilla warfare in enemy-occupied areas cannot be sustained without base areas. The base area of guerrilla warfare is a strategic base for the guerrilla forces to carry out their strategic tasks, achieve self-preservation and development, and eliminate and expel the enemy. Without this strategic base, the execution of all strategic tasks and the realization of the war objectives will lose their foundation. Therefore, overcoming the banditry mentality thoroughly in the minds of the leaders of guerrilla warfare is a prerequisite for establishing base areas. He also proposed that temporary or relatively stable base areas should be established in the weakly controlled mountainous, flat, and riverside areas. From a local perspective, each isolated base area is surrounded by the enemy on all sides, but when these base areas are connected, the major cities held by the enemy are surrounded by our base areas on all sides.
In the same year, Mao Zedong specifically analyzed the three-in-one conditions in China in his article "The New Stage". The first condition is that the semi-colonial cities cannot completely dominate the countryside; the second is that China is a large country with a vast territory for guerrilla activities; the third is that there are People's army and people's masses led by the Communist Party. Utilizing these three conditions, we can organize and persist in a long-term and extensive war to oppose the enemy's occupation of the cities, surround the cities with a dogged war, isolate the cities, gradually grow our own strength from the long-term war, change the balance of power between us and the enemy, and coordinate with changes in the world to expel the enemy and restore the cities. Mao Zedong also pointed out that due to these three conditions, the countryside can definitely triumph over the cities.
China's armed struggle must follow the path of encircling the cities from the countryside, which is a characteristic of the Chinese revolution determined by its economic foundation. China's economic foundation is different from that of capitalist countries. The economic foundation of capitalist countries is dominated by capitalist production methods, with the center of economic foundation in the cities; China's economic foundation is primarily based on backward feudal production methods dispersed in the countryside, while the relatively advanced modernized cities have long been occupied by powerful imperialism and domestic reactionaries, becoming the center of enemy rule. After the failure of the Great Revolution, due to the even more brutal rule of the new warlords of the Kuomintang, the revolutionary forces in the cities suffered serious devastation repeatedly. Therefore, the weak revolutionary forces in the cities cannot engage in armed uprisings or decisive battles against the enemy who has absolute superiority. In capitalist countries, the main target of the proletarian revolution is the bourgeoisie concentrated in the cities, and the main driving force of the revolution is the working class concentrated in the cities; while in China, one of the main targets is the feudal landlord class dispersed in the countryside, and the main driving force of the revolution is the rural peasant class dispersed in the countryside under the leadership of the working class. This determines that in China, the revolution must first have a rural Red Army, and then have urban political power. Therefore, Mao Zedong made a more explicit summary of the problem of the Chinese revolutionary path in his article "War and Strategy Issues" in November 1938. He pointed out that the proletarian parties in capitalist countries can win the masses through long-term legal struggles, and when it comes to uprisings and wars, they first occupy large cities and then attack the countryside. China is different.
China's characteristics are: it is not an independent democratic country, but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country; internally, there is no democratic system, but oppressive feudalism; externally, there is no national independence, but imperialism oppression. Therefore, there is no parliament to use and no legal right for organized workers to go on strike. Here, the task of the Communist Party is not primarily to enter into uprising and war through long-term legal struggle, nor to first occupy cities and then take the countryside, but to take the opposite path. In December 1939, Mao Zedong further explained the problem of the path of the Chinese revolution in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party". He pointed out that the revolutionary forces in China must prepare themselves, accumulate and strengthen their own strength, and avoid battles where the enemy is stronger when their own strength is insufficient. "To do this, it is necessary to transform backward rural areas into advanced and solid bases, to create great revolutionary positions in terms of military, politics, economy, and culture, in order to oppose the vicious enemy that attacks rural areas from cities, and to gradually achieve complete victory in the revolution through long-term struggles." At the same time, he also pointed out, "Due to the uneven development of China's economy (which is not a unified capitalist economy), the vastness of China's land (which provides room for the revolutionary forces to maneuver), the internal disunity and various contradictions within China's counter-revolutionary forces, and the fact that the struggle of the peasants, who are the main force of the Chinese revolution, is under the leadership of the proletarian party, the Communist Party, all this makes it possible for the Chinese revolution to achieve initial victory in rural areas, but it also creates an unbalanced state of revolution and brings long-term and arduous tasks to the cause of achieving complete revolutionary victory. Hence, it can be understood that the long-term revolutionary struggle carried out in these revolutionary bases is primarily a guerrilla warfare under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, ignoring the viewpoint of rural bases for the revolution, neglecting the arduous work among peasants, neglecting the viewpoint of guerrilla warfare, are all incorrect." However, focusing on the work in rural bases does not mean giving up on urban work and work in other vast rural areas under enemy rule. On the contrary, without urban work and other rural work, rural bases will be isolated, and the revolution will fail. Moreover, the ultimate goal of the revolution is to seize the cities, which serve as the main enemy bases. Without sufficient urban work, this goal cannot be achieved. These statements have enriched Mao Zedong's theory of surrounding the cities from the countryside. The path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle, created by the Chinese Communists led by Mao Zedong, had already spread to many regions nationwide during the period of the resistance against Japan and became the only correct path leading to the final victory of the anti-Japanese war. The theory of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle has been comprehensively expounded, and its main content is as follows: First, China's national conditions determine that the Chinese revolution must take the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle.
Mao Zedong pointed out that the central task and the highest form of the revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to resolve the problems through war. This revolutionary principle of Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable. In capitalist countries, there is no feudal system internally but a democratic system of the bourgeoisie, and there is no national oppression externally but the oppression of one's own nation over other nations. Based on these characteristics, the task of the proletarian party in capitalist countries is to educate workers through long-term legal struggles, to cultivate their strength, and to prepare for the final overthrow of capitalism. However, China is not an independent democratic country, but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country; internally, there is no democratic system, but imperialist oppression. There is no parliament to use, and there is no legal right for organized workers to go on strike.Therefore, in China, the main form of struggle is warfare, and the main organizational form is the military. The task of the Communist Party is not primarily through long-term legal struggle to enter uprising and war, nor is it to occupy cities first and then take the countryside. Instead, it takes the opposite path, which is to focus on the countryside, to accumulate and develop strength in the vast rural areas where enemy rule is weak, and to prepare to seize power through armed struggle in the end.
Secondly, to take the path of surrounding cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle, it is necessary to establish a strong rural base. Mao Zedong pointed out that if the revolutionary forces are unwilling to compromise with imperialism and its lackeys and want to continue to fight hard, if the revolutionary forces are to prepare to accumulate and train their own strength and avoid decisive battles with powerful enemies when their own strength is insufficient, then they must transform the backward countryside into advanced and consolidated bases. They must create great revolutionary strongholds militarily, politically, economically, and culturally in order to oppose the fierce enemies who use cities to attack the rural areas and to gradually win the complete victory of the revolution through long-term struggle.
Thirdly, it is important to handle the relationship between rural and urban struggles correctly. Mao Zedong pointed out that focusing on the countryside does not mean neglecting urban struggles, nor does it mean abandoning other forms of struggle besides armed struggle. Without the coordination of various forms of struggle other than armed struggle, armed struggle alone cannot achieve victory. Similarly, without urban work and other work, the rural base will be isolated and the revolution will fail. The relationship between rural and urban struggles is that the countryside is the main force and the city is in a supporting role, with urban struggles supporting rural struggles. The party's urban struggles should focus on defense and make full use of legal means to organize the masses and carry out struggles. The guiding principle for the party's work in areas controlled by the Kuomintang is to "conceal the elite, remain hidden for a long time, accumulate strength, and wait for the opportune moment."
In the later stage of the Liberation War, the People's Liberation War entered the strategic decisive battle phase. Following Mao Zedong's thinking of surrounding cities from the countryside and finally seizing the cities, the Chinese People's Liberation Army gradually accomplished the task of surrounding cities from the countryside and seizing cities block by block and slice by slice throughout the country. In practice, following Mao Zedong's thinking, small cities occupied by the enemy were primarily targeted first, followed by medium-sized cities, and finally large cities. During the process of seizing cities, the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army created two different approaches in Tianjin and Beijing: armed seizure and peaceful liberation. Mao Zedong's great strategic thinking and revolutionary practice during the Liberation War further enriched and developed the thinking of surrounding cities from the countryside and finally seizing them.
Chinese communists, represented by Mao Zedong, started from the reality of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, sought truth from facts, broke through the constraints of dogmatism, and creatively formed a relatively complete theoretical framework of surrounding cities from the countryside, establishing a red regime, founding a party and an army in rural areas, carrying out land revolution, and the strategic tactics that should be adopted. This revealed the objective laws of the development of the Chinese revolution, opened up a new path of seizing power through armed struggle, ensured the victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, and achieved a historical leap in combining Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution during the period of the Chinese democratic revolution. The road of surrounding cities from the countryside and seizing power nationwide in China is a path that has never been mentioned in the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and others. It is also a brand-new path in the history of proletarian revolution.It is a glorious example of combining the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism on proletarian violence revolution, state power, the alliance between workers and peasants, and the uneven development of political and economic aspects of imperialist countries with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. It is another great achievement in the proletarian revolution movement following the October Revolution in Russia. The theory of surrounding cities with rural areas and armed seizure of state power in China occupies an extremely important position in the development history of Mao Zedong Thought.
Section 4: Thoughts on the Construction of Revolutionary Base Areas
I. Thoughts on the Construction of Revolutionary Base Areas in the Initial StageAfter the failure of the 1927 Revolution, the focus of the Chinese Communist Party's work shifted from the cities to the countryside, and they began to establish base areas through armed struggles. Communists led by Mao Zedong opened the first revolutionary base area in Jinggangshan and conducted arduous practice and theoretical analysis in the construction of base areas, putting forward a series of original insights in terms of political power, economic development, and cultural construction, forming a relatively correct theory of base area construction.
Thoughts on Political Power Construction
After the Autumn Harvest Uprising forces arrived in the Jinggangshan area, they began to work on political power construction. On November 28, 1927, the Chaling County Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Government was established, with Tan Zhenlin as the chairman. In January 1928, the Suichuan County Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Government was established. In February, the Ninggang County Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Government was established. Subsequently, the Yongxin and Lianhua County Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Governments were also established. People's power was also established in the districts and townships of each county. In May, the Xianggan Soviet Government of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers was established based on the various county-level Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Governments. On November 25, Mao Zedong summarized the experience of one year's political power construction, and wrote a report to the Communist Party Central Committee titled "Struggle in Jinggangshan", elaborating on the following basic ideas.
(1) Implement the system of People's Congress.
Mao Zedong pointed out: The people's power at all levels in counties, districts, and townships has been generally organized, but in name only. Many places lack representatives' meetings for workers, peasants, and soldiers. The executive committees of the government in townships, districts, and even counties are all elected through mass meetings. Mass meetings held without discussion on issues cannot provide political training for the masses and are easily manipulated by opportunist elements. In some places, although representative meetings have been held, once elections are over, power is concentrated in the executive committees and the representative meetings are not discussed any further. Mao Zedong noted that the reason for this is the lack of promotion and education on the new political system of representative meetings. The feudal legacy of autocracy and dictatorship has been deeply ingrained in the minds of the masses, even among ordinary party members, and it cannot be eradicated all at once. When faced with convenience, people tend to favor an undemanding democratic system.For this reason, Mao Zedong proposed that democracy must be implemented, and a detailed organizational law for representative assemblies at all levels must be formulated. This was Mao Zedong's earliest idea of implementing the system of the People's Congress.
(2) It is necessary to adhere to the principle of democratic centralism.
Mao Zedong pointed out that the proletarian dictatorship of the working class and peasants is "the power of the masses themselves, relying directly on the masses, and its strength depends entirely on the masses." At that time, the system of democratic centralism was not only applied in the People's Congress, but also in the executive committees, that is, "it was not used to in the government work." Mao Zedong emphasized, "The system of democratic centralism must demonstrate its effectiveness in revolutionary struggles, make the masses understand that it is the most effective in mobilizing the strength of the masses and conducive to the struggle, in order to universally and truly apply mass organizations." He summarized the experience of implementing democratic centralism in revolutionary base areas over the past few years, especially the experience of fully developing people's democracy, and affirmed the effective methods of developing people's democracy in base areas for many years. He emphasized the importance of adhering to the principle of democratic centralism in the construction of base area political power.
(3) It is necessary to implement the principle of separating the Party and the government.
In the construction of political power in the Jinggang Mountains area, the Communist Party of China had higher prestige compared to the government, and the functions of the government were not well fulfilled, resulting in the phenomenon of party substituting for government. At the same time, there were no Communist Party organizations in some local government agencies. In order to overcome these two phenomena, Mao Zedong pointed out, "In the future, the Party must perform the task of leading the government; the Party's propositions and methods must be passed through the organization of the government when implemented, except for propaganda." In November 1931, the First National Congress of Soviets of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of China was held in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The Temporary Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China, a proletarian dictatorship of workers and peasants, was established, and the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee with Mao Zedong as chairman were elected. The first constitution in the history of revolutionary base areas, the Outline of the Constitution of the Soviet Republic of China, was passed. The constitution stipulated that "all political power of the Soviets belongs to the workers, peasants, Red Army soldiers, and all laboring people," and it also stipulated the non-recognition of any political and economic privileges of imperialism in China, and the abolition of all unequal treaties. All properties of imperialism in China were "nationalized," etc. The highest authority of the Soviet political power was the National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and during the period when the congress was closed, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Republic was the highest political authority. Under the Central Executive Committee, there was the organization of People's Committee to handle daily political affairs. In January 1934, the Second National Congress of Soviets of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of China was held in Duanjin. Mao Zedong made the report of the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee to the Second National Congress of Soviets of China, and delivered the concluding speeches on "Caring for the People's Livelihood and Paying Attention to Work Methods." The Outline of the Constitution of the Soviet Republic of China was passed, and the Executive Committee of the Soviet Government of China was re-elected. Mao Zedong continued to serve as chairman. During his tenure in leading the government work, Mao Zedong emphasized the following ideas for the construction of political power:
First, the idea of combining democracy and dictatorship.Mao Zedong pointed out that the most extensive democracy of the Soviet Union is first manifested in its elections. The Soviets grant full voting rights and the right to be elected to all nations that were previously exploited and oppressed, ensuring gender equality between men and women. Secondly, Soviet democracy is evident in the representative assemblies of cities and townships. The system of representative assemblies is the basis of the Soviet Union and serves as a mechanism for the Soviets to be closely connected to the masses. Furthermore, Soviet democracy can be seen in granting revolutionary people complete freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, and strike, as well as attracting the supervision and criticism of the masses towards their work. Mao Zedong specifically emphasized the role of the People's Congress, allowing the people to fully exercise their right to be the masters of their own affairs. He believed that, overall, the Soviet Union possessed a very broad revolutionary democracy for the masses, but at the same time, within this democracy, it constituted the majority of its power, built upon the belief and conscious needs of millions of workers and peasants. With this power, the Soviets formed their own dictatorship, organized revolutionary wars, established Soviet courts, and launched fierce attacks on class enemies, while the Soviet courts played a significant role in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities within Soviet territory.
Secondly, Mao Zedong emphasized the idea of caring for the masses' lives. He pointed out that our current central task is to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the revolutionary struggle, to overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang through revolutionary war, to develop the revolution nationwide, and to drive imperialism out of China. Therefore, we must obtain the support and endorsement of the masses. He said: Do we want to gain the support of the masses? Do we want the masses to put forth their full effort to the front lines? Then, we must be with the masses, mobilize their enthusiasm, care for their concerns, and sincerely seek their interests, resolving their production and livelihood problems: the problems of salt, rice, housing, clothing, and childbirth. If we do this, the broad masses will undoubtedly support us, treating the revolution as their life and the supreme banner of honor. Mao Zedong also stated: What is the real copper wall and iron barrier? It is the masses, millions of people who genuinely support the revolution. This real copper wall and iron barrier cannot be broken by any force, absolutely invincible. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we must break the counter-revolutionaries. Mao Zedong confidently said: If we unite millions of masses around the revolutionary government, develop our revolutionary war, we can eliminate all counter-revolutionaries and achieve victory throughout China.
Thirdly, Mao Zedong emphasized the idea of working methods. He pointed out that we are the leaders and organizers of the revolutionary war, as well as the leaders and organizers of the masses' lives. Therefore, the issue of working methods is of great importance. He stated, "We must not only propose tasks but also solve the problem of how to accomplish them. Without solving the problem of methods, the tasks are just empty words. Without paying attention to expanding the leadership of the Red Army, without considering the methods to expand the Red Army, no matter how many times we talk about it, it will not be successful". Mao Zedong also proposed the method of advanced individuals leading and carrying along those who are less advanced. He said, "In all the places we lead, there is undoubtedly a number of active cadres, outstanding comrades who emerge from the masses and work well.".These comrades have a responsibility to help weaker areas and help those comrades who are not good at work to do well. "We must use practical methods to improve our work. Advanced areas should advance even further, and backward areas should catch up with advanced areas." Only in this way can we crush the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" and overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang nationwide. Regarding the ideology of economic construction
Economic construction is the main work of building revolutionary base areas. Mao Zedong, based on the actual production situation, production level, and economic structure of the rural revolutionary base areas, and considering the needs of the revolutionary war, summarized the valuable thoughts on the economic construction of the revolutionary base areas while conducting political power construction. In October 1928, the Second Conference of the Communist Party of China in the border between Hunan and Jiangxi passed a resolution drafted by Mao Zedong. The first part of the resolution is "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?" It puts forward the idea that the experience of the revolutionary base areas in the encirclement of white forces "worth every party member's attention." At that time, the lack of daily necessities and cash in the revolutionary base areas became a major problem. He emphasized: "If the border region's party cannot have an appropriate way to solve the economic problem, under the condition of the enemy's stable power for a relatively long period, the base will encounter great difficulties. The relatively resolution of this economic problem is really worth every party member's attention." Mao Zedong, during his work leading the Temporary Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led the economic construction of the central base areas, summarized the experience of economic construction work, and published important works such as "We Must Pay Attention to Economic Work" and "Our Economic Policy", expounding the ideas on economic construction of the revolutionary base areas.
First, it expounds the importance of economic construction in the revolutionary base areas and criticizes erroneous views on economic construction. Mao Zedong pointed out, "The fierce development of the revolutionary war requires us to mobilize the masses, immediately launch movements on the economic front, and carry out all necessary and possible economic construction projects. Why? Now all our work should be for the victory of the revolutionary war, first to completely defeat the enemy's fifth 'encirclement and suppression' war; to ensure the supply and provisions of the Red Army by striving for material conditions; to improve the people's livelihood, thereby further stimulating the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the revolutionary war; to organize and educate the masses on the economic front, so as to provide new mass power for the war; to consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants, consolidate proletarian democratic dictatorship, and strengthen the leadership of the proletariat. For all this, it is necessary to carry out economic construction." Therefore, Mao Zedong criticized two erroneous views on economic construction: one view is "the opinion that economic construction should not be carried out in the environment of the revolutionary war is extremely wrong." He pointed out that they do not understand that without economic construction, the material conditions of the revolutionary war cannot be guaranteed, and the people will feel tired in the long-term war, the economic blockade imposed by the enemy on our base areas cannot be broken, and the people's living conditions cannot be improved. In this way, the revolutionary war cannot proceed smoothly, and the alliance between workers and peasants will be affected. Another view is "the belief that economic construction is already the center of all current tasks, and ignoring the revolutionary war and conducting economic construction separate from it is also wrong." Mao Zedong pointed out, "In the current stage, economic construction must revolve around the central task that is the revolutionary war. The revolutionary war is the current central task, and economic construction is for it, revolves around it, and is subordinate to it." "Only after the end of the domestic war can we say and should say that economic construction is the center of all tasks." Mao Zedong clearly explained the dialectical relationship between economic construction and the revolutionary war here.
Secondly, the correct principles for the economic policies in the revolutionary base areas were established. After 1931, the labor and tax policies implemented by the "left" adventurists, represented by Wang Ming, caused great damage to the industrial and commercial sectors in the rural revolutionary base areas and posed serious difficulties for military and civilian supplies. This raised doubts and dissatisfaction among many party members. In 1933, Zhang Wentian, Chen Yun, and others published articles criticizing this "left" mistake. They pointed out that the policy of "eating up the capital and then figuring things out" would inevitably lead to the withering of the Soviet economy, unemployment among workers, and a deterioration in their living conditions. This policy actually represented the petty-bourgeois consciousness of a backward section of workers and the narrow trade unionist interests of a certain group of workers. In January 1934, Mao Zedong, in his report to the Second National Congress of Workers and Peasants, further pointed out: "Currently, our state-owned economy consists of three aspects: state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and private enterprises." "Regarding private economy, as long as it does not go beyond the framework of government laws, we not only do not hinder it, but also promote and incentivize it. Because the development of private economy is what the interests of the country and the people require. Needless to say, at present, private economy has an absolute advantage and will inevitably be dominant for a considerable period of time." "Efforts should be made to develop state-owned economy as much as possible and develop cooperative economy on a large scale, in coordination with the promotion of private economy. Through long-term efforts, cooperative economy and state-owned economy will become tremendous forces in the economic field." "The principle of our economic policy is to carry out all possible and necessary economic construction, concentrate economic forces to support the war, while striving to improve the people's living conditions, consolidate the unity of the workers and peasants in the economic field, ensure the leadership of the proletariat over the peasants, and strive for the leadership of state-owned economy over private economy, which will create the prerequisites for future development towards socialism." It can be said that Mao Zedong has put forward the idea of the three important components (state-owned economy, cooperative economy, and private economy) and their interrelationships in the New Democratic economic system. These economic policy ideas have been guiding the economic construction of the subsequent base areas.
Thirdly, he elucidated the center of the economic construction in the revolutionary base areas and the position of agricultural production. China is one of the earliest countries with developed civilization and has the most developed rural natural economy. During China's over two thousand years of feudal society, the dominant economic form has always been the natural economy combining agriculture and household handicrafts. Its production is not for exchange, but for the needs of the producers or production units themselves. This economic form has continued to exist until modern China. Therefore, Mao Zedong pointed out: "The center of our economic construction is to develop agricultural production, develop industrial production, develop foreign trade, and develop cooperatives." He particularly emphasized: "Under current conditions, agricultural production takes the first place in our economic work..."Because China has always relied on agriculture since ancient times. Based in rural areas, our main focus is agricultural production, which not only solves the most important food problems we need to address, but also supplies raw materials such as hemp, cotton, sugar, and bamboo for the development of industrial and handicraft production, including clothing, sugar, and paper. Therefore, it is necessary to make efforts to lead farmers in seeking solutions to labor, livestock, fertilizer, seed, and water problems. He pointed out that mobilizing women to participate in production, organizing labor mutual aid, and organizing oxen cooperatives are important measures to solve the above problems. Especially, the idea that water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture is put forward.
Fourthly, it indicates the basic policy direction of the fiscal policy of the revolutionary base areas. The purpose of Soviet finance is to guarantee the supply and provision of the revolutionary war, and to ensure the expenditure of all revolutionary costs of the Soviet, but at that time, the Soviet Republic was still a relatively small part in the country, and it was also economically backward in some places. Moreover, it implemented a tax policy that is convenient for the masses and based its fiscal policy on the principles of class and revolution. Therefore, the fiscal resources of the Soviet are: ① Confiscation and collection from all feudal exploiters; ② Taxes; ③ Development of national economic undertakings. Mao Zedong pointed out that "increasing our fiscal revenue through the development of the national economy is the basic policy of our fiscal policy." We must make fiscal work serve the development of production, so "the issuance of paper money by the state bank should be mainly based on the needs of the development of the national economy, and the needs of pure finance can only be placed in a secondary position." At the same time, it is pointed out that "the expenditure of the fiscal should be based on the principle of thrift." "To save every dime for the war and the revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system." It should be made clear to every government worker that "corruption and waste are serious crimes." Therefore, the struggle against corruption and waste must be carried out.
Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's economic construction ideas, the economic construction work of various revolutionary base areas made great contributions to the revolutionary war and improved the lives of the people in the revolutionary base areas because the Soviet government has done a lot of difficult work and vigorously developed production. About the ideology of cultural construction.
China is a country with a very backward culture. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, illiteracy accounted for 80% of the national population, resulting in the ignorance of the people. Mao Zedong pointed out: In order to achieve victory in the revolutionary war, consolidate and develop the Soviet regime, mobilize all forces of the people to join the great revolutionary struggle, and create a new era of revolution, the Soviet must implement reforms in cultural education, remove the shackles imposed by the ruling reactionary class on the spiritual life of the working masses, and create a new Soviet culture for the working masses. After the establishment of the revolutionary base areas, cultural construction received great attention. Elementary schools were widely established in the revolutionary base areas, allowing the children of the working masses to attend school and study. At the same time, literacy campaigns were carried out, various forms of night schools and study classes were organized, and literacy movements were launched. The government also developed publishing industry, published various newspapers and books, and mass revolutionary literature and art also developed. Sports and health work also achieved great results. Mao Zedong summarized the experience of cultural education work in the revolutionary base areas and put forward two basic contents of the ideology of cultural education construction: Firstly, he proposed the guideline for cultural education. Mao Zedong pointed out that our guideline for cultural education is "to educate the vast laboring masses with the spirit of communism, to make cultural education serve the revolutionary war and class struggle, to link education with labor, and to make the vast Chinese people become people who enjoy civilization and happiness." Secondly, he proposed the central task of cultural education construction."
Mao Zedong pointed out that the central task of cultural and educational development in revolutionary base areas is to implement compulsory education for all, promote widespread social education, strive to eliminate illiteracy, and cultivate a large number of high-level cadres for leading the revolutionary struggle. Regarding existing intellectuals, they should be encouraged to serve the people and contribute to the development of cultural and educational programs in order to foster revolutionary intellectuals.
II. The development and maturity of ideological construction in the party's base areas.
After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Army led by the Communist Party of China advanced into enemy-controlled areas, launched independent and guerrilla warfare against the Japanese, and mobilized the masses to establish anti-Japanese base areas. With the development of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, the democratic base areas against Japan became increasingly consolidated and expanded. The anti-Japanese democratic base areas were advanced strongholds for implementing and realizing the Communist Party of China's theory of new democracy. The unified front government led by the Communist Party of China established in each base area, and the implementation of various policies of new democracy fully demonstrated that the nature of the base areas had begun to change from semi-colonial and semi-feudal society to a nascent form of new democratic society. The people in the base areas truly enjoyed a brand-new life of being the masters of the land. With the encouragement of the Communist Party of China, the people united under its leadership, fought to overcome the Japanese invaders, and strived to achieve a better future. The ideological construction of the party's base areas also achieved comprehensive and full development.In the construction work of the anti-Japanese democratic base areas, the construction of political power was the central link. The basic guiding ideology for the construction of political power in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas was the "Ten-Point Program for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country" formulated by the Communist Party of China in the early stage of the anti-Japanese war, as well as the political program of the new democratic revolution expounded by Mao Zedong in his "On New Democracy". Its specific content is as follows: 
Firstly, in the construction of political power, the principle of the "three-thirds system" has been widely implemented and executed. The political power in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas is a political power of national united front. In the construction of political power, the Party earnestly implemented the principle of the "three-thirds system", which is a practice and system for the implementation of political democracy by the Party. On March 6, 1940, in the Communist Party of China Central Committee's directive on the issue of political power in the anti-Japanese base areas, it was clearly stipulated that in various anti-Japanese base areas, the ratio of Communist Party members, left-wing non-party progressives, and non-left, non-right centrists in various levels of public opinion or political power organs should be one-third each. On March 11, at the senior cadres' meeting in Yan'an, Mao Zedong reiterated that the personnel allocation in political power should be: "one-third for Communist Party members, representing the proletarians and poor peasants; one-third for left-wing progressives, representing the petite bourgeoisie; and one-third for centrists and other individuals, representing the middle bourgeoisie and enlightened gentlemen. Only collaborators and anti-Communists are not qualified to participate in this kind of political power". On December 25, 1940, in the directive issued by Mao Zedong to the Party, the term "three-thirds system" was formally mentioned for the first time. On May 1, 1941, the Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region proposed in the "Program of Governance in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" approved by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee that "Communist Party members should account for only one-third of the candidate list, so that parties, factions, and non-party individuals can participate in the activities of public opinion organs and the management of the border region's administration." On November 21, 1941, in Mao Zedong's speech at the Consultative Council of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he once again explained the importance of implementing the "three-thirds system" to both the Party members and the public, and educated the Party members that "national affairs are the affairs of the country, not the affairs of a single party. Therefore, Communist Party members have the obligation to cooperate with non-Party members and not the right to exclude others and monopolize everything." He also solemnly declared to non-Party members, "The principle of democratic cooperation between the Communist Party and non-Party members is fixed, unchanging, and will never change." He hoped that this kind of cooperation "can be well implemented in this meeting." The principle of the "three-thirds system" in the construction of political power is an effective democratic system explored by the Party in the construction of the anti-Japanese base areas. Deng Xiaoping pointed out in an article published in the Communist Party of China North Bureau's publication "Party Life" on April 15, 1941, that the essence of the "three-thirds system" of political power is a democratic issue.Implement this extensive democratic system firmly. On the one hand, it is necessary for various social classes to unite against common enemies. On the other hand, it allows different classes to represent significant forces and constrain each other. Without a united government that gives all parties, factions, and classes the right to speak, national victory cannot be achieved. After the policy of "Three Thirds System" was proposed, some Communist Party members doubted whether it would weaken the party's leadership. However, this policy not only ensured the leading position of the Communist Party in the regime, but also firmly united the petty-bourgeois masses. Moreover, it attracted all possible forces for unity from the middle bourgeoisie, enlightened individuals from the landlord class, and other sectors of society to consolidate the Communist Party-led anti-Japanese national united front, strengthen the anti-Japanese base areas, and demonstrate the extraordinary leadership ability and superb organizational skills of the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong. The "Three Thirds System" is a specific policy for the construction of the anti-Japanese democratic base areas. It is a unique form under specific historical conditions and has distinct characteristics of the times. However, in terms of its basic spirit, it requires the party to unite the broad masses of people outside the party and practice democratic cooperation with non-party individuals in leading the political work. 
Secondly, fully guarantee the democratic rights of the people in the base areas. Once the organizational principles are determined, how to ensure the implementation of these principles depends on the extraordinary tolerance and serious spirit of our party. During the period of the anti-Japanese war, the broad masses of people in various anti-Japanese base areas were able to participate in the election activities universally and truly exercise their sacred democratic rights. They established a government that cooperated with Communist Party members, various anti-Japanese parties, and independent individuals, and elected capable and experienced people who could represent the interests of the people to leadership positions at all levels. This is an important sign of implementing democratic politics. The leaders of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and other anti-Japanese base areas came from the people. Article 2 of the Election Regulations of the People's Congress at all levels in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region states: "The election system adopted is universal, direct, equal, and secret ballot." Article 3 states: "All people residing within the border area who are eighteen years of age or older, regardless of class, party affiliation, occupation, gender, religion, ethnicity, property and cultural differences, have the right to vote and to be elected. Only traitors who have been sentenced by the court, those deprived of citizenship rights, mentally ill patients, have no right to vote or be elected." Accordingly, all classes engaged in the anti-Japanese struggle, including peasants, workers, landlords, and capitalists, as well as all anti-Japanese parties, including the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and all ethnic groups, including the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan... as long as they are upright, physically healthy, mentally normal, they have the right to vote, be elected, recall, and participate in all political activities within the anti-Japanese base areas. During the election, all parties, organizations, or individuals are free to present their campaign platforms and engage in campaign activities. Not only did the labor masses actively participate in the elections, but the landlords and rich peasants also enthusiastically joined the electoral process. In order to reflect the national equality of the anti-Japanese united front, the anti-Japanese democratic regime has clear provisions on the voting rights of ethnic minorities. Ethnic groups that have reached the statutory number of lawmakers can hold separate elections. Ethnic groups that do not meet the statutory number but have reached one-fifth of the number required for township and county-level elections or one-eighth of the number required for border region elections can also hold separate elections to elect one senator at that level. The proportion of voters participating in the elections also indicates the democratic and egalitarian principles of the anti-Japanese democratic regime. Taking the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region as an example, three democratic elections were held from 1937 to 1946. In the first election from May to November 1937, more than 70% of eligible voters participated. In the second election in 1941, more than 80% of eligible voters participated. From March 1945 to March 1946, during the third election, on average, 82.5% of eligible voters participated, with the highest reaching 96%. The same was true for other anti-Japanese base areas.
In the elections of the seven counties in the Jin-Cha-Ji base in 1940, male and female citizens participating in county elections accounted for 78.3% of the total citizens, male and female citizens participating in district elections accounted for 81.4% of the total citizens, and male and female citizens participating in village elections accounted for 83.9% of the total citizens. Even in some guerrilla areas that were "swept" by the enemy, people's elections did not cease. If elections could not be held during the day, they would be held in the evening; if large gatherings were not possible, they would be conducted in small groups. In short, every effort was made to achieve the goal. The participation of women in politics is a measure of social progress. In the elections in various anti-Japanese base areas, the proportion of women candidates was also large, generally reaching around 80%, with the highest being 90%.The election activities in the anti-Japanese base areas truly embodied the principles of universality, directness, and equality, ensuring that senators at all levels had broad representativeness. Through elections, the political power at all levels was strengthened and consolidated, further strengthening the anti-Japanese unity of the various classes, parties, and nationalities in the base areas, promoting the democratization process of the anti-Japanese base areas, and promoting the development of the anti-Japanese cause.
Third, the implementation of the policy of building a strong army and simplifying administration. From 1941 to 1943, the anti-Japanese base areas led by the Communist Party of China entered the most difficult phase. The area of the base areas was reduced by half, the population of the base areas dropped from 100 million to below 50 million, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army decreased from 500,000 to 300,000, and the military and civilians in the base areas were almost without clothes, oil, and paper. Soldiers had no shoes or socks, and staff members were not covered in winter, facing extremely severe difficulties. In such a harsh situation, the party began to implement the policy of "building a strong army and simplifying administration." In November 1941, Mr. Li Dingming proposed the proposal of "building a strong army and simplifying administration" at the Second Consultative Conference of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, pointing out: "Under the current difficult situation of the people and weak resources, the government should propose a planned economy based on objective material conditions and subjective economic needs to comprehensively improve productivity, improve economic conditions, and strengthen economic foundations; based on the existing economic foundation, the government should formulate a unified economic plan based on the deliberation of suitable personnel; within the financial and economic strength and without affecting the conditions of the anti-Japanese forces, the military should implement the principle of building a strong army, enhance combat effectiveness, and ensure that all soldiers can fight and win, avoiding the phenomenon of including the old, weak, disabled, and incompetent. The government should implement the principle of simplifying administration, enriching government organizations, based on the principle of fewer personnel and precise responsibilities, avoiding the phenomenon of bloated organizations, overcrowded staff, and waste of manpower and financial resources; setting supply conditions to avoid unnecessary supply and consumption; promoting thrift and integrity, and avoiding unnecessary waste." Mao Zedong added a comment to this proposal: "This method is very good, it is precisely the right medicine to reform our bureaucratic, officialist, and formalist tendencies." Subsequently, the Central Committee of the Party issued instructions on building a strong army and simplifying administration to all democratic base areas. The Liberation Daily published many editorials and organized discussions, many of which were drafted by Mao Zedong himself. Mao Zedong pointed out: "This time, building a strong army and simplifying administration must be strict, thorough, and universal, not perfunctory, superficial, or partial. In this process of building a strong army and simplifying administration, we must achieve the five objectives of streamlining, unification, efficiency, thrift, and opposition to bureaucratic tendencies." Starting from the winter of 1941, various anti-Japanese base areas began to implement "building a strong army and simplifying administration." The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Area went through three rounds of streamlining. The internal institutions of various ministries, departments, and institutes were merged by one quarter. The affiliated agencies were reorganized from 1,140 personnel to 991 personnel, and the directly affiliated agencies in the border area were reduced from 35 to 22, with personnel reduced from 469 to 279. After the second reorganization, the total number of county (city) governments and county consultative conferences in the entire area was reduced from the original 1,189 to 397, accounting for 33% of the original number. The working staff of the district offices was reduced from 1,250 to 955, accounting for 75.6% of the original number.Other bases were also streamlined three to four times. The streamlining of troops and simplification of administration began at the end of 1941 and basically ended by the end of 1943. The anti-Japanese democratic base governments claimed to have achieved great success. Some of the personnel who were streamlined returned to the frontlines of production. Through this work, various old and formalistic tendencies in the political system were corrected, thus establishing a centralized leadership system. The tendency towards bureaucraticism in the work was opposed, and work efficiency was improved. The simplification of administration had a positive effect, reducing non-essential personnel and greatly saving costs. Due to the reduction in costs, the amount of public debt collected in each base area correspondingly decreased, with each area reducing it by one-third. This greatly alleviated the burden on the people, enhanced the credibility of the Communist Party-led anti-Japanese democratic regime in the face of severe difficulties, strengthened the blood and flesh connection between the Party and the people, consolidated the anti-Japanese national united front, and created favorable social conditions and material foundations for the victory of the revolution. The period of the War of Resistance Against Japan was an important period for the maturity of the ideological theories, policies, and strategies of our party in terms of economic construction. During this period, the Party Central Committee formulated a series of correct economic policies and accumulated rich experience in guiding economic construction.
First, it established the general principle of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" as the work guideline for financial and economic matters. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to supplement the deficiencies in financial and economic matters and improve the lives of military and civilian personnel, the Communist Party led the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to take the lead in a production movement and achieved great results, enabling us to pass through the most difficult period relatively smoothly. However, there were still different understandings both inside and outside the Party at that time on how to fundamentally solve the financial and supply problems of the border region. Some people, influenced by outdated and conservative views on finance, forgot about developing the economy and opening up sources of revenue. They only focused on the simple issue of fiscal income and expenditures, attempting to solve financial problems by reducing necessary fiscal expenditures. Some others advocated developing production but proposed many adventurous and unrealistic grand plans, such as demanding the construction of heavy industry, large-scale salt production, and large-scale military industry, etc. In order to provide correct guidance for the economic construction of the border region, Mao Zedong made an important report titled "The Economic Problems and Financial Problems During the Period of the War of Resistance Against Japan" in December 1942 at the High-level Meeting of the Northwest Bureau. He correctly summarized the experience and lessons of the financial and economic work in the border region, criticized the two aforementioned erroneous tendencies, and put forward the general guideline of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" for financial and economic work. Mao Zedong said: "The quality of financial policies can indeed affect the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance. It is impossible to solve financial difficulties without a solid economic foundation, and it is impossible to make finance abundant without economic development. Financial difficulties can only be solved through effective economic development. The conservative view that forgets about developing the economy and opening up sources of revenue, and attempts to solve financial difficulties by reducing necessary fiscal expenditures, cannot solve any problem." Here, Mao Zedong clearly pointed out that the fundamental way to solve financial and economic difficulties is to develop the economy, open up sources of revenue, and increase income. In view of this, the Party Central Committee attached great importance to the development of production and the actual effectiveness of production in the border region. It pointed out that all government agencies, schools, and troops must vigorously engage in activities such as vegetable farming, grain cultivation, pig breeding, and charcoal production under wartime conditions. They should develop handicraft industries and partially engage in grain cultivation and other production activities. All factories should base their successes and failures on their own economic results. The common goal of Party branches, administrative leadership, and trade unions in factories is to produce as many and as good products as possible at as low a cost as possible and to sell them as quickly and favorably as possible. This means that when evaluating the economic construction of the base areas, it is not only about how much land was opened up, how much was cultivated, and how many factories were established, but more importantly, it is about how much of the products needed by society were produced and how to effectively unify individual and unit production with the needs of society.
Mao Zedong's general guideline for financial work also clearly stated the fundamental purpose of developing production in the base areas. That is to ensure the supply of war funds, meet the needs of the living and operating expenses of Party, government, and military personnel, and improve the lives of the people.The general guidelines clarify the fundamental guiding ideology of the base economic construction from the aspects of means and purposes.
Secondly, taking agriculture as the mainstay while developing other industries is a strategic policy proposed by the Party for the development of the base economy. What should be the focus of developing the rural base economy? This is a major issue that has not been very clear to the entire party at the beginning. In the first stage of the production movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the army, government institutions, and schools focused on developing agricultural production. By taking agriculture as the mainstay, good results were achieved. In the second stage, in order to quickly solve the pressing issue of self-sufficiency, many army units, government institutions, and schools focused on commerce and neglected agricultural production. Government investment in production also favored industry and commerce over agriculture. This situation of emphasizing commerce and neglecting agriculture is very detrimental to the overall development of the border region's economy and must be corrected. Therefore, Mao Zedong proposed the development of various economic undertakings in the border region, "with agriculture as the primary focus, industry, handicrafts, transportation, and animal husbandry as the secondary focus, and commerce as the third focus", thereby indicating the key points and directions for the development of the base economy. In order to vigorously develop agricultural production in the base area, Mao Zedong, based on reality, also proposed a series of significant economic and technological measures. The main ones are: 1) reducing rents and interest rates, reducing feudal exploitation by landlords on peasants, and stimulating the production interest of the peasants; 2) organizing and establishing various forms of agricultural labor mutual aid organizations, implementing collective production, and improving labor productivity; 3) rewarding production, launching model worker movements, rewarding labor heroes, and advocating labor for wealth; 4) according to local conditions, pragmatically determining measures to increase production; improving and enhancing agricultural technology, such as water conservancy projects and promoting fine varieties. All these measures have played an important role in the development of agricultural production in the base area.
Thirdly, "balancing the public and private interests" or "balancing the military and civilian interests" is an important policy proposed by the Party for correctly handling the different economic relationships in the base area. In terms of the rural base economic development during the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were two different types of economic components from a broad perspective: public economy and people's economy (i.e. private economy). The public economy refers to the agriculture, industry, and commerce operated by the government, army, government institutions, and schools; the people's economy refers to all agriculture, industry, and commerce operated by private individuals. How to correctly handle the relationship between these two different types of economies in the development of the base economy is a very important issue. In the early stages of the war, the Party adopted the policy of "striving for external aid and recuperating the strength of the people" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. On the one hand, it organized and assisted the people in developing production, and on the other hand, it made efforts to alleviate the burden on the people, leading to significant recovery and development of the people's economy. With regards to agriculture, from 1937 to 1940, the cultivated land area increased by about one-third, and grain production increased by about 45% in the span of three years. However, with the serious financial and economic difficulties and the implementation of self-sufficiency tasks, particularly in 1941-1942, more emphasis was placed on the establishment and development of public economy, neglecting the development of people's economy. The government's investment in economic development also mainly went to public enterprises, while private enterprises received very little support. This excessive burden on the masses caused widespread discontent. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of both the public and private sectors to jointly develop the base economy, Mao Zedong proposed the policy of "balancing the public and private interests" or "balancing the military and civilian interests", that is, on the one hand, developing the public economy, and on the other hand, developing the people's economy, implementing a simultaneous development of the public and private sectors.
The implementation of the policy of "taking care of both public and private affairs" or "taking care of both military and civilian affairs" at that time correctly handled the relationship between public and private economies, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of both the public and private sectors for economic development, and achieved relatively good development in both public and private economies. The base areas also gradually realized self-reliance and self-sufficiency through the joint development of public and private economies, achieving self-sufficiency in clothing and food.
Fourth, "unified leadership and decentralized operation" is an important principle put forward by the Party for organizing and leading the economic life of the base areas. Public economy is an important component and leading force of the new democratic economy in the base areas, and its establishment and development have a decisive role in the development of the base area economy. In order to organize and lead the development of the public economy in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, in 1942, the Party Central Committee put forward the principle of "centralized leadership and decentralized operation," and distributed part of the production costs to various units, requiring each unit to operate independently and achieve self-sufficiency in production. However, at that time and for some time afterwards, this principle was not fully implemented. There were too many decentralized operations and insufficient centralized leadership, or even no centralized leadership. This caused great chaos in the economic life of the border region. People focused more on profit-driven commerce and neglected agricultural production. Commercial speculation was very serious, and some even engaged in armed smuggling, tax evasion, and industrial construction without considering the conditions, resulting in some factories being built but unable to start production or ending shortly after starting. Each unit used what they produced for themselves, creating inequalities in hardships and joys. Those who made money had enough to eat and wear, while county and district cadres who had no choice received only two catties of cotton to make their own clothes. This situation was inconsistent with the Party's overall policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply." Therefore, Mao Zedong emphasized again in his report "On the Economic and Financial Issues" that "the development of the public economy must implement the principle of 'unified leadership and decentralized operation'. This applies not only to industry, but also to agriculture and commerce." Mao Zedong further summarized this principle as "unified leadership, decentralized operation." The development of the public economy in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region achieved relatively smooth development and overcame the shortcomings of unequal living conditions for personnel in various fields because this principle was fully implemented from 1943 onwards. The direction of enterprise operations was unified according to systems and levels, the relationships between enterprises were adjusted, the control of production profits was unified under the conditions of allowing a certain portion of the income to be retained by production units, and various aspects were allowed to solve problems independently based on unified plans, policies, and directions. This quickly reversed the previous chaotic situation, and the economy of the border region developed relatively smoothly, overcoming the shortcomings of unequal living conditions for personnel in various fields. Therefore, Mao Zedong said, "'unified leadership, decentralized operation' has been proven to be the correct principle for organizing all economic activities in our liberated areas under current conditions." In terms of cultural construction, the Communist Party of China, as the leader of the base area construction, also directly bears the responsibility for cultural construction. In the case of comprehensive development of the base areas, the principles, tasks, methods, and directions of cultural construction are not only theoretical issues, but have become practical issues. Therefore, the Communist Party of China has made various explorations and formulated comprehensive guidelines and policies. 
First, the basic principle of emphasizing cultural construction in the base areas is to closely focus on the center of the resistance against Japan. At the beginning of the outbreak of the war, Mao Zedong proposed in the article "Guidelines, Methods, and Prospects for Resisting Japanese Aggression" that the education policies and education systems of the past should be fundamentally reformed. Urgent tasks and unreasonable methods should be abolished. News, publishing, film, drama, literature, and art should all serve the interests of national defense. After the war entered a stalemate phase, in October 1938, Mao Zedong further pointed out in the political report "On the New Stage" at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC that "under the principle of putting everything for the sake of the war, all cultural and educational undertakings should be made to meet the needs of the war.Therefore, the following cultural and educational policies must be implemented: First, revise the curriculum, abolish unnecessary courses, change the management system, and prioritize teaching courses necessary for war and promoting students' enthusiasm for learning. Second, establish and expand various cadres schools to cultivate a large number of anti-Japanese cadres. Third, promote mass education, organize various tutoring schools, literacy movements, drama movements, singing movements, sports movements, establish various local popular newspapers in enemy-occupied and rear areas, and enhance people's national culture and national consciousness. Fourth, provide compulsory primary education to educate the new generation with national spirit." The above guidelines and policies highlight a fundamental principle, which is that cultural construction must revolve around the center of the anti-Japanese war and serve the comprehensive and protracted anti-Japanese war.
Second, the basic direction of cultural development is proposed. In January 1940, Mao Zedong delivered a speech entitled "Politics of New Democracy and Culture of New Democracy" (also known as "On New Democracy") at the First Congress of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Area Cultural Association. He systematically discussed the historical process and characteristics of China's modern cultural revolution, and put forward the task of "transforming China, which is ruled by old culture and is ignorant and backward, into a China ruled by new culture and is civilized and advanced." This "new culture" refers to "national, scientific, popular culture, which is the culture of the people opposing imperialism and feudalism." This effectively indicated the direction for the development of the new democratic culture and has immeasurable guiding significance. After the Rectification Movement began, in May 1942, Mao Zedong delivered a speech entitled "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," elaborating on the relationship between literature and art, politics, and the overall revolutionary cause, and not only explicitly stated that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but also further discussed how literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. These have had a significant impact on the cultural construction of the anti-Japanese base areas and have become a powerful driving force for the anti-Japanese cultural movement.
Third, the key to the cultural construction of the anti-Japanese base areas is to have a large number of intellectuals and fully tap into their roles. With the consolidation and expansion of the anti-Japanese base areas, the tasks of propaganda, organization, and arming the masses were extremely arduous. Many cadres and soldiers sacrificed and the numbers decreased in the fierce struggle against the enemy. Therefore, it was urgent to absorb a large number of intellectuals into the Party and the army. Mao Zedong, as the representative of the Communist Party of China, had a clear understanding of this. In December 1939, in his article "Recruiting a Large Number of Intellectuals," Mao Zedong pointed out, "In the long and brutal national liberation war, and in the great struggle to establish a new China, the Communist Party must be good at recruiting intellectuals in order to organize a great anti-Japanese force, organize millions of peasant masses, develop the cultural movement of the revolution, and develop the revolutionary united front. Without the participation of intellectuals, the victory of the revolution is impossible." In December 1940, in the directive "On Policy," drafted by Mao Zedong for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he further proposed, "Educationists, cultural figures, journalists, scholars, and technologists with bourgeois liberal ideas should be allowed to cooperate with us in base areas to set up schools, newspapers, and engage in work. All intellectuals with more enthusiasm for anti-Japanese activities should be recruited into our schools for short-term training to participate in military, government, and social work." During the period of the Anti-Japanese War, the anti-Japanese base areas centered around Yan'an became a place that attracted a large number of patriotic intellectuals, young students, and elites in the cultural field, and they rushed to this place despite the hardships. This is inseparable from the correct policies of the Communist Party of China.
Fourth, specific policies and regulations suitable for the needs of cultural construction in the base areas were formulated. With the gradual implementation of these guidelines and policies, with the continuous expansion and consolidation of the base areas, the cultural propaganda activities of the base areas became increasingly active, and cultural organizations were established one after another.The central Party regards cultural propaganda as an important weapon for educating the masses, organizing the masses, and fighting against enemies. The cultural cause in the anti-Japanese base areas has become "a necessary and important front in the revolutionary united front." The Party has set up cultural management departments within its own organization, and the government has also established cultural management institutions, using various means to promote the development of the cultural cause. In September 1940, in order to carry out the cultural movement of the war of resistance, the CPC Central Committee specially issued the "Central Committee's Instructions on the Development of the Cultural Movement," which required the Party organizations and the army in each base area to "organize planned and implemented propaganda, education, and publishing work to popularize and improve the theoretical and political levels of cadres inside and outside the Party, and to popularize and improve the political levels of the anti-Japanese army and people. It is necessary to ensure that the theoretical, political, and cultural levels of cadres, the army, and the people in each base area are higher and wider than those in other parts of the country... It is necessary to regard the transportation of cultural food as more important than the transportation of clothing and ammunition." In January 1938, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Military, Political, and Civilian Representatives' Conference passed the "Resolution on Culture and Education," which stipulated the basic principles of cultural education: to exert a high national spirit and strengthen the anti-Japanese forces; to cultivate sound military and political cadres and lead the war of resistance; to cultivate specialized technical talents and establish various undertakings during the war of resistance; to cultivate passionate new youth and expand the foundation of the national revolution; to improve the cultural level of the general population and enhance their health. In January 1939, the 1st Shan-Gan-Ning Border Region Congress passed the "Political Program of the Shan-Gan-Ning Border Region during the War of Resistance," which comprehensively discussed the policies of cultural education and cultural construction in the border region; in November of the same year, the 2nd Congress of the Communist Party of China in the Shan-Gan-Ning Border Region made the following resolution on cultural education work in the border region: "Efforts must be made to eliminate the cultural backwardness such as illiteracy, superstition, unhygienic conditions left behind by the old system before the revolution for the broad masses of the people; it must be based on the progressive scientific theoretical basis and strive for the establishment of a new culture for the Chinese nation."
Section 1: The Thought of Establishing the Democratic United Front
I. Establishing the Basic Strategy for Building the Democratic United Front
The Party's theory and strategy of united front originates from the principles of proletarian revolution strategy in Marxism, and it has gone through a logical development process in the specific environment of the Chinese revolution. Its first theoretical and practical achievement in the Chinese revolution is the proposal of the Party's thought of the democratic united front and the realization of the first united cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.
At that time, the Communist Party's understanding of the united front targets was extensive. In January 1923, an article in "Guidance" pointed out that whether "one class, one party" is a revolutionary issue is not fixed and unchangeable. Under certain historical conditions, the proletariat "can unite with any party... any military person in every revolutionary action." But this kind of unity can only be a "revolutionary unity," not a compromise unity. Specifically, among various classes in Chinese society, the Communist Party believed that the national bourgeoisie was one of the revolutionary forces in the democratic revolution stage. The petty bourgeoisie was the basic force of the revolution. The comprador bourgeoisie was fundamentally counter-revolutionary, but because the comprador bourgeoisie represented various imperialist powers, various comprador factions had conflicting interests and conflicts with each other. Therefore, the Japanese compradors such as the "Anfu Faction" could cooperate with the anti-British movement in the national revolution, while the "Research Faction" often opposed the Fengtian warlords. The proletariat "should make the best use of" the "internal conflicts" of this kind to weaken the "enemy's strength."
Based on the above principles, the Communist Party analyzed the situation of various political forces in China before and after the 2nd National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and believed that "only the Kuomintang can be considered as a revolutionary democratic faction, and relatively a genuine democratic faction." Therefore, the "Resolution on the 'Democratic United Front'" adopted at the 2nd National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to "invite the Kuomintang and the Socialist Youth League to hold representative conferences in suitable places in advance, and discuss how to invite other progressive organizations and how to conduct" the united front work. It indicated that while the Party was mainly forming an alliance with the Kuomintang, it also aimed to unite with other "progressive organizations" to form a broad democratic united front.At that time, considering that Wu Peifu had shown some support for the people's movement, the communists believed that it made sense to unite with Wu Peifu in the fight against the "Red Beards" (referring to Zhang Zuolin). Therefore, while the revolutionary party advocated "fundamentally...joining forces with the masses," they did not exclude the possibility of implementing certain "meaningful unilateral alliances" with Wu Peifu. In 1923, Wu Peifu orchestrated the "March 7th Massacre," prompting the Chinese communists to immediately adopt a resolute attitude of overthrowing the direct military warlords. With the help of the Communist International, the party achieved cooperation with the Kuomintang in early 1924. However, the party's united front at this time was still not singular. In October 1924, Feng Yuxiang launched a coup in Beijing. After observing for a period of time, the communists adopted a policy of uniting with Feng Yuxiang and the National Army. After the anti-warlord war broke out, the democratic tendencies of Feng Yuxiang's National Army became more apparent, and other political forces also put forward their demands for democratic politics. In this particular situation, the Chinese communists proposed that the Guangzhou National Government, the National Army, various sectors of industry, agriculture, commerce, and education, nationalist factions, right-wing and left-wing factions of the Kuomintang, and communist factions should "unite together" to promote a National Assembly and create a "genuine republic." However, due to the rapid reversal of the anti-warlord war situation, the above-mentioned proposals of the Chinese communists were not implemented. Nevertheless, the National Army became the united front's second most important ally after the Kuomintang. These theories and policies of the party reflect the basic principles of utilizing contradictions, winning over the majority, and uniting all possible forces under specific historical conditions in order to strike the main enemy. 
Among the two main allies at the time, the communists believed that Feng Yuxiang's National Army represented the "anti-bourgeois rural bourgeoisie." However, there was a complex situation in understanding the class content of the Kuomintang. At the beginning of the democratic revolution topic being put on the party's agenda, the communists pointed out that the democrats, led by the Kuomintang, represented the "bourgeoisie." However, the content of the so-called bourgeoisie was not yet clear. From the analysis in the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China, the term "bourgeoisie" included both the "industrial and commercial bourgeoisie" and the "petty bourgeoisie." But in the same document, when discussing the issue of alliance between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, it only mentioned the need to "establish a united front with the petty bourgeoisie for democratic socialism." It seems that the so-called democratic bourgeoisie represented by the Kuomintang and other groups specifically referred to the petty bourgeoisie. 
First, it was pointed out by the representative of the Communist International, Marin, that the Kuomintang was a multi-class political party. In July 1922, in his report to the Executive Committee of the Communist International, he pointed out that the Kuomintang was composed of four components: "intellectuals," "overseas Chinese," "soldiers," and "workers." "Overseas Chinese" were the "capitalist element" within the Kuomintang. In January of the following year, the Executive Committee of the Communist International further pointed out in the resolution "Regarding the Relationship between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang" that the social base of the Kuomintang included the "liberal bourgeoisie," "petty bourgeoisie," "intellectuals and workers" as four components. The Chinese communists quickly accepted the Communist International's view that the Kuomintang was a temporary alliance of four classes and pointed out that the interests of the bourgeoisie and the interests of the working masses were fundamentally in conflict within this temporary alliance.
In May 1924, the Third Plenary Session of the Party analyzed this objective fact and began to divide the Kuomintang into left and right factions. However, the specific class content of the left and right factions was not yet specified. In the second half of 1924, the communists further divided the Kuomintang into left, center, and right factions. At that time, there was no unified view on the class content of these three factions. In July 1926, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party further divided the Kuomintang into four forces: warlords, compradors, bureaucrats, and other semi-feudal forces, with the right faction representing them. The representatives of the working masses were the Communists. The representatives of the petty bourgeoisie were the left faction. The representatives of the national bourgeoisie were the new right or center factions. Basically, the class content of the various factions of the Kuomintang was clarified. Based on this, the plenary session put forward the strategy of "uniting with the left and center factions and attacking the reactionary right faction." It clearly defined the main united front targets of the Party as the petty bourgeoisie represented by the left faction of the Kuomintang and the national bourgeoisie represented by the center faction.
Among the two classes that can be united, the Communists believed that the petty bourgeoisie was a reliable force for revolution, while the national bourgeoisie had a "contradictory" attitude towards revolution, occupying a special position in the revolution. Around the Second and Third National Congresses of the Communist Party, the Communists pointed out that the strength of the Chinese bourgeoisie was still very "immature" and could not become an "independent class force"; it inevitably had a tendency to "compromise" and "seek personal gain" in the revolution. However, the Communists still believed at that time that the bourgeoisie should occupy the main position in the democratic revolution. "Recognizing that the revolution of democracy is undoubtedly in the interest of the bourgeoisie." The role and position of the bourgeoisie were obviously overestimated. In May 1924, after the Third Plenary Session of the Party, the Communists further pointed out that the revolutionary nature of the bourgeoisie was "always intermittent" and "the higher the bourgeoisie, the more inclined towards compromise." Their participation in the revolution "cannot be maintained to the end." However, the Communists also excessively ignored the reality of the strength of the national bourgeoisie. They believed that it was still in the transition from the comprador class to the national industrial bourgeoisie and could not yet participate in the revolution. They also had no intention of seizing revolutionary leadership. This viewpoint persisted for a long time and was the theoretical root of the party's inability to raise the issue of contending for leadership with the bourgeoisie for quite some time. It was not until the first half of 1926 that Mao Zedong, in his article "The Reasons for the Separation of the Rightists in the Kuomintang and Their Effects on the Revolutionary Future," truly pointed out the attempt and actions of the Chinese bourgeoisie to monopolize revolutionary leadership and achieve the future of capitalism. In July of the same year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party also pointed out that "China's bourgeoisie has gradually become an important component of the national movement and tends to lead this movement," and its armed forces are gradually "forming."
However, its "compromising character" remains severe, as it will "betray the revolution and collaborate with the enemy" once it achieves some minor victories. Therefore, the Party should, on the one hand, "promote the revolutionization of the bourgeoisie" and regard it as a "friendly force". On the other hand, it must prevent future dangers and strive to compete for the leadership position in the revolutionary movement with the bourgeoisie. It is recognized that the national bourgeoisie always exhibits ambivalence during the democratic revolution stage. Its weakness lies not in the lack of desire to seize leadership, but rather in its tendency to lead the revolution to failure according to its own weak will. It is pointed out that the proletariat must both unite with the national bourgeoisie and be vigilant against its betrayal, making every effort to compete for the revolutionary leadership. This is completely correct in theory. However, the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, while correcting the mistake of neglecting the presence of the bourgeoisie, portrayed it as an indispensable force in the revolution. The special role of the Chinese national bourgeoisie has still not been fully recognized.
From the above analysis, it can be seen that Chinese communists fundamentally elucidated the correct attitude of the proletariat towards the alliance objects during the period of the Great Revolution. However, they were seriously influenced by the Comintern's "formalization" error in determining the political representatives of the united front classes. At that time, the communists regarded the Left, Centre, and Right factions of the Kuomintang as the political representatives of the petit bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and landlord and comprador bourgeoisie, respectively. This can be considered relatively reasonable, but it was still overly simplistic and absolutist. The error lies in the further fixation of Jiang Jieshi's group as the core of the Centre and Wang Jingwei as the representative of the Left, failing to recognize that since the boundaries between various sections of the bourgeoisie and the boundaries between them and imperialist and feudal forces were not completely delineated in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the factions and their representatives, which represent different sections of the bourgeoisie, could not have absolutely different positions. Failure to perceive the complexity of the political figures such as Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei, who originated from the complex Chinese society, and their complex relationship with the landlord and comprador bourgeoisie, also prevented recognition of the complexity and variability of their class attributes. Therefore, before April 12th, under the leadership of Chen Duxiu, the Central Committee of the Party, especially the Comintern, always accommodated Jiang Jieshi. After April 12th, the communists accepted the Comintern's revolutionary "three-stage" theory in the overall sense, considered Jiang Jieshi's betrayal as a sign of the entire national bourgeoisie turning reactionary, and put forward the slogan "oppose the bourgeoisie", disregarding the ambivalence of the national bourgeoisie. They fundamentally limited their united front targets to the so-called Left faction of the Kuomintang, centered around the Wang Jingwei group, and had unrealistic hopes for them.
II.The issue of "leadership" and "independence" was initially addressed within the framework of the united front.
During the democratic revolution stage, Marxist-Leninist principles identified two basic principles for the alliance between the proletariat and the democratic bourgeoisie. First, the proletariat must hold the leadership position in the alliance. Second, the proletariat must maintain complete independence. The Chinese communists' understanding and recognition of these two principles underwent a complicated process during the initial establishment of the united front.
The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China made the following provisions regarding the principles of the alliance: the proletariat's alliance with the democratic bourgeoisie is only to "assist the democratic revolution" and "not to surrender to the representatives of the bourgeoisie and become their appendage". At the same time as the alliance, it is necessary to unite under the "Communist Party's banner and independently carry out the movement of their own class".Here, the independent thinking of the proletarians in the united front revolution is distinct. However, the Communist Party did not point out the feasibility of proletarian leadership at the meeting, and understood independence as the inability of the proletariat to achieve thorough liberation in the democratic revolution, thus necessitating independent class struggle. They acted not as masters but as assistants to gain some immediate benefits without forming alliances. In August 1922, with the assistance of the Communist International, the Party established the policy of unity within the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. By the end of the same year, the Party spokesperson at the Fourth Congress of the Communist International stated that when cooperating with the Kuomintang, the Chinese Communist Party should "compete with the Kuomintang" in terms of organizing and educating the masses, and "divide the Kuomintang." This indicates that at the beginning of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the Party considered striving for leadership within the cooperation. 
However, the Fourth Congress of the Communist International rejected this principle and made the decision on Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. Therefore, at the Third Congress of the Party, communists engaged in intense debates on the principle issue of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. Chen Duxiu and others fully accepted the decision of the Communist International, advocating that all communist party members join the Kuomintang, and industrial workers also join the Kuomintang, with the belief that "all work goes to the Kuomintang." This faction held a positive attitude towards the issue of cooperation but mistakenly believed that the party's independence was "not a problem" in the future, showing a tendency to neglect the party's independence. Cai Hesen and other leaders believed that it was necessary to "maintain the party's independence" fully after joining the Kuomintang. However, this faction understood independence as not all communist party members joining the Kuomintang and industrial workers "should not join the Kuomintang." Their understanding of "independence" still had simplistic and superficial flaws.
These two opinions reached a consensus in the resolutions of the Third Congress. The principles of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, as reflected in the documents of the Third Congress, are as follows: (1) Political independence, which means maintaining the thorough revolutionary political character of the proletarian party by not compromising with any imperialists or warlords. (2) Organizational independence, where joining the Kuomintang still maintains the "organization" of the party and requires "strict" adherence to party discipline, further "expanding" the party's organization. (3) Independence in the workers' movement, which means engaging in the national revolution while not abandoning the "special work" of the Communist Party, specifically, the independent development of the trade union movement and the class struggle of the working class. (4) Resistance to the Kuomintang's erroneous policies and actions.(5) The leader of the National Revolution is recognized as the Kuomintang. These principles, except for the fifth one which is relatively complex to understand, are basically correct in theory. The drawback is that the third principle only emphasizes the independence of the labor movement, without pointing out the right for the party to maintain independent activity in mass movements such as those of peasants and petty bourgeoisie. At the same time, the content of independence only refers to the party maintaining independence in terms of organization, propaganda, and mass movements, without addressing the issue of independently engaging in political and military work. The principle of "cooperation" still remains greatly one-sided. In November 1923, the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party made some new decisions regarding the principle of cooperation. It required Communist Party members and young members of the Youth League to "strive to hold a central position within the Kuomintang." This theoretically involved the principle of the Communist Party striving for overall leadership within the united front. However, this idea was not upheld and developed, and in the specific work after the establishment of cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists, even the independence of the party organization and mass movements proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party was not implemented, and the mistake of bringing all work into the Kuomintang occurred. The Third Meeting of the Third Executive Committee of the Party made preliminary corrections to this mistake, and the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party earnestly summarized the practical experience of the cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists, adding new content to the principle of cooperation, as follows:① Confirming the leading role of the proletariat in the democratic revolution. ② Emphasizing more explicitly the fundamental work of independently carrying out "industrial workers' movements are the work of the proletarian party". ③ Proposing the principle that industrial workers "must join the Kuomintang only when they have job-related needs". ④ Preliminarily putting forward the task of independently organizing the peasant movement. The resolution on the peasant movement adopted at the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that in the peasant movement, the Communist Party "must independently carry out open propaganda and branch work outside of the Kuomintang".
The proposal of the above principles indicates that the communists have gained further understanding of the special position of the proletarian party in cooperation. However, these principles have yet to be transformed into correct practical policies. The leadership of the proletariat still only refers to the leadership of the proletariat party over popular movements. "Independence" still only means independently conducting the worker and peasant movements. Furthermore, it requires the entire party to maintain a certain distance from allies in the worker and peasant movements, especially in the industrial workers' movement, in order to implement the policy of industrial workers "joining the Kuomintang based on their needs". There is a lack of independent engagement in and leadership over political power and military work, in order to change the balance of power in cooperation and ensure that the united front plays its role according to the will of the proletariat and its political party, thereby transforming the victory of the democratic revolution into the victory of the proletariat and realizing the socialist future.
The New Rightists of the Kuomintang are also intolerant of the limited independent activity of the Chinese Communist Party. The occurrence of incidents such as the Zhongshan Warship Incident and the Party Affairs Reorganization Case indicates that the Rightists have begun to gradually restrict and abolish the Communist Party's independent activity.After the establishment of the Headquarters of the Northern Expedition Army, Chiang Kai-shek openly used the Northern Expedition as an excuse to issue a series of laws restricting the independent struggle of the workers and peasants. In view of the above situation, the Chinese Communists proposed the idea of "withdrawing from the Kuomintang" and "preparing independent military forces" to confront Chiang Kai-shek. However, the Communist International did not support the Chinese Communists' independent military action and "firmly opposed the demand to withdraw from the Kuomintang," and did not allow the existence of a stance that "inevitably leads to the withdrawal from the Kuomintang." It also clearly stated that the "independence of the Chinese Communist Party" should not be understood in this way. In July 1926, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee of the Party raised the issue of the proletarian and bourgeois struggle for leadership and emphasized that the Party should "further strengthen its independence politically" and "establish its influence among workers and the majority of peasants." This indicates that the entire Party has become more aware of the significance of the proletariat's acquisition of revolutionary leadership and maintaining independence in a series of betrayals by Chiang Kai-shek. The problem still lies in the fact that neither "leadership" nor "independence" is directly linked to the issues of armed struggle and political power. It explicitly states that it only helps the Left without "replacing the Left." This proposal is almost a direct copy of the Communist International's instruction not to attempt to use Communist Party members to replace the "Left" in leadership positions. Its mistaken source is clearly the Communist International.
After the development of the Northern Expedition War reached the Yangtze River Valley, the activities of the right-wing of the Kuomintang against the workers and peasants became more apparent, making the seriousness of the expanding power of Chiang Kai-shek even more clear to the Communists. The report from the Central Committee of the Party pointed out that since the incident with the Zhongshan warship, the Chiang Kai-shek group has gradually squeezed out the Communist Party and the Left of the Kuomintang, forming a "centrist regime with an influential momentum," and "part of the Left leaders have completely wavered." In this situation, the Communists concluded that they should not replace the Left in leadership positions, but rather help the Left gain the support of the masses and "take responsibility for themselves." The Special Meeting in Hankou in December 1926 (also known as the December Special Meeting) clearly stated that the Party should not monopolize "all popular movements in the areas of workers, peasants, business, and academia" and "political struggles," and explained that the Party's independence only refers to the "political propaganda and organization." The previous emphasis on the independence of the workers and peasants movement was also abandoned. Of course, this change emphasized the need for cooperation with the Left in workers and peasants movements and political struggles to avoid "conflict with the Kuomintang as a whole," which is not without reason. The problem is that the meeting did not propose specific measures for the Party to strengthen the Left in order to achieve comprehensive leadership in the democratic revolution. Instead, it suggested that the Party should give up some power to the Left, which created a decrease in the principle of cooperation. In the spring of 1927, when the resolutions of the Seventh Expanded Plenum of the Communist International arrived in China, especially after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, the Communists accepted the international theory of the "three stages" of revolution. They believed that the Chinese revolution had entered the period of the alliance of the working class, peasantry, and petty bourgeoisie, and that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was to jointly establish and lead a democratic dictatorship of the working class, peasantry, and petty bourgeoisie, which made their alliance even "stronger." But in reality, this was not the case. The closer it got to the later stages of the revolution, the leftists, represented by Wang Jingwei, quickly transformed into representatives of the landlord and comprador classes, and the signs of betrayal became increasingly evident, making the situation even more severe. Despite the theoretical belief that "cooperation" had become closer, the Communists and representatives of the Communist International also saw the seriousness of this situation from a practical perspective.
However, they did not provide a practical answer to how to maintain the independence of the proletariat under these conditions. Representative of the international, Lo Yi, spoke on the relationship between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and the independence of the Communist Party in a report to the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, emphasizing that despite Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, the Communist Party still had to maintain its "independence" within the Kuomintang. However, when it came to specific ways to maintain independence, he only repeated the three principles of "developing land revolution, strengthening the workers' movement, and striving for the petite bourgeoisie," without providing concrete methods. Afterwards, Lo Yi proposed to overthrow the Kuomintang Central Committee through a coup d'état in order to change the nature of the cooperation and maintain the independence of the Communist Party. This is clearly unrealistic. The Communist International sent a "May directive" late, proposing to establish "eight or ten divisions with reliable commanders" and to establish a "revolutionary military court" to punish reactionary officers. In terms of basic theory, this directive is obviously correct. But under the conditions at that time, this path was obviously not feasible.
At the same time, the Communist Party of China's united front principles also underwent changes. During the leadership of the armed uprising of Shanghai workers, the party explicitly put forward the principle of workers leading the armed uprising, seizing power, convening a People's Representative Conference of all sectors to establish a civilian democratic regime, and at one point partially realized this principle. Here, "leadership" and "independence" were first connected to the issues of armed struggle and political power. However, the method of seizing power in Shanghai itself was not suitable for the objective reality of Chinese society, and combined with the disparity in strength, both the uprising and the struggle to establish a democratic regime failed. At the same time, the Communist International did not support the method of the armed uprising in Shanghai to seize power, and advocated that communists join the Nationalist government in Wuhan. The Chinese Communists accepted the advice of the Communist International and decided to participate in the Wuhan government and the local levels of the Nationalist Party's power, transforming them into a democratic dictatorship of the working class, the peasantry, and the petite bourgeoisie. The theoretical content of independently engaging in political activities still remained. However, as the Communists failed to propose fundamental and effective measures to transform the army into the pillar of the political power, the goal of transforming the Nationalist Party's regime became futile, and the independence and leadership of the party were increasingly threatened, ultimately resulting in the loss of independence and leadership.
III. Establishing the Form of Intra-Party Cooperation
When the issue of establishing a united front was put on the agenda, the Chinese Communists and the Communist International had significant differences in the form of "cooperation," and it was not until the August 1922 West Lake Conference that the form of cooperation within the Kuomintang was tentatively determined. Based on the activities of the party at the First National Congress of the Kuomintang and afterwards, the form of cooperation within the Kuomintang as understood by the Communist International and the Chinese Communists at that time included three aspects.
First, Communist Party members in China joined the Kuomintang as individuals. In the history of the international communist movement, the form of communists joining democratic parties has precedents to follow.Marx and Engels led the members of the Communist League to participate in democratic organizations in Germany during the 1848 European Revolution. In 1917, Lenin also guided members of the Indonesian Social Democratic Union to join the bourgeois Islamic League. The first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China was based on this experience. However, there were few similarities between these two alliances. Although Indonesia was a backward colonial country in Asia, its political environment had many characteristics of Western countries. Therefore, although the revolution in Indonesia belonged to a national revolution, it could largely adopt the methods of Western democratic revolutions. China, on the other hand, was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with no democratic tradition and no bourgeoisie democracy to rely on. This led to the necessity of a special form of cooperation between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang that was suitable for the Chinese situation. Members of the Chinese Communist Party joined the Kuomintang as individuals and, under the guidance of the Comintern, helped the Kuomintang establish a party and an army in the style of Soviet Russia, and later helped it establish a strong government. This was unprecedented in the history of the international communist movement, but it was necessary due to China's unique national conditions.
Since the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party took a special form, corresponding special strategies had to be adopted to ensure the success of the cooperative cause. Because, under the conditions in China at the time, a tightly organized and disciplined party, a strong armed force, and a power that combined with such a party and army, if held by the proletariat, would become a powerful weapon for the struggle of the people's liberation and the exercise of their rights. However, if combined with dictatorial forces, it would easily turn into a fascist-style tool of personal dictatorship. Sun Yat-sen was a loyal democratic fighter, and he personally regarded all of this as a republican weapon. However, the Kuomintang was not Sun Yat-sen's personal party. Different representatives of different classes mixed within the Kuomintang, and anti-communist and anti-Soviet forces were manifested from the beginning. The factors for establishing a personal fascist dictatorship by utilizing the party, government, and military organizations of the Kuomintang were initially apparent and gradually developed.
The Chinese Communists, especially the Comintern, the designers of the cooperation project between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, wanted to help a party that was not proletarian to establish a tightly organized organization, a powerful army, and a government that it could control. Therefore, they had to have a clear and firm general policy from the beginning to ensure that the political entity they helped to build would function according to their own will and not become a separate force.
However, the Comintern did not do this when determining the cooperation within the Chinese Communist Party. The strategies of the Chinese Communists also had shortcomings. As mentioned earlier, since the Second National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the party had formed the following understanding: after the success of the democratic revolution, the proletariat could not achieve complete liberation and must carry out a second revolution against the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the cooperation between the proletarian party and the democratic Kuomintang was a temporary strategy. The participation of the proletariat in the democratic revolution was seen as assisting the democratic parties, and this "assistance" mentality existed for a considerable period of time. The Fourth National Congress of the Party proposed the policy of limited participation of the working class in the Kuomintang according to needs and not expanding the organization of the Kuomintang when it was not necessary, which narrowed the scope of assistance. However, in essence, this meant maintaining a certain distance from the democratic parties. The Comintern regarded the changes in the principles of cooperation at the Fourth National Congress as a transition from the "close alliance" between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to a "political union". This explanation was very ambiguous and did not clarify the exact meaning and specific form of a "political union", nor did it indicate the specific differences between a "political union" and a "close alliance".
Due to the lack of specific guidelines and strategies for guiding cooperation within the Chinese Communist Party during the implementation of the cooperation between the Communist International and the Chinese Communists, the leading organ of cooperation gradually transformed into a tool of dictatorship after the death of Sun Yat-sen. After Sun Yat-sen's death, the "Xishan Conference faction" emerged, opposing the "Three Principles" policy. Chiang Kai-shek took advantage of these anti-communist forces to gradually carry out his dictatorial conspiracy, completely seizing control of the Kuomintang political machine during the Northern Expedition and using it to restrict the independent activities of workers and peasants. Faced with the increasingly obvious signs of the new warlord dictatorship, the Communist International did not remind and caution the Chinese Communists to take effective measures to stop this dangerous development, and their strategy remained blind. The Chinese Communists, however, clearly saw this danger and put forward the slogan of opposing both the Northern warlords' dictatorship and the new military dictatorship.
In response to the development of the right-wing military dictatorship trend within the Kuomintang, the Communists also proposed changing the form of cooperation. After the Zhongshan Ship Incident, the Communists advocated "withdrawing from the Kuomintang," which effectively meant transforming internal party cooperation into external alliance. However, this proposal was rejected by the Communist International. In the Fourth Plenum of the Third Executive Committee, the party proposed partial modifications to the form of cooperation and stated in the resolution: "The Kuomintang's organization cannot be a centralized party in the form of a class, with strict discipline and regulations. Many petty-bourgeois revolutionary masses must be brought into the Kuomintang, so the organizational form of the party can be more accommodating... It should have the nature of a political club." Tan Pingshan, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, submitted a written report to the Seventh Executive Committee of the Communist International, pointing out: "The Kuomintang's organizational regulations are almost as strict and rigid as the Communist Party's regulations, which do not meet the needs of China. These strict regulations not only have no benefits, but are even harmful." It was not until May 1927 that the Communist International formally recognized the viewpoint of the Chinese Communists. The resolution of the Eighth Executive Committee of the Communist International on the Chinese issue stated: "The tasks facing the Kuomintang require corresponding changes in its organizational form. It must quickly reorganize based on a route that brings it closer to the masses... it must collectively accept the organization of workers, peasants, soldiers, and artisans... and join the Kuomintang." This proposed a reorganization plan opposite to the one in 1924, but these proposals were not implemented and had no possibility of being implemented.
Faced with the grave situation, the Chinese Communists and the Communist International did not take effective measures to reverse the transformation of the united front organ into a tool of dictatorship. After the Zhongshan Ship Incident, the Central Committee led by Chen Duxiu adopted a policy of compromise. During the Northern Expedition, the Central Committee proposed to resist the trend of dictatorship through a broad movement of the National Congress. They also initiated the "Party Power Movement," the "Welcoming Wang Jingwei to Resume Office" movement within the Kuomintang, and tried to maintain a "balance of power" among various military and political factions, attempting to halt Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial progress through these means but without proposing truly effective measures. The Communist International advocated for a large number of revolutionary masses to quickly join the Kuomintang to eliminate the trend of dictatorship. At the Seventh Expanded Executive Committee, the Communist International further proposed the principle of Communist Party members participating in the National Government, expanding the scope of "party cooperation" from within the party and the military to the government. This was a major evolution in the form of the first cooperation between the Nationalist Party and the Communists. The Eighth Executive Committee further emphasized this principle and proposed the task of the Communist Party seizing leadership within the Kuomintang. However, this did not aim to change the power balance within the united front, but rather to ensure a smooth transition from democratic revolution to socialist revolution.
Stalin asserted based on the experience of the "October Revolution" that it was impossible to transition from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution by transforming the Kuomintang government into a dictatorship of the proletarian and petty-bourgeoisie. He believed that, ultimately, just like the October Revolution, the transformation of the two-step revolution could only be achieved by overthrowing the transitional government established during the democratic revolution through armed conflict. However, the Communist International (Comintern) still did not propose a clear policy for the independent armed struggle of the Communist Party, and its strategy was contradictory. Under the leadership of Chen Duxiu, the Central Committee of the party was unable to make decisive decisions and take effective measures to reverse the crisis due to this misguided policy guidance and the objective environment of violence and turmoil.
History proves that in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the Communist Party adopted the form of cooperation within the Kuomintang (KMT) to establish a united front for revolution, assisting the KMT in organizing a centralized and unified party, a strong armed force, and an effective government in the manner of the Soviet Party and military. This policy itself was correct and played a significant historical role. However, the Comintern and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led by Chen Duxiu only focused on the independence of the party's organization and mass movements. They did not seize comprehensive leadership within the united front and did not adopt a strategy to surpass their allies in terms of overall strength, which created sharp contradictions between content and form. Undoubtedly, this is one of the significant reasons for the losses in the Great Revolution.
During the period of the Great Revolution, the Communist Party of China was still in its infancy. The entire party, including the theoretical strategies of Mao Zedong, inevitably carried the characteristics of this early stage. Therefore, the party was not yet able to completely and correctly resolve all the theoretical and strategic issues regarding the united front. It was only during the new period of the War of Resistance against Japan, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, that the party concentrated the wisdom and experience of the entire party, greatly developed and enriched the theory and strategy of the first united front. They established a broader united front for the anti-Japanese national war, primarily marked by the second cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists, which played an important role in the fight for victory in the War of Resistance.
Section 2: Thoughts and Policy Strategies for Establishing the Anti-Japanese National United Front
I. Establishment of the principle of independence and autonomy within the Anti-Japanese National United Front
The Anti-Japanese National United Front is an extensive alliance advocated by the Communist Party of China, based on the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, including all classes, factions, political parties, organizations, patriotic individuals, ethnic minorities, compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, as well as overseas Chinese, who were all involved in resisting Japan. During this period of the war against Japan, it mobilized the national army and the general public to the maximum extent, becoming the most effective organizational form for the nationwide resistance and the decisive factor in defeating the Japanese aggressors. The formation and application of the thoughts, policies, and strategies of the Anti-Japanese National United Front was a great achievement of the Communist Party of China in combining the strategic thinking of the proletarian revolution with the concrete practice of leading the Chinese resistance against Japan.
The principle of "independence and autonomy within the Anti-Japanese National United Front" of the Communist Party of China means maintaining the party's political, ideological, and organizational independence while also seeking unity. The essence of this principle is to uphold the party's leadership within the Anti-Japanese National United Front and the War of Resistance against Japan.
From December 1935 to July 1937, during this phase, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Mao Zedong proposed the policy of establishing a united front to resist Japanese aggression, while emphasizing the CPC's leadership in the united front. This laid the theoretical foundation for the principle of "independence and autonomy" in the anti-Japanese united front. In late December 1935, the CPC Central Committee held a Politburo meeting in Yan’an, Shaanxi Province. On December 25th, the meeting passed the Resolution on the Current Political Situation and Party Tasks (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution"). The "Resolution" proposed that the party's line is to "mobilize, unite, and organize all revolutionary forces of the Chinese nation" and establish "the widest anti-Japanese united front". While emphasizing the establishment of the anti-Japanese united front, the "Resolution" also stressed the leadership of the Communist Party in the united front. The "Resolution" pointed out that the Communist Party "should resolutely fight against all tendencies of vacillation, compromise, surrender, and betrayal within the united front against Japan" and "seize its leadership in the anti-Japanese front through its thorough, correct, and anti-Japanese anti-traitor's words and actions". "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the anti-Japanese movement achieve a thorough victory." After the meeting, Mao Zedong made a report entitled "On the Strategy of Opposing Japanese Imperialism" at a meeting of party activists, systematically clarifying the issue of the CPC's leadership in the anti-Japanese united front. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Communist Party and the Red Army are not only the initiators of the anti-Japanese united front at present, but they will also become strong pillars in the future anti-Japanese government and anti-Japanese army." "As long as the Communist Party and the Red Army themselves exist and develop, the anti-Japanese united front will inevitably also exist and develop. This is the leadership role of the Communist Party and the Red Army in the united front." Mao Zedong also cited the failure of the 1927 revolution as an example, emphasizing the importance of the party's leadership in the united front. On April 20, 1936, Zhang Wentian emphasized in his article "Several Issues on the People's United Front against Japan" that "the Communist Party, the Soviet, and the Red Army must become the strong core of the united front," and "the Communist Party, the Soviet, and the Red Army must promote, create, and expand the people's united front against Japan in action and struggle. We are the locomotive and driving force of the people's united front against Japan." On September 1, 1936, the CPC Central Committee, in its "Directive on the Issue of Pressuring Chiang into Resistance against Japan", pointed out on the one hand that "our general policy should be to pressure Chiang into resisting Japan", and on the other hand, it emphasized that "we are the organizers and leaders of the united front against Japan, which includes all parties and factions nationwide (including the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek)". In early to mid-May 1937, the CPC Central Committee held a National Party Representative Conference in Yan'an, where Mao Zedong delivered a report entitled "The Tasks of the Communist Party of China in the Period of Resistance against Japan" and drew conclusions in the report "The Struggle to Gain the Support of Millions of People in the United Front against Japan". Mao Zedong pointed out: "Should the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie, or should the bourgeoisie follow the proletariat? This is the key issue of the leadership responsibility of the Chinese revolution." "Today, the bourgeoisie represented by the Kuomintang still carries a lot of passivity and conservatism." "This situation has increased the political leadership responsibilities of the proletariat and its political party." Mao Zedong further pointed out: "How does the proletariat, through its political party, achieve political leadership over all revolutionary classes throughout the country? First, based on the course of historical development, we should put forward basic political slogans, and mobilize slogans for each stage of development and each major event in order to realize these slogans," "as specific goals for unified action of the people of the whole country." "Second, when taking action nationwide in accordance with these specific goals, the proletariat, especially its vanguard, the Communist Party, should arouse its unlimited enthusiasm and loyalty, and become a model for realizing these specific goals." "Third, on the basis of not deviating from definite political goals, establish appropriate relations with allies, and develop and consolidate this alliance."Fourth, the development of the Communist Party, the unity of ideology, and the strictness of discipline." Mao Zedong also used the lesson of the failure of the revolution caused by Chen Duxiu's right-leaning surrenderism, which "lowered the party's position, blurred the party's image, and sacrificed the interests of the workers and peasants," to illustrate the importance of adhering to the proletariat's leadership in the united front.
From August 1937 to November 1937, the CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong explicitly put forward the principle of independence and autonomy in the united front and gave a preliminary explanation of this principle. After the start of the national anti-Japanese war in July 1937, representatives of the Communist Party of China, such as Zhou Enlai, Qin Bangxian, and Lin Biao, continued negotiations with representatives of the Kuomintang on issues such as cooperation between the two parties and the reorganization of the Red Army. On August 1st, Mao Zedong and Zhang Wentian pointed out in a telegram to Zhou Enlai, Qin Bangxian, and Lin Biao that after the reorganization of the Red Army, it should "carry out guerrilla warfare under the overall strategic policy of independent and dispersed operations," and "not be constrained in the tactics of battles," only in this way can the Red Army exert its special strengths and deal a considerable blow to the Japanese invaders. On August 4th, Mao Zedong and Zhang Wentian instructed Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Ye Jianying that they should propose "combining regular warfare with guerrilla warfare, with the Red Army and other suitable forces taking part, and under the overall strategic layout, exercise independent and autonomous command." In late August 1937, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an enlarged meeting in Luochuan, Shaanxi Province. The meeting decided to adhere to the leading role of the proletariat in the united front, launch independent and autonomous mountain guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, open up the rear anti-Japanese battlefield, and establish anti-Japanese base areas; in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, launch mass movements against Japan, and strive for the political and economic rights that the people of the whole country deserve; reduce rent and interest as the basic policy for solving the peasant issue during the anti-Japanese war. In October 1937, Mao Zedong once again explained in a conversation with British journalist Bethune, "The tactics used by the Eighth Route Army are called independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare." Obviously, from early August to October 1937, the party central committee and Mao Zedong had already clearly put forward the principle of "independence and autonomy," but at this time, "independence and autonomy" mainly referred to military independence and autonomy. On November 12, 1937, Mao Zedong emphasized at the Communist Party Activist Conference in Yan'an the importance of closely linking the principle of independence and autonomy to all work in the united front, and pointed out that "the explanation, practice, and adherence to the principle of independence and autonomy in the united front is the central link that leads the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war to victory." In this way, the principle of independence and autonomy in the anti-Japanese national united front was explicitly and fully put forward.
From November 1937 to November 1938, the CPC Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, fought against Wang Ming's right-leaning errors, establishing the principle of independence and autonomy in the anti-Japanese national united front throughout the party. At the end of November 1937, Wang Ming, the representative of the CPC to the Comintern, and a member of the Executive Committee and Presidium of the Comintern, returned home from the Soviet Union. He argued that the emphasis on independence and autonomy and democracy and the people's livelihood at the Luochuan Conference was erroneous and opposed the principle of independence and autonomy in the party's united front, emphasizing the need for "everything to go through the united front" and "everything to obey the united front," and put forward a comparatively systematic right-leaning erroneous proposition. Wang Ming's erroneous propositions had a certain impact within the party, which prevented the full implementation of the principle of independence and autonomy in the anti-Japanese national united front and caused certain damage to the party's work. The CPC Central Committee, represented by Mao Zedong, fought the necessary struggle against Wang Ming's right-leaning errors, preventing his erroneous propositions from becoming resolutions. The party central committee and Mao Zedong continued to adhere to the principle of independence and autonomy in the united front in their practical leadership work, leading the party's various work to continuously advance. From late September to early November 1938, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 6th CPC Central Committee was held in Yan'an.The conference passed the Political Resolution of the Expanded Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and approved the line of the Central Political Bureau, represented by Mao Zedong. The conference criticized the opportunism in the united front issue and basically overcame the right-leaning errors of Wang Ming. In Mao Zedong's conclusion at the conference, he particularly emphasized and elaborated on the issue of independence and autonomy in the united front. He pointed out, "In short, we must not break the united front, but we must not bind ourselves." "Our policy is independence and autonomy within the united front, both unified and independent." The political resolution passed at the plenary session also emphasized that "the independence of the Communist Party itself in political and organizational terms should be guaranteed." In this way, the principle of independence and autonomy in the anti-Japanese national united front was firmly established throughout the party.
II. Establishing the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front is a broad alliance based on cooperation between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Regarding the issue of the composition of the anti-Japanese national united front, Mao Zedong pointed out, "The party's task is to bring together the activities of the Red Army and the activities of workers, peasants, students, petite bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie to form a unified national revolutionary front." To achieve this task, in the specific circumstances of the Anti-Japanese War, it is necessary to carry out extensive work in establishing the upper-level united front.
First, the party will strive to unite patriotic leaders of various parties and groups as a breakthrough in the work of the upper-level united front. Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, wrote letters to Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Naiqi, Song Qingling, and Cai Yuanpei, expressing enthusiastic support for their anti-Japanese patriotic proposals and activities, and publicizing the political propositions of the Communist Party of China for anti-Japanese national salvation. This received positive responses from patriotic democrats. Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Song Qingling all wrote letters to the Party Central Committee expressing their support for the CPC's call for unity in the anti-Japanese cause. Fang Zhenwu, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingjue, Tao Xingzhi, and others published articles or speeches in the "Jiuguo Times" expressing their support for the policy of establishing the anti-Japanese national united front. The Chinese People's Liberation Action Committee led by Zhang Bojun, in particular, openly proclaimed on two occasions its declaration to organize an anti-Japanese front, responding to the call of the Communist Party of China to establish an anti-Japanese united front. These facts show that the work of the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong, in uniting and reaching out to the national bourgeoisie and the upper petite bourgeoisie has been effective.
Second, winning the participation of local power factions in the anti-Japanese national united front is the central link in the work of the upper-level united front. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other central leaders actively carried out united front work through letters, public speeches, and other means to engage Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng in Shaanxi, Yan Xishan in Shanxi, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi in Guangdong and Guangxi, Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan, Long Yun in Yunnan, Feng Yuxiang, Song Zheyuan, and Fu Zuoyi in North China. Special efforts were made to win over Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army and Yang Hucheng's 17th Route Army. In November 1935, Mao Zedong wrote a letter to the commander of the 57th Army of the Northeast Army, Dong Yingbin, explaining the CPC's policy of establishing a united front against Japan. The central government also established a Northeast Army Working Committee, with Zhou Enlai as its director. On January 25, 1936, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and others, in the name of Red Army leaders, issued a letter to the soldiers of the Northeast Army, pointing out that the enemies of the Northeast Army were Japanese imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and that the only way out for the Northeast Army was to resist Japan and oppose Chiang Kai-shek. They also explicitly stated that the Red Army was willing to join forces with the Northeast Army in the fight against Japan, and hoped that representatives of both sides could engage in joint consultations. Through the efforts of our party, the majority of officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army first accepted the call for joint resistance against Japan. Through negotiations between Zhou Enlai, Li Kenong, and Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Xueliang embarked on the path of cooperation with the Communist Party of China in resisting Japan.At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China considered Yang Hucheng's good relationship with the Chinese Communist Party during the Great Revolution and afterwards. They sent Wang Feng with Mao Zedong's personal letter to meet Yang Hucheng, and also sent Party cadres like Wang Bingnan to work with the 17th Route Army to quickly persuade Yang Hucheng to sign an agreement with the Red Army to stop the civil war and jointly resist the Japanese. In this way, the Communist Party of China's policy of forming a united front against Japan achieved a major victory first in the Northwestern region.
Thirdly, efforts were made to work on the Kuomintang group led by Chiang Kai-shek. In the winter of 1935, the Communist Party of China sent representatives to Nanjing to initiate initial negotiations with the Nationalist Party to establish a united front against Japan. The negotiations were first proposed by the Nationalist Party, and representatives from both sides conducted them under extremely secretive conditions. The main issues discussed in the negotiations included the cessation of the civil war, the establishment of a national defense government, and the issue of a united anti-Japanese army. Other issues included the reorganization of the Red Army, the problem of guerrilla forces in the south, the opening of anti-Japanese public opinion, the release of political prisoners, and the suspension of land reform. Due to the lack of sincerity from the Chiang Kai-shek group, the negotiations dragged on until the Xi'an Incident without reaching any specific agreement. However, the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong, made great efforts to achieve the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to jointly resist Japan. On April 25, 1936, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued the "Declaration for the Establishment of a National Anti-Japanese People's Front by All Parties and Groups," which openly included the Nationalist Party in the united front for the first time. On May 5, when the Red Army's eastern expedition against Japan was heavily obstructed by the Nationalist Party, it decided to retreat and issued the "Ceasefire Proposal and Consensus Anti-Japanese Telegraph," abandoning the slogan of "anti-Chiang." On August 12, in the document "Regarding Future Strategic Plans," the Party Central Committee for the first time identified Nanjing as the "necessary and main opponent" in the united front and raised the question of "requesting Jiang to resist Japan." On August 25, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Letter from the Communist Party of China to the Nationalist Party," formally proposing that the Communist Party of China was willing to "form a strong revolutionary united front" with the Nationalist Party. On September 1, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the directive "Regarding the Pressure on Jiang to Resist Japan," from which the Communist Party's policy officially changed from "anti-Chiang, anti-Japanese" to "pressuring Jiang to resist Japan." The Party Central Committee firmly grasped the theme of the national contradiction between China and Japan and decisively adjusted and transformed the Party's policies. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The changes in the national situation and policies of the masses and the Communist Party were brought about by our party's steps such as the August 1935 declaration, the December decision, the May 5th abandonment of the 'anti-Chiang' slogan, the August letter to the Nationalist Party, the September resolution for a democratic republic, and the December insistence on a peaceful solution to the Xi'an Incident, as well as the February letter to the Nationalist Party's Third Plenary Session, etc." After the shocking "Xi'an Incident" occurred, a complex and tense situation suddenly emerged nationwide. The Party Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, with outstanding political foresight and based on the interests of the Chinese nation, formulated the policy of peacefully resolving the Xi'an Incident. After the efforts of the Communist Party delegation led by Zhou Enlai, Chiang Kai-shek was finally forced to agree to six conditions, including the cessation of the civil war and the formation of a joint red army to resist Japan. Since then, the ten-year civil war has basically ended, laying the foundation for the formation of the united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for resistance against Japan.
III. The overall exposition of the strategic policy guidelines and basic policies of the united front against Japan
In the struggle to uphold the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and oppose the "die-hard faction" of the Nationalist Party, the strategic policy guidelines and basic policies of the united front against Japan were fully expounded.
The Communist Party of China correctly addressed the following basic issues in its strategic thinking on the united front against Japan: correctly handling the relationship between national and class struggles within the national united front.
Mao Zedong firmly grasped the main contradiction between China and Japan and made a specific analysis of the particularity of the contradictions within the national united front.He wrote, "First, analyze the characteristics of war, and analyze the characteristics of the United Front - the contradiction between China and Japan and the domestic contradiction." He based his strategy on studying the regularity and characteristics of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. In the Anti-Japanese struggle, there is both a national struggle and a domestic class struggle. In general, it is a national struggle, and the class struggle should be subordinate to the national struggle against Japan. This is the fundamental principle of the Anti-Japanese United Front. He emphasized the consistency of the two and pointed out: "In the national struggle, the class struggle appears in the form of the national struggle. This form demonstrates the consistency of the two. On the one hand, the political and economic demands of class require cooperation without rupture within a certain historical period; on the other hand, all demands of class struggle should be based on the needs of the national struggle (for the sake of resisting Japan). In this way, the unity and independence of the united front, the relationship between national struggle and class struggle, and the relationship between anti-Japanese and democracy are all brought together, striving for democracy for the sake of resisting Japan, the government granting the necessary democracy and political freedom to the people, especially the freedom to organize, train, and arm themselves for self-defense. Only then can comprehensive resistance against Japan be achieved. However, there is also appropriate class struggle in the national struggle, such as maintaining the independence of parties and classes, adhering to a certain degree of rights for parties and classes, freedom of criticism, improving the political and economic conditions of the people, etc. These are the struggles that the Communist Party of China and the masses led by it should preserve for the sake of uniting in the resistance against Japan. In the anti-Japanese struggle, what should and should be stopped are the struggles that are unfavorable to the unity in the resistance against Japan, such as domestic warfare, partisan hostility, local separatism, as well as on the one hand, feudal political and economic oppression, and on the other hand, uprising policies and excessively high economic demands that are unfavorable to the resistance against Japan. Based on this, the Central Committee of the Party put forward: first, we must differentiate between the two-faced landlords and big capitalists who advocate resisting Japan but are wavering and those who advocate unity but are anti-communist. When the Kuomintang launched the first anti-communist wave, what attitude the national bourgeoisie held, whether there was any difference between them and the big capitalists, has not yet been verified. After the first anti-communist wave, it was proved that the attitude of the national bourgeoisie was indeed different from that of the big landlords and big capitalists. Therefore, Mao Zedong made important modifications to the article "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party". He wrote that the national bourgeoisie "not only differs from the capitulationists of the big landlords and big capitalists, but also differs from the stubborn faction of the big capitalists. They are still our better allies. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to adopt a cautious policy towards the national bourgeoisie." 
Secondly, we must differentiate between the pro-Japanese faction of the big capitalists who are against resisting Japan and the pro-British and American faction of the big landlords and big capitalists who advocate resisting Japan. The pro-Japanese faction of the big capitalists (the capitulationists) have already surrendered or are ready to surrender. The pro-British and American faction of the big capitalists (the stubborn faction), although still in the ranks of resistance against Japan, is also very wavering. They are two-faced individuals who are both against Japan and against communism at the same time. For the policy towards the capitulationists of the big capitalists, we must treat them as enemies and resolutely overthrow them. As for the stubborn faction of the big capitalists, we should use the two-sided policy of revolution in dealing with them, namely, on the one hand, unite with them because they are still in the resistance against Japan, and we should use their contradictions with Japanese imperialism. On the other hand, we should engage in decisive struggles with them because they are implementing a high-pressure policy that undermines the resistance against Japan and the unity against communism and the people. Without struggle, it will be harmful to resistance against Japan and unity." 
Thirdly, we must differentiate between the various factions within the Kuomintang, which is mainly composed of the pro-British and American faction of big capitalists. The Kuomintang is a party composed of complex elements, including the stubborn faction, the middle faction, and the progressive faction. Due to their different positions, interests, various relationships, and historical circumstances, their attitudes towards resistance against Japan and cooperation with the Communists are also different and change according to time and place.Therefore, we should also make distinctions among them. In a report on July 6, 1940, Mao Zedong pointed out at a cadre meeting that in the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), only a small minority are actually die-hard conservatives. On April 12 of the same year, the Central Secretariat and the Military Commission also stated that among the officers at all levels of the central army, only a portion of them, as well as the political training system, are die-hard conservatives, while the majority are moderates and there are also some progressives. We cannot regard the central army as entirely composed of die-hard conservatives. On November 16 of the same year, Mao Zedong, Wang Jiaxiang, Zhu De, and other central leaders once again pointed out that it was wrong and harmful to perceive the Huangpu graduates as a general anti-communist group. In the current serious situation, it is urgent to correct this perception and to use every opportunity to conduct united front work with Huangpu military personnel, without provoking them, but rather by appealing to their sense of nationalism. On April 23, 1941, the Central Military Commission issued the "Directive on Distinguishing and Treating Various Types of Kuomintang Forces in a Differentiated Manner to Obtain the Support of the Majority," in which the Kuomintang forces were divided into four categories: those who had already colluded with the Japanese invaders and were staunchly anti-communist (the hidden Hanjian forces); those who had not yet colluded with the Japanese invaders, but were also staunchly anti-communist (the true die-hard conservatives); those who temporarily maintained neutrality during the anti-communist struggle and had sympathy towards our side. It was pointed out that our policy is: unite with sympathizers, strive to win over the neutrals, weaken the staunch conservatives, eliminate the hidden Hanjian forces, in order to obtain the support of the majority, and persist in the resistance war until the end.
Finally, we must distinguish between the two-faced individuals who are among the collaborators and pro-Japanese elements, and the staunch Hanjian figures such as Wang Jingwei, Wang Yitang, and Shi You. Mao Zedong pointed out, "Even among the pro-Japanese elements, there are also two-faced individuals, and we should adopt a revolutionary policy towards them. We should adopt a policy to strike and isolate the pro-Japanese aspect, and a policy to woo and win over the vacillating aspect. We should distinguish between these two-faced individuals and the staunch Hanjian figures like Wang Jingwei, Wang Yitang, and Shi You." Combining unity and struggle, through struggle to achieve unity, Mao Zedong said when discussing the policy of the national united front in the resistance against Japan, "The current policy of the national united front against Japan is neither about entirely uniting while denying struggle, nor about entirely struggling while denying unity. It is a policy that combines unity and struggle. To unite and struggle is a basic strategic principle of the Chinese Communist Party towards the bourgeoisie, and it is also the overall policy of the anti-Japanese national united front. This overall policy is the very valuable experience derived from the twists and turns of successes and failures that our party has gone through. Our party's progress and retreat, the success and failure of the revolution, are closely connected to this policy."
Unity and struggle within the anti-Japanese national united front are dialectical relations: they are relative, not absolute. Mao Zedong said in a speech at the Politburo Meeting of the Communist Party of China on September 24, 1938: in the united front, unity is the fundamental principle that must be implemented in all localities and in all work, at all times and in all places. We must not forget unity, but we must also assist it with the principle of struggle, because struggle is precisely for the sake of unity. Without struggle, the development and consolidation of the united front cannot be achieved. Suitable and necessary struggle is required. In his "Outline for Resisting Surrender" he further stated, "Unity must not forget struggle, and struggle must not forget unity. Both cannot be neglected, but unity should be the main focus, 'grinding without splitting'." Mao Zedong summarized the relationship between unity (unification, solidarity) and struggle in one sentence: "Struggle is the means of unity, and unity is the purpose of struggle. Seeking unity through struggle leads to unity, seeking unity through concessions leads to the demise of unity." In July 1940, Mao Zedong also made the following summary in his conclusion on the discussion meeting of senior cadres in Yan'an: ① We have always emphasized unity, and we will continue to do so in the future - towards all anti-Japanese factions. ② We have always emphasized struggle, and we will continue to do so in the future - towards all surrender factions. ③ We emphasize both unity and struggle - towards all factions that both resist Japan and oppose communism.Sometimes emphasis is placed on unity, sometimes on struggle - depending on the stubborn faction's attitude of whether unity or anti-communism is primary. Struggle is for the sake of unity - to extend the period of cooperation. Regardless of the aspect (political, military, cultural), unity is currently the primary focus, but at the same time, there is also struggle in all aspects. This is because the Kuomintang's stubborn anti-communist policy has not changed. Correctly handling the relationship between unity and struggle is a very complex and difficult issue to grasp. Whether one can correctly handle the relationship between the two becomes a dividing line between the CCP's correct and incorrect policies throughout history.
During the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, as the CCP had grown from a young party to a mature one in terms of thinking and politics, and as the CCP had mastered the leadership art of Marxism. Not only did they conduct a profound analysis of the national bourgeoisie, especially the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and formulate a strategy of both unity and struggle, but they also successfully implemented this strategy in practice. In the united front against Japan, the CCP adopted a strategy of both unity and struggle towards the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. By doing so, on one hand, they defended against the attacks of the stubborn faction, protected the progressive forces from losses, and allowed the progressive forces to continue their development; on the other hand, they extended their time in the resistance against Japan, maintained their cooperation with them, and avoided the occurrence of large-scale civil war. Therefore, Mao Zedong said, "Without struggle, the progressive forces will be annihilated by the stubborn forces, the united front cannot exist, the surrender of the stubborn faction will encounter no resistance, and civil war will break out." The main reason why the anti-Japanese national united front was able to persist until the victory of the war was primarily due to the CCP's adherence to the overall policy of both unity and struggle within the united front. Developing progressive forces, winning over the middle forces, and isolating the stubborn forces are inevitably the coalition of several classes or political groups. Because the interests and positions of the various classes and political groups that participate in the united front are different, they will inevitably be divided into left, center, and right forces. Mao Zedong said, "The basic condition for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan is the expansion and consolidation of the anti-Japanese united front. To achieve this goal, we must adopt the strategy of developing progressive forces, winning over middle forces, and opposing stubborn forces. These are inseparable three links, and struggle is the means to achieve unity of all anti-Japanese forces." Developing progressive forces, winning over middle forces, and isolating stubborn forces are not only a basic strategy and policy of the CCP within the anti-Japanese national united front but also the political line during the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
Firstly, developing progressive forces. At this time, it is necessary to develop the following seven forces: developing the forces of the proletariat, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie; expanding the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army; widely establishing anti-Japanese base areas; developing the organization of the Communist Party to the whole country; developing nationwide movement of workers, peasants, youth, women, children, etc.; winning over the intellectuals of the whole nation; and expanding the movement to seek democracy and constitutionalism to the masses. This is the central and fundamental link among the three strategic principles."Only by step by step developing progressive forces can we prevent the situation from reversing, prevent surrender and division, and establish a solid foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan."
Next, strive for the middle forces. "It should be known that Chinese society is a society with a small number of elites at both ends and a large number of middle class people. If the Communist Party cannot win the support of the middle class and cater to their needs, it will not be able to solve China's problems." In China, the middle forces have significant power and can often become the decisive factor in our fight against stubborn factions. Therefore, we must approach them with extreme caution. The characteristic of the middle forces is that they are politically unsteady, so under certain conditions, it is possible for us to win them over to our side. Specifically, winning over the middle forces means targeting the following seven categories of people: the national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentlemen, miscellaneous troops, moderates within the Kuomintang (referring to factions and individuals within the Kuomintang who were not actively anti-Communist or took a neutral stance for a certain period), moderates within the Central Army (although the Central Army is Chiang Kai-shek's main force, there are some armies or individual units that were not actively anti-Communist or took a neutral stance during the anti-Japanese period), the upper petty bourgeoisie, and various small parties. Our party has conducted extensive efforts to win over these seven categories of people during the anti-Japanese war, and achieved significant results. Not only did they join us in the fight against Japan, but they also joined us in the struggle for democracy.
Finally, isolate the stubborn forces. The stubborn faction refers to the pro-Japanese faction of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, namely the Chiang Kai-shek group of the Kuomintang. During the anti-Japanese war, they adopted a two-faced policy: advocating resistance against Japan on one hand, while implementing extremely reactionary policies to suppress progressive forces on the other. Isolating the stubborn forces means using a dual policy of revolution to counter the dual policy of the stubborn faction: on one hand, we strive to keep them within the anti-Japanese united front for as long as possible; on the other hand, we engage in resolute struggle against their passive resistance to the war and active anti-Communist policies. This is a policy of seeking unity through struggle, combining cooperation and struggle, and adopting the strategy of hitting and pulling in order to dismantle their resistance.
How should we engage in the struggle against the stubborn faction? Mao Zedong proposed the principles of being justified, advantageous, and prudent. The principle of being justified is also known as the principle of self-defense, meaning that we do not initiate aggression, but if someone attacks us, we will retaliate. The principle of being advantageous is also known as the principle of victory, meaning that we do not engage in unnecessary battles, but if we do fight, we must be confident of winning and have a solid plan. The principle of being prudent is also known as the principle of temporary truce, meaning that we stop fighting when appropriate. The successful application of these three principles achieves the goal of isolating the stubborn faction. By utilizing contradictions, winning over the majority, and opposing the minority, we can deal with each faction individually and defeat them one by one.
Among various imperialist countries, different exploiting classes, groups, and factions will inevitably collude and conspire against the people for the purpose of exploitation and oppression. On one hand, they are united; on the other hand, due to their different interests, they compete and generate contradictions, especially with the changing revolutionary situation and the increasingly powerful people's revolutionary forces, these contradictions among them will become more acute. The contradictions and their continuous expansion within the exploiting classes are advantageous to the revolutionary struggle led by the proletariat. Mao Zedong proposed in the book "On the Strategy Against Japanese Imperialism" that "We must collect all the fights, gaps, and contradictions within the enemy's camp and use them against the main enemy of the current situation." Later, this strategy was summarized as the sixteen-character strategy of "utilizing contradictions, winning over the majority, opposing the minority, and defeating them individually." The leaders of the Communist Party of China successfully applied this strategy. Firstly, the establishment of the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the formation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front were the successful utilization of the contradictions between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the pro-American and pro-British factions against Japanese imperialism.
In 1956, Mao Zedong introduced the experience of the successful democratic revolution in China to foreign friends, stating, "In the past, China's comprador bourgeoisie were pro-British, pro-American, and pro-Japanese. During the War of Resistance against Japan, we utilized the contradictions between Britain, America, and Japan, first by fighting against the Japanese aggressors and their comprador groups. Then, we opposed the invading forces of America and Britain, overthrowing the pro-American and pro-British comprador groups." Secondly, the Communist Party of China (CPC) made use of the contradictions between local powerful factions and the Chiang Kai-shek group, gaining the support of these local factions and isolating the Chiang Kai-shek group, forcing them to cooperate with our party and fight against Japan. Thirdly, during the struggle against the Kuomintang's surrender and anti-communist activities, the CPC fully utilized the contradictions among different groups and factions within the Kuomintang, gaining the support of the majority and isolating the minority, thus achieving victory in the struggle. During the War of Resistance against Japan, in many places, the revolutionary forces faced disadvantages compared to the Kuomintang. The CPC was able to achieve victory in the struggle against stubborn resistance due to its political advantages and proper strategic use. Finally, our party also utilized the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, uniting the national bourgeoisie and isolating the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.
Section 3: The Ideology and Policies of the People's Democratic United Front
I. The Introduction of the Concept of the "People's Democratic United Front"
The period of the Liberation War was the final decisive stage of the Chinese democratic revolution and one of the most magnificent chapters in the history of Chinese revolution. The united front of the Chinese revolution formed against the backdrop of two different destinies and future prospects, has its own characteristics. It is based on the common political foundation of striving for people's democracy and achieving domestic peace. Its policies are entirely determined and implemented independently by the CPC. It has a complete organizational form, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and so on. However, the most prominent characteristic of the united front during the Liberation War was its unprecedented scale and deep-rooted foundation. Mao Zedong repeatedly mentioned the vast scale and profound foundation of the united front during the Liberation War. In February 1947, when drafting an internal instruction for the CPC Central Committee, he said, "This is an extremely broad nationwide united front. Compared with the united front during the War of Resistance against Japan, it is not only equally vast in scale but also has a deeper foundation." It has been mentioned here that the foundation of the united front is even deeper than that during the period of the War of Resistance. At the end of 1947, based on the development of the united front practice, Mao Zedong drew a new conclusion and further pointed out, "Our new democratic revolutionary united front is now larger and more consolidated than ever before." He explained particularly, "At first glance, compared with the period of the War of Resistance against Japan, our revolutionary national united front seems to have narrowed. But in reality, only now, after Chiang Kai-shek has betrayed the national interests to American imperialism and initiated a nationwide civil war against the people, and only now after the evil deeds of American imperialism and the reactionary ruling group led by Chiang Kai-shek have been fully exposed to the Chinese people, has our national united front truly expanded." Here, Mao Zedong explicitly affirmed that the scale and deep-rooted foundation of the united front during the Liberation War surpassed any previous period, especially the united front of the War of Resistance against Japan, the only one that can be compared in terms of scale, scope, and influence.
The concept of the "People's Democratic United Front" appeared in the later stage of the Liberation War. The democratic figure Zhu Xuefan was the first to put forward the term "People's Democratic United Front".In January 1948, Zhu Xuefan, the chairman of the China Labour Association in London, accepted an invitation from the Communist Party of China (CPC) and, before leaving for the liberated areas in China, issued a declaration to workers around the world. In the declaration, it stated that the association fully accepted the positions of the CPC, supported the democratic revolution movement, supported the implementation of land reform, supported all political forces fighting for democracy, and formed a united front of people's democracy. On July 1, 1949, the CPC Central Committee issued a slogan commemorating the 12th anniversary of the "7-7" Anti-Japanese War, which called for the "consolidation of the united front of people's democracy." This was the initial formulation of the concept of the "united front of people's democracy" by the Communist Party of China.
II.It systematically elucidated the main targets of revolution in the new situation. 
The Communist Party of China's successful united front policy has promoted the formation of its own distinctive ideology and strategy for the united front of people's democracy.
In order to further clarify the direction of the struggle for the whole party and the people of the country, Mao Zedong more clearly defined opposing bureaucratic capitalism as one of the three major tasks of the new democratic revolution, alongside opposing imperialism and feudalism in April 1947. In December 1947, Mao Zedong, in his report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," analyzed the economic reality of the bureaucratic monopoly bourgeoisie accumulating social wealth and monopolizing the national economy. He pointed out, "This monopoly capital, combined with state power, becomes state monopoly capitalism. This state monopoly capitalism is closely linked with foreign imperialism, the domestic landlord class, and the old rich peasants, becoming a comprador feudal state monopoly capitalism. This is the economic foundation of the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the tasks of the new democratic revolution are to "eliminate not only the privileges of imperialism in China but also the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie (big bourgeoisie) and change the comprador feudal production relations, liberating the fettered productive forces." As the bureaucratic monopoly bourgeoisie holds control over the national economy through massive state enterprises and possesses vast social wealth, "it has prepared sufficient material conditions for the new democratic revolution." Mao Zedong explicitly stated that the "monopoly capital led by Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu should be confiscated and become the property of the new democratic state," along with "the land of the feudal class should be confiscated and become the property of the farmers" and "national industry and commerce should be protected," as the three major economic principles of the new democratic revolution. This is Mao Zedong's further development of the tasks and principles of the new democratic revolution in the new political and economic context after the victory of the war of resistance against Japan.
During the war of resistance against Japan, Mao Zedong pointed out, "The big bourgeoisie with comprador characteristics has never been the driving force of the Chinese revolution, but the object of the Chinese revolution." However, during the war of resistance, our party did not directly put forward the slogan of confiscating bureaucratic capital and eliminating the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. The first reason for this was that the bureaucratic bourgeoisie was still in the anti-Japanese camp at that time, and we needed to adopt a united front strategy of both cooperation and struggle with them in order to focus on dealing with the main enemy, Japanese imperialism. Therefore, confiscating bureaucratic capital and eliminating the bureaucratic bourgeoisie were not possible and should not have been the action program of that period. Secondly, the monopoly groups of big bankers and big compradors gradually formed before the war of resistance, and during the war of resistance, they were in a stage of expanding their monopoly power from the financial sector to other economic sectors and accelerating the concentration of capital. After the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, bureaucratic capital developed to its peak, bringing unprecedented disasters to the Chinese people, and its feudal, comprador, military, and reactionary nature in terms of national monopoly became evident to the people. As Mao Zedong pointed out, "On the basis of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, American monopoly capital and Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic comprador capital are closely linked, controlling the country's economic life. The result is extreme inflation, unprecedented price increases, the increasing bankruptcy of national industry and commerce, and the deteriorating living conditions of the laboring masses and public employees."In this situation, forcing people from all walks of life to unite and fight for their survival. "In short, the process of the emergence, development, and decline of bureaucratic capital and its reactionary nature has a gradually exposed process, and the Chinese people's understanding and struggle against it also have a gradually developing process. After the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched a strategic offensive in 1947, the Communist Party of China timely put forward the slogan of confiscating the bureaucratic capital of the four major families, which naturally received the wholehearted support of the broadest masses of the people nationwide.
Mao Zedong pointed out incisively: "The revolution led by the proletariat, supported by the masses, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, is the new democratic revolution in China, and it is the general line and general policy of the Communist Party of China in the current stage of history." In view of the fact that the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are concentrated representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary ruling group, Mao Zedong clearly put forward the political slogan of "overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the whole of China." This slogan concentrated the entire revolutionary program of the Communist Party of China at that time, pointed out the clear goals and political direction for the entire Party, Army, and the people of the country, had extremely significant significance for isolating a small number of enemies to the greatest extent, uniting the vast majority of the people, and especially winning over the moderate masses.
At different stages of revolutionary development, Mao Zedong has always paid attention to the changes in the objective situation, correctly pointing out the main enemies of the revolution in order to formulate corresponding specific programs and policies. On this basis, Mao Zedong has always attached importance to the use of contradictions among various factions within the reactionary ruling group, to divide and disintegrate the enemy, emphasizing "collecting all struggles, gaps, and contradictions within the enemy's camp as means to fight against the current main enemy." At the beginning of the Liberation War, Mao Zedong pointed out: In order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, "in the Nationalist Party's army, we should win over all possible people who are opposed to civil war and isolate the warmongers." "On the one hand, our army should carry out open and extensive political propaganda and political offensive against the Nationalist Party's civil war forces in order to disintegrate their will to fight. On the other hand, we must prepare and organize uprisings within the Nationalist Party's army and launch the Gao Shuxun movement, so that a large number of Nationalist Party's army will follow the example of Gao Shuxun and stand on the side of the people in the critical moment of the war." For this reason, the Party Central Committee set up special departments and dispatched dedicated cadres to carry out work on dividing the enemy's army. After the People's Liberation Army launched a strategic offensive, Chiang Kai-shek's continuous military failures caused a profound crisis within the enemy camp. The contradictions between various factions within the Kuomintang, and between Chiang Kai-shek's regular army and local military groups, became increasingly sharp. Based on this, the Central Committee of the Party further pointed out: "In the use of contradictions within the enemy, when they are still within the reactionary ruling group as an opposition and local power against Chiang, we can only regard them as indirect allied forces; but when they have already changed their position, support our party's action program, and openly oppose the American and Chiang, we must adopt a welcoming attitude and encourage them to transform themselves in action, proving themselves as direct allied forces." Under this correct policy, our party has done a lot of patient and meticulous work to win over the anti-Chiang factions within the Kuomintang, and accelerate the division of the enemy camp. Under the influence of the Communist Party of China, the various anti-Chiang factions within the Kuomintang formed the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in January 1948, led by Li Jishen, Feng Yuxiang, and others, openly declaring their participation in the struggle to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime. At the same time, with the advantageous conditions of the Kuomintang's defeat and the rapid expansion of all contradictions within the enemy camp, the People's Liberation Army implemented a policy of closely combining military strikes with political persuasion, launching a strong political offensive on various battlefields.This not only prompted many Kuomintang soldiers to reorganize or defect, but also persuaded General Fu Zuoyi, who was entrusted by Chiang Kai-shek with the responsibility of commanding over 600,000 troops, to accept peaceful reformation. In the great march of my million-strong army crossing the Yangtze River and advancing directly towards Nanjing, even the chief representative of the negotiating delegation sent by the Kuomintang government, Zhang Zhizhong, was won over to the side of the people's revolution and joined the ranks of the People's Democratic United Front.
III. The strategy and thinking for consolidating and expanding the alliance between the working class and the peasantry
The feudal landlord class has always been one of the main targets of the Chinese democratic revolution. During the Anti-Japanese War, our party actively changed the policy of confiscating land from landlords after 1927 to a policy of reducing rent and interest, in order to win the participation of landlords in the resistance against Japan. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the contradictions between the peasantry and the feudal landlord class became increasingly acute as the contradictions between the Chinese and Japanese nationalities eased. In the liberated areas of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Central China, there were extensive mass movements in which land was directly taken from landlords and redistributed to the tillers, in struggles such as anti-espionage, liquidation, rent reduction, and interest reduction. Some traitors, bullies, and landlord elements fled to the cities and vehemently criticized the peasant movement in the liberated areas. Under the influence of reactionary elements, some intermediaries expressed doubts about the peasant struggles; within the party, a few individuals also felt that the peasant movement had "gone too far." In response to these situations, Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi explicitly pointed out at that time: "Now, as in the period of the Great Revolution, when the peasants reach out their hands for land, the Communist Party must have a firm and clear attitude on whether or not to approve it." "At present, the Kuomintang controls the big cities, has the help of imperialism, and occupies three-quarters of the population. We can only rely on the great power of the broad popular masses to fight against it in order to change this situation where he is big and we are small. If the land problem is solved within the liberated areas with a population of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, it will enable the people in the liberated areas to continue supporting the struggle without feeling tired." "This is a fundamental question, the basic link of all work, which requires that all party cadres recognize its importance." For this reason, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions on the Land Question" on May 4, 1946 (hereinafter referred to as the "May Fourth Instructions"), which required local party committees to "resolutely support all legitimate demands and just actions of the peasants, and approve the land that the peasants have already obtained and are currently obtaining. It should refute the curses of traitors, gentry, and landlords and explain the doubts of the middle class. It should provide education for incorrect views within the party." Since then, the policy of rent and interest reduction implemented by our party during the Anti-Japanese War has been changed to the policy of confiscating land from the landlord class and distributing it to the peasants, and land reform movements have been launched in various liberated areas. However, given that comprehensive civil war had not yet erupted and the door to negotiations had not yet been completely closed, the "May Fourth Instructions" also stated that consideration should be given to the interests of the rich peasants and certain landlords, such as stipulating that "the land of rich peasants should generally not be redistributed" and "some land should be left for landlords who have made contributions to the resistance against Japan," and so on. The purpose of these provisions was to win them over, as well as people from various sectors who are connected to them, to jointly oppose the authoritarian policies of Chiang Kai-shek's government in the civil war.
After the outbreak of the comprehensive civil war, Chiang Kai-shek launched a massive attack on the liberated areas, which boosted the reactionary spirit of the landlord class, as they hoped for the victory of the Chiang Kai-shek government. Landlords and bullies who fled to Chiang-controlled areas organized "Returning Home Teams" and attacked the liberated areas along with Chiang's army, brutally countering the broad rural population and stubbornly opposing the land reform movement led by our party. At the same time, the rich peasants also showed hostility towards land reform. In essence, one of the main purposes of Chiang Kai-shek's clique in launching the counterrevolutionary civil war was to preserve the feudal land system and the feudal privileges of the landlord class, in order to maintain the economic foundation of its reactionary rule. Based on this, our party convened the National Land Conference from July to September 1947 and formulated the "Outline of Chinese Land Law".On October 10th, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) released this outline, it solemnly pointed out, "China's land system is extremely unreasonable. In general, less than 10% of the rural population, consisting of landlords and wealthy peasants, own about 70% to 80% of the land and cruelly exploit the farmers. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the rural population, including hired laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other people, only have about 20% to 30% of the land to support their livelihood through year-round labor. This severe situation is the root cause of our nation's invasion, oppression, poverty, and backwardness. It is also the basic obstacle to our national democracy, industrialization, independence, unity, and prosperity." In order to change this serious situation, the "General Outline of China's Land Law" (hereinafter referred to as the "Outline") developed the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement and explicitly declared, "Abolish the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system and implement the land system where the cultivator owns the land." The "Outline" explicitly stipulates the policy of confiscating all land and property of the landlords and expropriating the excess land and property of the wealthy peasants, and proposes specific methods for distributing land by taking more from those with an abundance and giving less to those with a scarcity, based on the average population in rural areas. In accordance with the provisions of the "General Outline of China's Land Law," a land reform movement that thoroughly destroys the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative system and eliminates the landlord class is being launched on an unprecedented scale in various liberated areas.
Since the release of the "May Fourth Directive" by the Central Committee, land reform movements in various liberated areas have shown a right-leaning tendency in some regions due to a greater consideration for wealthy peasants and certain landlords. In some areas, there were occurrences of not daring to mobilize the masses and not making efforts to meet the land demands of poor peasants. After the National Land Conference formulated a comprehensive land policy, the liberated areas overcame the above-mentioned right-leaning tendency and vigorously promoted the land reform. However, some "leftist" phenomena also occurred, such as some places not grasping the correct criteria for class identification, wrongly classifying some individuals as landlords or wealthy peasants, resulting in unclear lines between the enemy and us. In some places, interests of middle peasants were violated, and national industry and commerce were undermined. Some places excessively emphasized the confiscation of land and property from the wealthy peasants, treating them the same as landlords and even adopting the method of driving them out without providing them with a means of livelihood, leading to disorder and violence. Regarding this, the Party Central Committee, with Mao Zedong at the helm, attached great importance to it. Around the end of November 1947, before and after the December meeting of the Party Central Committee, Mao Zedong further elucidated the basic principles of land reform and a series of specific policies, firmly rectifying the aforementioned "leftist" errors. At the end of November 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reissued the two documents written by Mao Zedong in 1933, "How to Divide the Rural Class" and "Decisions on Some Issues in the Land Struggle," as the standards for class division and the basis for implementing policies. The issuance and implementation of these two documents corrected the tendency of implementing "leftist" policies in land reform by wrongly categorizing some people as landlords or wealthy peasants. At the December meeting of the Party Central Committee, Mao Zedong pointed out, "To carry out land reform resolutely and thoroughly in the countryside, we must not only organize a mass agricultural association, including hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants, but also must first organize a poor peasant association, representing the interests of the poor peasants through its elected committee, as the legitimate authority to implement land reform. The poor peasant association should become the leading core of all rural struggles. Our policy is to rely on the poor peasants, unite with middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal systems of exploitation by the landlord class and the old-fashioned wealthy peasants. The land and property that the landlords and wealthy peasants should receive should not exceed that of the peasant masses. However, the so-called 'landlords have no land, wealthy peasants receive inferior land' policy that was implemented from 1931 to 1934, which was a 'leftist' error, should not be repeated."
In order to ensure that over 90% of the rural population participate in the united front of land reform, Mao Zedong pointed out that two basic principles must be observed: "First, the demands of the poor and landless peasants must be met, which is the most fundamental task of land reform. Second, the middle peasants must be firmly united without harming their interests." In order to accomplish the strategic task of consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants, Mao Zedong made specific provisions regarding the middle peasant policy: during the process of confiscating feudal class land and evenly distributing land, the opinions of the middle peasants must be respected and certain needs of the middle peasants must be taken into account (such as allowing some middle peasants to possess a higher amount of land than the average level of land obtained by general poor peasants). Active members of the middle peasants must be incorporated into the peasant committees and rural democratic governments, and individuals with middle peasant backgrounds must not be mistakenly categorized as rich peasants. At the same time, it is necessary to fairly and reasonably burden the middle peasants with land taxes and the support of the war effort. Due to the implementation of these two basic principles, the united front of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class (through the Communist Party) has been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed, fully harnessing the role of the main force of the peasantry.
In the land reform movement, the Party Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, not only focused its main efforts on relying on poor and landless peasants and uniting with middle peasants, but also sought to win over all other classes and strata that could be won over. In order to isolate and strike at the most stubborn hostile elements of the feudal class, Mao Zedong, based on the actual situation of China's rural feudal relations, proposed policies that should differentiate between landlords and rich peasants, as well as policies that should differentiate between big, medium, and small landlords, and between despotic and non-despotic elements within the landlord and rich peasant class. He also advocated not harming the non-feudal form of exploitation of capitalist and imperialist economic and industrial enterprises by landlords and rich peasants. In the struggle to overthrow the feudal system, the Party Central Committee, particularly Mao Zedong, paid special attention to winning over the enlightened gentlemen who had separated from the feudal class. When restating the strategic principle of "winning the majority, opposing the minority, using contradictions, and disintegrating them one by one," the Central Committee emphasized: "We must understand that the majority must always include the minority of enlightened individuals in the enemies' camp (i.e. enlightened gentry and patriots within the feudal and comprador bourgeoisie class)." Mao Zedong provided a profound explanation of this: "Enlightened gentlemen are individuals within the landlord and rich peasant class who have democratic tendencies. These individuals have contradictions with bureaucratic capitalism and imperialism, as well as certain contradictions with feudal landlords and rich peasants." During the period of difficulties in the Anti-Japanese War and the post-war period, they have provided us with considerable assistance. When we implemented land reform, they did not hinder or oppose it, therefore we should still adopt a policy of unity towards them."Due to the fact that the majority of China's intellectuals come from landlord and rich peasant families, the majority of the national bourgeoisie have connections to land, and there are hundreds of thousands of enlightened gentlemen nationwide, if we unite with and educate the enlightened gentlemen who support anti-American and anti-Chiang, democracy (not anti-communist), and land reform, it will be beneficial for winning over the national intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, the enlightened gentlemen nationwide, as well as for isolating the main enemy of the Chinese revolution, the reactionary clique of Chiang Kai-shek.
Based on the above guidelines, our party has united and won over a large number of enlightened gentlemen and patriots in the land reform, causing the big landlords, despots, and bullies within the feudal class to be extremely isolated. Under the unity and education of our party, many representatives of the enlightened gentlemen gradually stood on the side of the people's revolution, participated in the struggle against the US-Chiang reactionary clique, and played a certain role in the united front of the people's democratic revolution.
In January 1948, after thorough investigation and research, Ren Bishi, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Party, delivered a speech on "Several Issues in Land Reform," correctly discussing "the criteria for dividing rural classes," "the need to unite with the middle peasants," "the methods of struggle against landlords and rich peasants," "the policy towards industry and commerce," "the issue of intellectuals and enlightened gentry," and "firmly opposing random beatings and killings." Ren Bishi's important speech further elaborated on the principles and policies of land reform proposed by Mao Zedong, playing a positive role in correcting the "left" deviation.
In summary, the Central Committee of the Party, led by Mao Zedong, drew lessons from the experience of the land revolution war period, promptly corrected the right and "left" deviations in the land reform movement since the May Fourth Movement, and formulated principles and policies for land reform that were in line with the actual rural conditions. The implementation of these policies mobilized the vast number of poor and landless peasants, consolidated the unity of the middle peasants, won over the enlightened gentry and other patriotic individuals, and expanded and strengthened the rural democratic united front against feudalism, rather than shrinking it.
As the People's Liberation Army advanced into the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the newly liberated areas quickly increased. In view of the different actual conditions in these areas, such as the fact that the remaining enemies in these areas had not been completely eliminated and the general low level of mass consciousness, which was different from the old liberated areas and semi-liberated areas, Mao Zedong proposed in February 1948 to adopt different strategies in implementing land reform in different regions. In the old liberated areas, the land issue had basically been resolved, and only a partial adjustment of land was needed, without the need for land redistribution. Instead, the focus should be on rectifying the Party's ranks and resolving contradictions between the Party and the masses. In the semi-liberated areas, the land issue had not been completely resolved and land should be distributed comprehensively and thoroughly. In the newly liberated areas, land reform should be implemented in two stages: in the first stage, the rich peasants should be treated neutrally, while the landlords, especially the big landlords, should be targeted, and their land and property should be distributed. Then, in the second stage, the excess land and property of the rich peasants should be distributed. Soon after, Mao Zedong made new regulations based on the actual situation of rural work in the newly liberated areas. He pointed out that in the rural areas of the newly liberated areas, "early distribution of wealth" was welcomed by only a few brave individuals, while the majority of the basic masses did not benefit from it and therefore expressed dissatisfaction. Moreover, the rapid dispersion of social wealth was also detrimental to the army. By distributing land too early, the burden of military supplies fell entirely on the peasants, rather than on the landlords and rich peasants. Therefore, it was necessary to first implement widespread reductions in rent and interest, as well as corresponding social and fiscal policies, so as to "prevent the dispersion of social wealth, maintain social order, and concentrate all forces to eliminate the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang." Mao Zedong's aforementioned strategy allowed the land reform movement to proceed step by step and in stages, according to the strength of feudal forces, the level of mass consciousness, and the level of organization in different types of liberated areas. This further improved the completeness of our party's land reform policy. In April 948, Mao Zedong summarized the above basic principles and policies of land reform as the overall strategy of land reform, namely, "relying on the poor peasants, uniting with the middle peasants, progressively and selectively eliminating the feudal exploitation system, and developing agricultural production." Since then, the large-scale land reform movement has developed healthily along this correct path. In just over a year after the publication of the "Outline of Chinese Land Law," our party completely solved the land problem in a vast area with a population of over 100 million, and distributed the land of the feudal class to the rural people, especially the poor and landless peasants. This greatly stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm and productivity of the main ally of the proletariat, the peasants.The vast number of farmers who have achieved liberation economically and politically have been working hard in production, actively joining the army, and actively supporting the front lines, providing a strong rear and an inexhaustible reserve force for the national liberation war. They have played an unprecedented role in replenishing troops, supplying army rations, and transporting war materials. The land reform movement, which was carried out comprehensively, thoroughly, and step by step, mobilized the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of peasants and won the support of all forces that could be won, enabling our party to obtain the most basic conditions to overcome all enemies and consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.
IV. Promote the formation and development of the second front.
After the outbreak of the full-scale civil war, under the brave fight and resolute resistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang army shifted from a comprehensive offensive to a key offensive, and the Kuomintang government suffered heavy blows militarily. At the same time, the Kuomintang government was also facing a serious economic and political crisis. Economically, the United States and Jiang signed a series of treaties and agreements. The US military acted arrogantly in China and acted unlawfully. According to incomplete statistics from Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and Tianjin, from August 1945 to the end of 1946, there were at least 3,800 incidents of US military atrocities, resulting in more than 300 casualties among our military and civilians, and more than 300 women were raped, further colonizing the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Kuomintang plundered the people, printed excessive amounts of money, causing hyperinflation, soaring prices, and making the people's lives unbearable, plunging the majority of the population into dire straits. Politically, the Kuomintang unilaterally convened a split National Assembly, sabotaged the Nanjing peace talks, and forced the Communist Party representatives to withdraw from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, completely exposing their true face of false peace. The broad masses of the people and democratic parties were educated by the Kuomintang's retrogression, becoming even more dissatisfied with the Kuomintang and placing their hopes on the Communist Party of China. Mao Zedong pointed out: "Based on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, American monopoly capital and Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic comprador capital are tightly combined, controlling the national economic life. As a result, there is extreme inflation, unprecedented price increases, the national industry and commerce are increasingly bankrupt, and the lives of the working masses and public servants are deteriorating. This situation forces people from all walks of life to unite and struggle to save themselves."
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China correctly analyzed the situation at the time and believed that a new climax of a nationwide People's Revolution was about to come. For this reason, Mao Zedong drafted a directive for the Party Central Committee on February 1, 1947, stating: "Current conditions in all aspects indicate that the situation in China is about to develop into a new stage. This new stage is the stage of the development of the nationwide anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle into a new People's Revolution. Now is the eve of this stage. Our party's task is to fight for the arrival and victory of this climax." On February 28, 1947, Zhou Enlai drafted instructions for the Central Committee on "Countermeasures against the Kuomintang in White Areas" and sent them to Dong Biwu, Liu Xiao, Qian Ying, Wu Yuzhang, Fang Fang, and others. The instructions stated: Although the people's struggle in the Chiang-controlled areas will experience some twists and turns, the overall trend will inevitably continue to rise. In response to Chiang's current policy of suppression, we should expand propaganda, avoid direct conflict, win over the middle forces, use legal forms, and strive to establish a broad alliance against selling out the country, against civil war, against dictatorship, and against terrorists and spies.
The instructions emphasized: "In the struggle, we must be connected and sometimes shift to economic struggles in order to mobilize a larger number of people and facilitate obtaining legal forms of action. With a broad foundation in economic struggle, it is also easier to connect to the struggle against spies and internal war." On May 5th, Zhou Enlai drafted instructions for the Central Committee of the Party and sent them to Liu Xiao, Liu Changsheng, Qian Ying, and others. In response to the Kuomintang government's fabrication of the so-called underground struggle route outline of the Communist Party of China, which attempted to use the pretext of suppressing the people's movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the instructions pointed out: in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the working principles of the Party are "to protect our Party and the forces of democratic progress in order to continue strengthening the people's movement," "for this purpose, we must be firm and brave, as well as cautious and vigilant." We must adhere to the Party's policy of mobilizing the masses to fight against the United States and Chiang, and carry out "legal and illegal struggles." The instructions emphasized: "In the urban work in areas under Chiang's control, we must plan for long-term existence in order to promote the people's struggle and launch a united front. Only in this way can we coordinate the victory of the Liberated Areas and promote the arrival of a new wave throughout the country." Under the specific guidance of the communist party organization and the united front policy, the people in the areas under the Kuomintang's rule have carried out patriotic and democratic movements opposing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in both urban and rural areas. By implementing policies that aimed to turn China into an American colony, Chiang and the United States launched a civil war and strengthened fascist and dictatorial rule. This declared themselves as enemies of the people nationwide and put all segments of the population on the brink of hunger and death, forcing them to unite and engage in a struggle of life and death against the Kuomintang government. Aside from this, there are no other options. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Chinese people from all walks of life who are suppressed by the policies of the Chiang Kai-shek government and are in a position of united self-salvation include workers, peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, enlightened intellectuals, other patriotic individuals, minority nationalities, and overseas Chinese. This is an extremely broad all-national unity front." On May 30, 1947, Mao Zedong pointed out: "There are already two battle lines within China. The war between Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops and the People's Liberation Army is the first battle line. Now a second battle line has emerged, which is the sharp struggle between the great student movement and the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek." The second battle line is led by the student movement and includes democratic movements of all segments of society oppressed under the Kuomintang's rule.
The starting point of the formation of the second battle line was the protest against the atrocities committed by the US military by Beijing students in December 1946. On the evening of December 24, 1946, a female student named Shen Chong at Peking University was raped by US servicemen. This news caused great indignation among the people of Beijing, especially the students. The underground party organization saw this as a good opportunity to mobilize the masses for struggle and immediately decided: Using the Shen Chong incident as a banner to defend national dignity and arouse the national indignation of the masses, launch a movement among Beijing students to protest the atrocities committed by the US military. The party organization decided to unite a larger number of students and initiated a student strike across the city's colleges and universities. The Kuomintang authorities sabotaged the student movement, attempting to "resolve" it through "legal means" in order to obscure its political nature of struggle. In response to the schemes of the reactionary forces of the United States and Chiang, the Communist Party organization put forward the central slogan of "US forces out of China" to carry out the struggle. This slogan has a clear political nature of struggle and is easy to unite the masses and expand the patriotic united front.
On December 29th, the Underground Party Study Committee in Beiping decided to hold a street demonstration. On December 30th, Beiping students took to the streets, shouting slogans such as "American soldiers, get out of China." The movement quickly spread nationwide, with 500,000 students participating. The anti-oppression movement directly targeted the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionary forces, marking a new high point in the struggles of the people in the Nationalist-controlled areas and becoming the starting point for the formation of a second front. Subsequently, the Communist Party's underground organization took the initiative to unite the masses and led the people in the Nationalist-controlled areas in one anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle after another. The movement in 947 marked the formation of the second front. Following the anti-oppression movement, due to the intensified economic control and political oppression by the Nationalist government, popular struggles continued to rise, and the patriotic democratic united front continuously expanded. In response to this situation, the Shanghai branch of the Communist Party reported to the Central Committee on April 28, 1947, pointing out that the mass movement in Chiang-controlled areas would soon experience a second peak after the anti-oppression movement, possibly starting in the fourth month (May). The Shanghai branch decided to mobilize the masses to first break through "from the continuous development of the struggle for livelihood," gradually developing to the political struggle against the Nationalist Party's "borrowing foreign debt and waging a civil war," and concentrating forces to "organize several central movements as the mainstream when they converge." On May 5th, Zhou Enlai drafted a telegram to Liu Xiao and others on behalf of the Central Committee, emphasizing the "need to protect our party and democratic progressive forces, in order to continue strengthening the people's movement" and calling for the release of the masses to launch a struggle against Chiang and America, and to expand the united front. According to the guidance of the Central Committee, the Shanghai branch decided to start various activities commemorating the May 4th Movement in universities across the Nationalist-controlled areas in early May 1947. Thus, the prelude to the struggle of the second front was opened. The Shanghai branch of the Communist Party believed that Nanjing was the "capital" of the Nationalist Party and had significant political influence, so it decided to break through in Nanjing and launch a shocking anti-civil war and anti-starvation movement. Under the leadership of the Shanghai branch, representatives from universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places gathered in Nanjing on May 20th, joining Nanjing University students, totaling over 6,000 people, to launch a massive anti-starvation and anti-civil war demonstration. The demonstration was suppressed by the Nationalist military, police, and special forces, resulting in the May 2nd bloodbath. The characteristics of this movement were, firstly, the development from economic struggles to political struggles, and secondly, the gradual convergence of scattered struggles into a unified nationwide struggle. The patriotic and democratic movement of the students received support from people across the country, rapidly expanding the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggles to over 60 large and medium-sized cities nationwide, forming a massive anti-Chiang and anti-American tide. In the struggle, the Communist Party paid great attention to the use of the united front strategy, emphasizing mobilizing the masses, uniting the majority, and utilizing contradictions within the enemy forces to divide and weaken the reactionary forces, while adhering to the principles of reasonableness, advantage, and moderation. At the time, there were differences within the ruling Nationalist group on how to handle the student movement. The Nationalist Legislative Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, and some university presidents feared that the violent actions of the Nationalist military, police, and special forces would escalate the situation and be difficult to contain. They advocated for mediation or negotiations to resolve it.
The Shanghai Bureau guided the masses to demand the release of all arrested students, punish the culprits, and focus their criticism on the Kuomintang army, police, and secret agents. At the same time, in order to reduce the repression from the Kuomintang army and police, Zhou Enlai pointed out in the instructions drafted by the Central Committee for the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the student movement on May 23: "In order to avoid confrontation with the young soldiers, police, and constables, and to win their sympathy for the student movement, and to undermine the power of Chiang Kai-shek suppressing the rear area, you should carry out soldier work among the young soldiers and constables through various organizations and active individuals, suggesting appropriate slogans to make them sympathize with the struggles of students for food and peace and their demand for higher wages after demobilization." At that time, some schools followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and sent students and young soldiers to celebrate together. When the marches in Shanghai and other places were obstructed by the military and police, they shouted at them, pointing out that their salaries were also meager and urging them to have a conscience. This in a way reduced the opposition sentiment on the other side. At the same time, the Shanghai Bureau also emphasized that when the masses are mobilized and victories are achieved in the struggle, they should proceed with caution. They should persuade active individuals to change their excessively radical demands for an indefinite boycott, and prevent them from alienating the majority of the masses. Therefore, the strategy of temporarily suspending the boycott, resuming classes while continuing the struggle, was proposed in a timely manner, and it gained widespread sympathy from students and society.
In order to promote the nationwide unity of students and prepare for new battles, the All-China Student Federation was established in mid-June 1947. The federation called on students across the country to unite regardless of party affiliation, belief, or region under the slogans of opposing hunger and fighting for survival, opposing civil war and struggling for peace, and opposing persecution and fighting for freedom, in order to form a strong united front and fight the domestic reactionaries to the end.
The struggle of the second front directly coordinated with the frontal battlefield of the People's Liberation Army. It disrupted the rear area under the rule of the Kuomintang, tied down and weakened Chiang Kai-shek's forces, and accelerated the process of the people's revolution's victory. The student movement elicited widespread sympathy from society, and workers, farmers, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentlemen, and patriotic overseas Chinese all stood on the side of the Communist Party, actively supporting and participating in the patriotic democratic movement. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang, exposed his monstrous face, became completely isolated, and found himself surrounded by the whole nation. The united front of the people's democratic coalition continuously strengthened and expanded, and the Chinese people were destined to achieve victory nationwide.
V. The formation of a new form of unified front organization under the people's democratic dictatorship.
As early as the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in response to the protracted nature of the war and the Kuomintang's dictatorial proposals of "disbanding the Communist Party," "limiting the Communist Party," and "fighting against the Communist Party," the Communist Party of China put forward the proposal for all parties in the Resistance Against Japan to persist in their independence while cooperating on the basis of mutual respect and consultation for the long term. In the practice of leading the anti-Japanese base areas, the Communist Party of China also established a "three-thirds" political system, in which one-third of the power was allocated to Communist Party members, left-wing progressive elements, middle-of-the-road individuals, and others respectively. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, where should China go? What kind of government should be established? Various classes formed political parties and groups, declaring their own views and opinions. For a time, the Chinese political stage presented a multi-party competition situation. After the full-scale launch of the Liberation War, the Communist Party of China regarded proper handling of relations with various parties as one of the important problems in establishing, consolidating, and developing the people's democratic united front. It put forward a policy of correctly handling relations with various democratic parties, thus fully forming a multi-party cooperation relationship led by the Communist Party of China and preliminarily establishing the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China.
To handle party relations correctly, it is necessary to analyze the nature of each political party scientifically. Mao Zedong and other members of the Communist Party of China conducted detailed research on the various democratic parties active on the Chinese political stage at that time, and made scientific analyses of their organizational composition and political tendencies, providing theoretical basis for handling relations with democratic parties correctly. In his "Opinions on the Current Work of Democratic Parties", Zhou Enlai pointed out that although the organizational composition of democratic parties is complex, ranging from opposition factions within the ruling class to progressive elements, they mainly represent the political interests of the upper petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals. They oppose the one-party rule of the Kuomintang, and the democratic parties and the democratic individuals associated with them are an important force that cannot be ignored on the Chinese political stage. Zhou Enlai also conducted an analysis of non-party democratic individuals, considering them to be de facto party members despite not being organized as a party. Based on their long-term participation in democratic political movements and struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, their activities themselves have a party character. The difference is that some democratic individuals do not have a party organization. Non-party democratic individuals are politically inclined in line with the political orientations of the democratic parties.
Based on the analysis of democratic parties and democratic individuals, the Communist Party of China proposed the policy of uniting with them and engaging in long-term cooperation to jointly construct a new China during the period of the Liberation War. At the same time, it is necessary to uphold the leadership of the proletariat and its political party, criticize or struggle against their shortcomings and mistakes during the long-term cooperation with them. Before the outbreak of the comprehensive civil war, the Communist Party actively sought joint actions with the democratic parties during the political struggle in negotiations with the Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the comprehensive civil war, in order to further cooperate with the democratic parties and democratic individuals, the Communist Party of China formulated and implemented a series of correct policies. In terms of politics, they absorbed a large number of progressive elements and intermediate forces outside the party to participate in the work of political power and social undertakings, and regularly communicated and coordinated with them on major issues such as land reform and the CCP-KMT negotiations. In terms of the economy, they resolutely implemented policies to protect national industry and commerce, and provided care and assistance in people's lives, ensuring their safety and health. The Communist Party of China also had extensive contacts and cooperation with the democratic parties and democratic individuals, carrying out in-depth and meticulous work to help them improve their understanding of the essence of American imperialism and the Kuomintang, enabling them to see the trend and direction of the development of the Chinese revolution and gradually embark on the path of the new democratic revolution.
The policy of cooperation and education with the democratic parties formulated and implemented by the Communist Party of China was correct and achieved success. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army had already gained a clear advantage in the strategic counteroffensive, the call made by the Communist Party of China to establish a democratic united government received positive responses from democratic individuals across various sectors of society. On April 30, 1948, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued the "May 1st International Workers' Day Proclamation", calling for "the unity of the laboring people nationwide with intellectuals, the liberal bourgeoisie, all democratic parties, social elites, and other patriotic individuals, to consolidate and expand the united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive together to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and establish a new China." "All democratic parties, people's organizations, and social elites quickly held political consultations, discussed and implemented the convening of a People's Representative Congress, and established a democratic united government." The call from the Communist Party of China received active responses from the democratic parties and democratic individuals.Lee Jishen and He Xiangning of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League of China, Ma Xulun and Wang Shao'ao of the China Democratic League, Chen Qiyou of the Zhigong Party of China, Peng Zemin of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Li Zhangda of the China People's Salvation Association, Cai Tingcuo of the Democratic Progressive Party of the Kuomintang, Tan Pingshan of the Society of Comrades of the Three Principles and Guo Moruo, an independent democratic figure, jointly sent a telegram to Mao Zedong in response to the Communist Party's call for the May 1st Labor Day, stating that the slogan of the May 1st Labor Day "... is in line with the requirements of the people's current situation and is particularly consistent with the original intention of comrades." They also expressed their willingness to work together with the Communist Party of China for the completion of the great cause. Subsequently, leaders of various democratic parties and independent democratic figures were invited by the Communist Party of China to enter the liberated areas in batches to prepare for the convening of a new political consultative conference. On January 22, 1949, a total of 55 leaders of various democratic parties and independent democratic figures, including Li Jishen and Shen Junru who had arrived in the liberated areas, jointly issued their opinions on the current situation in a statement titled "Our Views on the Situation," stating that they were "willing to dedicate themselves to the cause under the leadership of the Communist Party of China" and also believed that "there can be no compromise or reconciliation between revolution and counter-revolution" and "within the people's democratic front, there is absolutely no room for reactionary forces, and the so-called middle-of-the-road line is not allowed to exist".The support and response of various democratic figures to the May 1st call not only indicated that the Communist Party of China had already established its leading position in the cooperation of various democratic parties, but also marked the initial formation of a multi-party cooperation led by the Communist Party of China. The united front of the people's democracy has entered a new stage in history.
After acknowledging the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the various democratic figures entered the liberated areas and the CPC Central Committee clearly defined the principles and policies for further cooperation and handling relations with the democratic parties. On January 22, 1949, the CPC Central Committee issued the "Instructions on the Treatment of Democratic Figures," which stated that the party should adopt a thoroughly sincere and honest attitude toward democratic figures, explaining to them all political and party policy issues, actively educating and winning them over. On policy issues, positive answers should be given without evasion. Except for the party's secrets and certain specific strategies, everything that can be discussed openly should be discussed. The actual implementation of policies should also be reported truthfully, and they should be fully encouraged to express their opinions and criticism to strengthen the spirit of joint efforts. The method should be chosen based on their proposals, with responsible officials of the Communist Party of China making reports, holding discussions, organizing visits, or organizing daily contacts and conversations with a part of the party members. They can talk with any responsible officials of the Communist Party of China and exchange opinions.
As for how to treat the local organizations and their development of various democratic parties and groups, the CPC Central Committee also made clear instructions. In February 1949, the CPC Central Committee pointed out in the "Instructions on How to Treat the Local Organizations of Various Democratic Parties and Groups" that the local organizations of democratic parties and groups that had already been established before the CPC Central Committee's May 1st call and had made some efforts in the joint struggle against imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang should be recognized as their legal status and protected after obtaining certification from the headquarters of these parties. They can also engage in activities in the name of the parties and develop party members or members. It was also stated that any party, including the democratic parties, must absolutely abide by the regulations of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Government, and the Military Control Committee.
These principles and policies for handling party relations laid the foundation for the Communist Party of China to propose the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" after the establishment of New China.
With the initial formation of a multi-party cooperation led by the Communist Party of China, there was a need to establish a united front organization to negotiate and handle their differences of opinion.In 1948, after the slogan of "promptly convening a political consultative conference" was put forward in the May 1st slogan, the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties actively prepared for the convening of the political consultative conference. The political consultative conference gradually evolved into a broad united front organization led by the Communist Party of China, with representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic individuals from all walks of life, domestic ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese participating.
The name "political consultative conference" existed before the May 1st slogan. In January 1946, under the pressure of the people's demands for peaceful democracy, the Kuomintang government held a political consultative conference, and with the consultative efforts of the Communist Party, it passed five resolutions favorable to democracy, peace, unity, and solidarity. However, the Kuomintang government quickly tore up the resolutions of the consultative conference and launched a comprehensive civil war. However, this form of democratic consultation left a great impression on the people. As Mao Zedong pointed out in the opening speech of the first plenary session of the People's Political Consultative Conference: "The reason why our conference is called a political consultative conference is that three years ago, we held a political consultative conference together with the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek. The result of that conference was destroyed by the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek and its henchmen, but it left an indelible impression among the people. In order to distinguish it from the political consultative conference held in January 1946, in November 1948, after discussions between the representatives of the CPC and democratic individuals, it was decided to refer to the political consultative conference of 1946 as the "old consultative conference" and the upcoming conference as the "new consultative conference." On September 17, 1949, during the second preparatory meeting of the new consultative conference, it was decided to rename the "new political consultative conference" as the "Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference", abbreviated as "CPPCC". The lineup of the new CPPCC was very strong, and the units and representative quotas and lists agreed to participate in the new CPPCC were determined through multi-party consultations, careful deliberation, and several months of efforts. Representatives of the new CPPCC were divided into five categories: party representatives, regional representatives, military representatives, group representatives, and specially invited representatives. Compared with the old CPPCC, the new CPPCC had three prominent features: first, the representatives were diverse, including representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, People's Liberation Army, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and religious circles, fully reflecting the great unity of all nationalities, democratic classes, and all patriotic democratic forces in the new democratic revolution of China; at the same time, it also included well-known individuals and representatives who had made contributions to the cause of the people in various historical periods of the Chinese national democratic revolution, from the 1911 Revolution, the Northern Expedition, the May Fourth Movement, the War of Resistance Against Japan to the Liberation War. Representatives from various revolutionary periods were included, as well as individuals who had prestige during the late Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang government period and later sympathized with the revolution and did good deeds for the people. Second, the seriousness of political standards. Although the lineup of the new CPPCC was extremely extensive, covering all aspects of society, it was based on the seriousness of politics and strictly distinguished between enemies, ourselves, and friends. According to the provisions of the preparatory meeting organizational regulations, those who did not meet or fully meet the standards for participating in the new CPPCC were not invited by party or group units and were urged to dissolve or cease their activities. At the same time, attention was paid to broad unity, and democratic individuals who had a history of democratic movement and had practical performances in the War of Liberation, after their political organizations or groups declared their end, were invited to participate in the new CPPCC or be appropriately arranged to work in the coalition government. Third, it ensured the leadership of the Communist Party while embodying the unity and cooperation between the Communist Party and non-Party individuals. The leadership of the Communist Party was not based on simple majority rule, but on equal and sincere cooperation with democratic individuals, adopting the method of democratic consultation to achieve political consensus. As a party unit, the Communist Party had the same number of representatives as the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the China Democratic League (CDL). Moreover, if the party members from the liberated areas, different regions, and basic mass unit representatives from workers, peasants, youth, women, etc. were added, they still accounted for the majority.In this way, the new Political Consultative Conference not only embodies the leadership of the proletariat and the advantages of the worker-peasant alliance, but also has a considerable number of non-party members participating, paying attention to the broadness of unity. 
In September 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was grandly held in Beijing. The conference passed the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It stipulated that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is composed of representatives of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, various regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democrats, is the organizational form of the people's democratic united front. This organizational form will exist for a long time and, before the convening of the nationwide People's Congress, will exercise the functions and powers of the nationwide People's Congress. After the nationwide People's Congress is convened through general elections, it will propose proposals to the nationwide People's Congress or the Central People's Government on fundamental national construction plans and other important measures, and play a role in consultation, deliberation, and promotion. The Organic Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the purpose of the political consultative conference is to unite through the unity of various democratic parties and people's organizations, unite all democratic classes and ethnic groups in China, and make joint efforts to implement new democracy, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, eradicate open and hidden remnants of counter-revolutionaries, heal the wounds of war, restore and develop the people's economic and cultural and educational undertakings, consolidate national defense, and unite with equal treatment countries and nations in the world, establish and consolidate the independent, democratic, peaceful, united, and prosperous People's Republic of China led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Organic Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference also stipulates its organizational structure: the National Committee is generated by the Plenary Session, and local committees are set up in central cities, important regions, and provincial capitals. These organizations practice a high degree of democracy internally. 
The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference plays the role of a temporary constitution. Its formulation and adoption legally confirm the multi-party cooperation political party system and political system led by the Communist Party of China, and confirm that the Political Consultative Conference is an organizational form of the people's democratic united front. This is not only a historical result of China's new democratic revolution, but also an inevitable product of the development of the revolutionary united front led by the Communist Party of China. It has created a new form of united front organization with Chinese characteristics under the people's democratic dictatorship. 
VI. The Correct Handling of the Relationship between Leaders and the Led
During the period of the national liberation war, one important reason why the people's democratic united front led by the working class (through the Communist Party of China) based on the worker-peasant alliance was able to consolidate and expand unprecedentedly was that the issue of the relationship between leaders and the led was correctly handled. In January 1948, Mao Zedong deeply summarized the historical experience of our party in realizing the leadership of the proletariat over the united front and put forward two conditions that the working class and the Communist Party of China must possess in order to realize the leadership of the led classes, strata, political parties, and people's organizations: "(a) leading the led (allies) in resolute struggle against the common enemy and achieving victory; (b) providing material benefits to the led, at least not harming their interests, and providing political education to the led. Without these two conditions, or when either of the two conditions is lacking, leadership cannot be achieved." Mao Zedong also specifically pointed out: "In order to lead the middle peasants, the Communist Party must lead them in resolute struggle against the feudal class and achieve victory (eliminate armed landlords and divide landlord land). If there is no resolute struggle, or even with struggle but without victory, the middle peasants will waver. In addition, a part of the landlord's land and property should be distributed to the poorer middle peasants, without harming the interests of the well-to-do middle peasants." At the same time, certain rights should be given to the middle peasants politically and they should be educated. Similarly, "the urban working class and the Communist Party in the city must also realize the leadership of the middle class, democratic parties, and people's organizations oppressed and harmed by the reactionary forces in the same way" .In other words, on the one hand, we must strive to guide them to join the struggle of workers, peasants, and the urban petite bourgeoisie against Chiang Kai-shek and the US, or at least remain neutral; continuously reinforce their revolutionary consciousness with the victories achieved by the people's revolution in all areas, overcome their tendency to compromise and vacillate. On the other hand, put forward an economic program to protect the interests of national industry and commerce and a series of economic policies to ensure that their material interests are not harmed; and educate them to continuously improve their understanding of the new democratic revolution. In this way, our party has the basic conditions for leading the national bourgeoisie and their political parties.
Mao Zedong further pointed out: "In the ruling areas of Chiang Kai-shek, among the upper petite bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, there is a small group of right-wing elements who have reactionary political tendencies. They spread illusions for American imperialism and the reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek, and they oppose the people's democratic revolution. When their reactionary tendencies still have influence on the masses, we should expose them to the masses who are influenced by them, fight against their political influence among the masses, and liberate the masses from their influence." However, the lessons from 1927 to 1931 tell us that when the right wing of the upper petite bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie echo Chiang Kai-shek's group in opposing the revolution, our party correctly fought against their reactionary tendencies politically, and often eliminated them economically, which caused the revolution serious losses. In view of this, Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in 1947: "Political repression and economic elimination are two different things. If we confuse these two things, we will make mistakes." "Due to the backwardness of China's economy, the capitalist economy represented by the upper petite bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist even after the revolution has won nationwide, and according to the division of national economy, all beneficial parts need to be developed." Therefore, regarding the economic status of the national bourgeoisie, namely the upper petite bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, "we must handle it cautiously, and adopt a policy of universal protection in principle."
Based on Mao Zedong's above-mentioned ideas, our party formulated the industrial and commercial policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking care of both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital", to "protect the property of industrial and commercial workers and their legitimate business from infringement" and to enable them to develop economically. However, in the process of implementing this policy, there still exists in some areas the phenomenon of disrupting industry and commerce. The main manifestations are: emphasizing the immediate welfare of workers in the workers' movement, infringing on the interests of the national bourgeoisie; infringing on the industrial and commercial operations of landlords and rich peasants in the land reform; exceeding the scope of investigating economic counter-revolutionaries during the purge; striking against industrial and commercial workers in the tax policy, etc. The Central Committee of the Party and Mao Zedong attached great importance to this and resolutely corrected it. Mao Zedong pointed out that the party organizations at all levels should "preemptively prevent the wrong application of the methods of struggle against landlords and rich peasants, the elimination of feudal exploitation, which are applied in the countryside, to the cities; strictly distinguish the elimination of feudal exploitation from the protection of the industrial and commercial operations of landlords and rich peasants; strictly distinguish the correct policy of developing production, prosper the economy, take care of both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital from the relief policy that one-sidedly, narrowly, practically disrupts industry and commerce and damages the cause of the people's revolution, under the name of supporting workers' welfare." Establishing our policy on these distinctions, alleviating the fears of the national bourgeoisie about the new democratic revolutionary program, gradually bringing them closer to the political and policy levels required by the revolutionary struggle at that time, and better uniting with the workers, peasants, and urban petite bourgeoisie to oppose the common enemy, or remain neutral. With the victory of the people's revolution approaching, our party, through more in-depth political education, assisted the democratic parties in breaking away from their neutral position and raising them to the level of accepting the new democratic revolutionary program.In summary, after the rupture of the united front with the bureaucratic bourgeoisie represented by the Jiang Jieshi group, the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong continued to implement the theory and practice of both unity and struggle with the national bourgeoisie, creating favorable conditions for the national bourgeoisie to ultimately accept the leadership of the working class.
In conclusion, during the period of the nationwide liberation war, the Party Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong launched an unprecedented large-scale land reform movement, further consolidating the alliance between the workers and peasants. Based on the alliance led by the working class, all efforts were made to unite and win over all those who could be united and won over, including not only the national bourgeoisie, but also patriotic individuals who had separated from the ruling clique of the Kuomintang and enlightened gentlemen who had separated from the feudal landlord class. This made the people's democratic united front unprecedentedly consolidated and strengthened, and completely isolated the Jiang Jieshi group. In April 1948, our party put forward the call to convene a political consultative conference without reactionary elements and discuss the establishment of a democratic united government, which immediately received enthusiastic responses from all democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic individuals. They sent representatives to enter the liberated areas and jointly carry out the preparatory work for the new political consultation with our party. During the victorious climax of the strategic decisive battle of the People's Liberation Army, the democratic parties announced their agreement with our party's policies on industry and commerce and land reform, recognized that the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was the root cause of counterrevolutionary civil war and the fundamental obstacle to domestic peace and democracy, and pointed out that American imperialism was the enemy of the Chinese people. They jointly issued a statement, openly declaring the abandonment of the middle-of-the-road approach and the acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This was a major victory for our party in correctly handling its relationship with the bourgeoisie.
Section 1: Armed struggle is the main form of the Chinese democratic revolution.
I. The emergence and establishment of the armed struggle ideology of the Communist Party of China.
The doctrine of armed struggle is an important part of the ideological theory of the Communist Party of China and one of the three magic weapons for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Based on the specific environment and conditions of China, the Communist Party of China has gradually enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of armed struggle in the process of revolutionary practice.
In the early period after the establishment of our party, we did not fully recognize the extreme importance of armed struggle. Mao Zedong correctly pointed out when summing up the experience in this regard: "In this regard, our party was insufficiently aware from its establishment in 1921 until its participation in the Northern Expedition in 1926 for the five or six years. At that time, we did not understand the extreme importance of armed struggle in China, did not seriously prepare for war and organize armies, and did not focus on the study of military strategy and tactics." Of course, this does not refer to all members of the party, as some party members already had many outstanding insights into the important position of armed struggle in the Chinese revolution.
Zhou Enlai had an early understanding of the importance of armed struggle. In an article titled "Evaluation of Hu Shi's 'Effort'" published on December 15, 1922, during his stay in Europe, he pointed out: "A genuine revolution must have an extremely strong and well-organized revolutionary army. Without a revolutionary army, warlords cannot be overthrown." This was the preliminary idea of armed seizure of power. In early 1925, Zhou Enlai actively participated in and commanded the Dongzheng campaign of the Huangpu Student Army, using armed forces to defeat the main force of the reactionary warlord Chen Jiongming. Afterwards, in his report to the Huangpu Student Army on "The Political Work of the Army," he emphasized: "When the workers and peasants are excessively oppressed, they will inevitably become aware and use armed force to resist their oppressors." He used the victory of the October Revolution as an example to inspire everyone, explaining that it was "the workers and peasants using armed force to overthrow the Russian emperor and nobility.""The oppressed people and oppressed ethnic minorities in China, when they become aware of the oppression of imperialists and warlords, will use the force they have created to overthrow imperialism and warlords." Obviously, Zhou Enlai has made significant contributions to the issue of armed struggle, both in theory and practice.
Deng Zhongxia also said in January 1924: When the revolutionary ideology and actions of the national masses have become extremely intense and turbulent, military activities are not only indispensable, but also one of the important tasks. At this time, Y+Qingjing also said: Revolution cannot completely separate from armed combat. These understandings are very valuable.
In particular, Qu Qiubai had many insights into the issue of armed struggle and was a leader in our party who had a relatively comprehensive understanding of the importance of armed struggle in the early days. After the May 30th Movement in 1925, he discussed the importance of armed struggle in a series of articles he published. He said, "Civilians should have the right to arm for self-defense." In October 1925, Qu Qiubai, in light of the ongoing anti-Feng War at the time, believed that "if the people are armed and carry out the anti-Feng War, this naturally marks the beginning of the national revolution and the development of a new period in the national revolutionary movement." The armed struggle being seen as a symbol of a new stage of revolution was an important contribution by Qu Qiubai. He also pointed out the correct attitude of a revolutionary towards armed struggle: "One should not fear armed uprisings" but should "actively unite all forces in conflict with the warlords and imperialists to wage revolutionary war" and "prepare for a revolutionary war by arming the people" in order to "establish a central government of the people." Qu Qiubai has already linked armed struggle with the seizure of political power. On the eve of the Northern Expedition, Qu Qiubai's theories on armed struggle reached a new level. In addition to repeatedly emphasizing the use of "the war of the revolutionary army and the armed uprising of the people" to counter imperialist aggression and "extinguish all counterrevolutionary warlords," he particularly expressed the idea that armed struggle is the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution. He said, "The central issue of the current revolutionary movement is to prepare for revolutionary war," and all other forms of struggle are "direct or indirect preparations for revolutionary war," and only revolutionary war is the main method.
Due to the development of the situation, the party's understanding of armed struggle was elevated on the eve of the Northern Expedition. In February 1926, at a special meeting convened by the party's central committee in Beijing, the party determined that its primary task at the time was to prepare for the Northern Expedition of the Guangdong government from all aspects in order to overthrow the rule of imperialism and warlords through revolutionary war. In May 1926, the independent detachment led by Ye Ting, under the leadership of the party, entered Hunan as the advance force of the Northern Expedition, marking the beginning of the Northern Expedition. In order to closely coordinate with the progress of the Northern Expedition, in July 1926, the party held the Third Expanded Central Executive Committee, and in the "Resolution on Military Operations" passed at the meeting, it clearly stated, "Our party is a party of the proletarian revolution, ready to engage in armed uprisings at any time, and in the process of national revolution, should participate in the work of armed struggle and foster progressive military forces. At the same time, this work is to enable the party to gain organized experience in preparing for armed uprisings." By specifically placing party leadership of armed uprisings on the important agenda of the party's meeting, it indicates that the party's recognition of the importance of armed struggle has undergone a new leap.The resolution then reminded the entire party: "Although our comrades have recently paid attention to military movements, which is a significant improvement compared to the situation where our comrades did not pay attention to military movements before, it must be pointed out that this progress is still limited, mainly manifested in 'failure to understand the responsibility of our party's current military work and the significance of obtaining organized experience in preparing for armed uprisings'."
Under the guidance of the ideological content of this resolution, the party led the Shanghai working class to carry out three armed uprisings in October 1926 and March 1927. The first two uprisings failed under the enemy's crazy suppression, but the third uprising learned from the lessons of the previous failures, and under the leadership of Zhou Enlai, Luo Yinong, Zhao Shiyan and others, achieved glorious victory. This was an important practice of the party leading armed uprisings. Zhao Shiyan highly praised this armed uprising of the Shanghai working class in his article "Records of the March Uprising of Shanghai Workers" written in April 1927. He believed that "since the October Revolution in Russia, the revolutionary achievements of the proletariat have added a new historical record in the March uprising of the Shanghai workers. In the revolutionary history of China, the bloody achievements of the working class are determined by the March uprising of the Shanghai workers. The position of the March uprising in the world revolutionary history is written on the first page after the October Revolution. The position of the March uprising in the Chinese revolutionary history determines the nature of the Chinese revolution, guarantees the victory of the Chinese revolution, and delineates a new chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution." He also emphasized: "The proletarian uprising is the most serious lesson in Marxist-Leninist teachings." Zhao Shiyan explicitly expressed the important idea that violent revolution is one of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is very innovative. In the summer of 1927, there was a sudden change in the domestic political situation. On April 12th, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary coup. In the middle and late May, reactionary officers Xia Doutan and Xu Kexiang successively launched attacks against the revolution. Faced with a dire situation, Mao Zedong and Cai Hesen proposed many emergency measures. Cai Hesen repeatedly suggested to the Central Committee to resolutely counterattack and put forward the proposition of "using attack to counterattack and using uprising to counter uprising". On June 25th, in a letter to the members of the Central Committee, he urgently exclaimed: "If we sit still and wait for others to deal with us, it is no different from fish in a boiling pot! We demand that the Central Committee and the army immediately examine their own strength, make military plans in case of emergency." However, all the correct opinions were rejected by Chen Duxiu, eventually leading to the failure of the Northern Expedition.
After the failure of the Northern Expedition, our party learned a valuable lesson and took a big step forward in understanding armed struggle. In 1927, the party's "August 7th" meeting settled Chen Duxiu's right opportunist mistakes, determined the overall policy of land revolution and armed resistance against the slaughter of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which was a decision of epoch-making significance. Before and after this, the party led a series of armed uprisings. Since then, the party has entered a new stage of creating its own armed forces and leading large-scale armed struggle.
II. The basic content of the theory of armed struggle of the Communist Party of China
The central task and the highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power.
First, the characteristics of Chinese society determine that the Chinese revolution starts with armed struggle.
Any social revolution is a product of class struggle under certain historical conditions, and it is closely related to a certain social and political environment. Its forms of struggle and organization must be adapted to these social characteristics.In his article "War and Strategic Issues," Mao Zedong provides a detailed and profound analysis of the differences between capitalist countries and Chinese society, as well as the different forms of revolutionary struggle that arise as a result.
In capitalist countries, violent revolution is the highest form of struggle that occurs under specific historical conditions and is built upon long-term legal struggles. Capitalist countries no longer have feudal systems or foreign oppression, but have established bourgeois democratic systems. The proletariat has certain freedoms of speech, association, and assembly, as well as the right to organize labor unions and engage in political and economic strikes. They have the opportunity to advocate for political and economic interests through parliamentary forums. Therefore, as long as there is no fascist war, the main task of the proletarian party is to organize workers in non-violent legal struggles, educating and mobilizing them to eventually overthrow capitalism. Regarding the issue of war, the Communist Party in those countries opposes imperialistic wars waged by their own nation, as their desired war is only an internal one. "However, this war should not be launched until the bourgeoisie is truly impotent, until the majority of the proletariat is determined to engage in armed uprisings and war, and until the peasant masses willingly support the proletariat."
When analyzing the characteristics of the Chinese political environment, Mao Zedong points out that China is different from capitalist countries. China is not a democratic country, but rather a semi-colonized and semi-feudal country in which internal affairs are devoid of democratic systems and are oppressed by feudalism, while there is no national independence externally and are oppressed by imperialism. There are no parliaments to utilize and no rights to legally strike or organize workers. Additionally, warlordism exists domestically, with various warlords, landlords, and gentry possessing their own armed forces. The more military forces they have, the greater their power, and they implement bloody suppression and massacres against the proletariat and laboring masses. In this kind of political environment, the "basic task of the Communist Party is not to enter into uprising and war through long-term legal struggles." The main and immediate task is to unite as many allied forces as possible, organize armed struggles, and, depending on the situation, resist internal or external armed counter-revolutionaries in the fight for national and social liberation.
Based on the differences between China and capitalist countries mentioned above, Mao Zedong consistently adheres to the view that "the central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power" when expounding on this fundamental principle. He maintains that "in China, war is the main form of struggle, and the main form of organization is the army."
Secondly, in any historical period or circumstances, the Chinese revolution must prioritize armed struggle and persist in resolving problems through war.
At every stage of the development of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong consistently emphasizes that armed struggle is the primary form of the revolution and gradually develops a complete theoretical framework.
During the period of the Great Revolution, Mao Zedong proposed that the Communist Party should have its own independent armed forces and assist in the establishment of armed forces for the peasants. On July 4, 1927, during a party central committee discussion on the situation and party policies, he pointed out that the peasant self-defense army must be retained and, if necessary, can retreat to the mountains to build a foundation for military forces. Later, when summarizing the lessons learned from the failure of the first cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, he remarked, "From the time our party was founded in 1921 to the five to six years of our participation in the Northern Expedition War, we had an insufficient understanding of armed struggle in China. We did not seriously prepare for war and organize armies, nor did we emphasize the study of military strategy and tactics. During the Northern Expedition, we neglected to win over the military, focusing solely on mass movements. As a result, once the Kuomintang became reactionary, all mass movements collapsed."
During the period of the Land Revolution War, Mao Zedong wrote a series of works addressing the issue that the party's work center had not yet focused on armed struggle for a certain period of time (mainly before the central party organs moved to the base area). He addressed the lack of confidence and incorrect understanding of the forms of armed struggle among some members of the party and the army who doubted how long the Red Flag could last. He emphasized the necessity and possibility of armed agrarian revolution and its significant importance for seizing national power. He believed that the land revolution must be combined with armed struggle, and armed struggle must be combined with the establishment of a proletarian peasant government and revolutionary base areas. "The establishment and development of the Red Army, guerrilla forces, and red areas is the highest form of the peasant struggle under the leadership of the proletariat in semi-colonial China, and is undoubtedly the most important factor promoting the nationwide revolutionary upsurge." This understanding of firmly adhering to armed struggle played a decisive role in shifting the party's work center to leading the revolutionary war. In 1936, Mao Zedong wrote "On the Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War," in which he used a Marxist perspective on warfare to comprehensively summarize the experience of the land revolution war, systematically expounded the fundamental views and attitudes of communists towards war, and deeply analyzed the characteristics, laws, and correct guiding principles of the Chinese revolutionary war. He further emphasized the importance of the party's study of revolutionary war, leadership of revolutionary war, and insistence on using revolutionary war to combat counterrevolutionary war. It was an important milestone in the maturity of our party's theory of armed struggle.
During the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zedong pointed out that when facing foreign imperialist aggression, we unite all forces that can be united to fight a national war, but it does not mean giving up the principle of armed seizure of power. It is only a step towards realizing this principle, and therefore, it is a part of armed seizure of power. He elucidated the relationship between overthrowing imperialism and feudalism, pointing out that they are interconnected. "Without overthrowing imperialism's rule, it is impossible to eliminate the rule of the landlord class, as imperialism is the main supporter of the landlord class. Conversely, because the landlord class is the main social foundation of imperialist rule in China, and the peasants are the main force of the Chinese revolution, if we do not help the peasants overthrow the landlord class, we cannot form a powerful force to overthrow imperialist rule." Mao Zedong, on the one hand, consistently opposed national capitulationism and successively published a series of brilliant works such as "Oppose Japan's Aggression: Policy, Methods, and Prospects" and "On Protracted War." He expounded the theory of comprehensive resistance and protracted resistance, providing powerful ideological and theoretical weapons for the formation of a nationwide anti-Japanese war and the achievement of victory in the war. On the other hand, he also opposed class capitulationism, adhered to the principle of independence and autonomy of our party in the united front, and criticized and overcome the rightist errors represented by Wang Ming. He pointed out that by adhering to independence and autonomy, we can maintain our original positions, especially develop new positions, and this is a central link that leads the anti-Japanese national revolution to victory. In response to the anti-Communist wave launched by the stubborn faction of the Kuomintang, Mao Zedong proposed the three principles of rationality, advantage, and restraint. The first principle is self-defense: "We will not attack unless attacked, but if attacked, we will certainly counterattack." In the face of the military offensives by the stubborn faction, we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them. The second principle is the principle of victory: "If we do not fight, we will lose; if we fight, we will win." The third principle is the principle of ceasefire: "After driving back the stubborn faction for a certain period, we should cease fire in order to ensure the development and strengthening of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during the Anti-Japanese War, so as to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and prepare strong forces for overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang."
After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on August 13, 1945, Mao Zedong delivered a speech entitled "The Situation After the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and Our Policy" at the Yan'an Cadre Conference. He deeply analyzed the basic political situation of China after the War of Resistance Against Japan, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to seize the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, launch a counter-revolutionary civil war, and trend towards the inevitable massacre of the people. Chiang Kai-shek has already sharpened his knife, and we must also sharpen our knife. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to take away the people's power inch by inch, and to obtain every advantage, our policy is to not give an inch and to fight for every inch of land. The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended through combat. In the following period of time, an unprecedented trend of peace and democracy emerged internationally, and there were also signs of peaceful coexistence between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang in China. Some communist members were overly optimistic about the prospects of peace, believing that parliamentary struggle would become the main form of struggle. In response to this tendency, Mao Zedong reiterated that the Chinese revolution must take the path of armed seizure of power and pointed out: "The reactionary forces toward the democratic forces of the people's democracy can be eliminated if they can be, and if they cannot be eliminated temporarily, we must be prepared to eliminate them in the future. In response to this situation, the democratic forces of the people toward the reactionary forces should adopt the same principle." Before going to Chongqing for negotiations, Mao Zedong once again pointed out to the party that we must never rely on negotiations and never hope for the Kuomintang to have good intentions. We must rely on the strength in our own hands. During the negotiations in Chongqing, he also instructed the entire army to resolutely counterattack the Kuomintang's attacks, believing that the more victories we achieve, the more active and secure our negotiations will be. After the negotiations in Chongqing, when discussing strategies regarding downsizing of the military, Mao Zedong emphasized: "The people's armed forces, whether it be a gun or a bullet, must be preserved and not handed over." After the PLA achieved decisive victories in the three major battles, the Kuomintang ruling clique, with the support and planning of the American ambassador to China, Stuart, launched a peace offensive, attempting to use peaceful negotiations to achieve the goal of "ruling by force across the Yangtze River", in order to gain breathing room, maintain the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and then make a comeback. In response to this situation, Mao Zedong issued a great call to the entire party, army, and people of the country to "carry the revolution through to the end", pointing out that the enemy will not self-destruct, whether it be the reactionary forces in China or the imperialist forces of American aggression in China. It is necessary to use revolutionary methods to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate all reactionary forces, to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang nationwide, and to establish a proletarian-led, people's democratic dictatorship with the unity of workers and peasants as the main body. The Communist Party of China, guided by Mao Zedong's theory of armed struggle, persisted in placing armed struggle first in any situation at any time and thus achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution.
Third, all non-armed organizations and forms of struggle must be coordinated and serve the armed struggle.
While emphasizing that armed struggle is the main form of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong also pointed out: "Everything else, such as the organization and struggle of the masses, is very important. They are all necessary and cannot be ignored, but they are all for the sake of war." and he emphasized that this coordination and service should run through the entire process and all aspects of the revolution.
The so-called entire process means that before the outbreak of war and during the war, all of the party's organizations and forms of struggle must serve the party and the revolutionary war. Before the outbreak of war, all organizations and struggles must revolve around preparing for war and mobilizing for war, in order to eliminate various obstacles that affect the revolutionary war, and to mobilize all forces participating in the war, such as the nationwide anti-Japanese salvation movement, anti-internal war movement, the December 9th student movement initiated by the party before the War of Resistance Against Japan. It was these movements that propelled the surge of national anti-Japanese patriotism, leading to the Xi'an Incident and a peaceful resolution.After the outbreak of war, all forms of organization and struggle must be directly or indirectly in coordination with the revolutionary war. For example, during the anti-Japanese war, the Communist Party's rectification movement, the mass production movement in the liberated areas, and the popular movements in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were all conducted for the victory of the war.
The so-called comprehensive nature means that regardless of the front or rear, the liberated area or the enemy-occupied area, the city or the countryside, the political and cultural centers or the remote areas, the organizational work of the party and the mass movements in most parts of China must be directly linked to armed struggle and must only serve the demands of the front lines. Armed struggle is the characteristic and advantage of the Chinese revolution.
Stalin pointed out in his article "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution": "In China, armed revolution opposes armed counterrevolution. This is one of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and also one of its advantages." Mao Zedong fully affirmed the correctness of this conclusion. In his concluding report at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in November 1938, he analyzed the nature of the Chinese revolution and the common characteristics of each stage since the Northern Expedition, and pointed out that Stalin's viewpoint completely suits the practical situation of the Chinese revolution. The problems in China cannot be solved without armed struggle, and no revolutionary tasks can be completed without armed struggle. In 1939, in his "Inaugural Address for the Publication of the 'Communist'" he raised armed struggle and united front as the two fundamental characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and referred to armed struggle, united front, and party-building as the three magic weapons of the Chinese revolution, further emphasizing that armed struggle is the main form of the Chinese revolution.
First, the nature and tasks of the Chinese revolution are closely linked to armed struggle. 
Mao Zedong pointed out when analyzing the characteristics of the Chinese revolution: "Because China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, with unbalanced development in politics, economy, and culture, a country where semi-feudal economy is dominant and with vast land, this not only determines that the nature of the Chinese revolution at the current stage is a bourgeoisie-democratic revolution, with imperialism and feudalism as the main targets of the revolution, and the basic driving forces of the revolution are the proletariat, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, but also, at certain periods and to a certain extent, the participation of the national bourgeoisie. It also determines that the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle is armed struggle." He believes that the armed revolution against armed counterrevolution is a characteristic of semi-colonial China and does not exist in the revolutionary history led by communist parties in other capitalist countries.
The enemies of the Chinese revolution, namely feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic comprador capitalism, all possess powerful counterrevolutionary armed forces and rely on force to maintain their rule and achieve their political objectives through counterrevolutionary wars. In order for the proletariat and the oppressed and exploited masses to achieve liberation and overthrow these armed enemies, armed struggle must be conducted. From the birth of the Communist Party of China to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese revolution has gone through four historical stages: the Northern Expedition, the Land Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, and the Liberation War. The objects opposed in these wars are all armed counterrevolutionaries, and the main components participating in the wars are the armed revolutionary people. "The only difference lies in whether it is an internal war or a national war; whether it is a war conducted solely by the Communist Party or a war jointly conducted by the CPC and the Kuomintang... However, they are all armed revolutionary struggles against armed counterrevolution, they are revolutionary wars, and they represent the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution." The history of the Chinese revolution fully proves that without armed struggle, there is no status for the proletariat, the people, and the Communist Party, and there can be no victory in the revolution.
Second, the development and strengthening of the Communist Party of China are connected to armed struggle.
A significant difference between the Communist Party of China and proletarian parties in capitalist countries is that the Communist Party of China developed through armed struggle, while proletarian parties in capitalist countries developed through long-term legal struggles. Armed uprisings are the result of the development and growth of the proletarian parties in capitalist countries, rather than the path and reason for the growth of the parties. The Communist Party of China, on the other hand, is different. Before the Party seized power, its history was, in fact, a history of armed struggle. Mao Zedong clearly pointed out, "The development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our Party took place in revolutionary wars. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today."
During the period of the Great Revolution, although our Party began to understand the importance of armed struggle, it did not fully comprehend its significance. It did not understand that armed struggle was the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution, and did not focus its main efforts on the development of revolutionary armed forces. As a result, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, a large number of Communist Party members were brutally killed, and the Party construction and cause suffered serious losses. During the revolutionary war for land reform, our Party had already established an independent armed force and revolutionary base areas. The Party's ranks and combat effectiveness had greatly developed, and the Party explicitly put forward the task of the army assisting the development of local Party organizations. However, during this period, Wang Ming and Li Lisan did not understand the characteristics and laws of armed struggle in China and made "left" opportunist mistakes, resulting in serious losses to our Party's cause. The Zunyi Conference confirmed Mao Zedong's leadership over the Party and the Red Army, and the entire Party understood the art of guiding war, allowing the Party construction and ranks to regain development. During the War of Resistance against Japan, our Party had a deep understanding of armed struggle. Along with the development of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army under Party leadership, there was unprecedented development in Party construction. As Mao Zedong pointed out, "With guns, we can indeed build a party. The Eighth Route Army has built a large party in North China." "The Party organization has emerged from a small circle and become a national party. The Party's influence among the people has also expanded." In the War of Liberation, our understanding of the laws of armed struggle and our ability to conduct revolutionary warfare reached a new stage. The number and combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army grew rapidly, eventually overthrowing the feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic comprador capitalism that ruled mainland China, and establishing the People's Republic of China. The Communist Party of China became the ruling party leading the entire country. Therefore, it can be said that the success and setbacks, progress and regress of our Party are completely tied to armed struggle. The Party's political line and Party construction are closely linked to the form of armed struggle. Without armed struggle, without revolutionary warfare, "we cannot understand our political line, nor can we understand the construction of our Party. A significant part of our political line is armed struggle."
Thirdly, the Chinese people's understanding and participation in the Chinese revolution are closely linked to armed struggle. Any social revolution is based on the full understanding and active participation of the people. And the way in which the people gain this understanding and participate reflects the characteristics, breadth, and depth of the revolution. In the proletarian revolution struggle in capitalist countries, legal and non-violent mass movements (mainly workers' movements) are both the basic means of raising the consciousness of the working masses and the main way in which they participate in the revolutionary struggle. Armed struggle can only take place when this legal struggle, the mass movement, has reached the most extensive and profound level across society.In China, the people do not have any democratic rights in politics, and 90% of the population consists of farmers who are in a closed, scattered, and small production state. It is impossible to mobilize and organize the largest masses of people to join the revolutionary ranks in a legal and peaceful manner. In the Chinese revolution, the people's understanding of and participation in the revolution are mainly linked to armed struggle. On the one hand, since armed struggle is the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution, the mobilization of the people is essentially the mobilization for revolutionary war, and the people's understanding of the revolution is initially linked to violent means. On the other hand, although the propaganda and mobilization work of the Chinese revolution is diversified, it is mainly carried out through the military. Mao Zedong has always regarded propaganda teams as an important task of the people's army. For the vast rural masses in China, their understanding of the revolution mostly comes from the propaganda teams of the armed forces such as the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, the people's understanding and level of participation in the revolution have always been proportional to the progress of the revolutionary war. Where the revolutionary war advances and wins in a certain region, the people in that region can be quickly mobilized and organized. Mao Zedong once compared the 25,000-mile Long March of the First Red Army to a propaganda team and a sowing machine, but it is said in this sense. It is in the process of armed struggle that the people come to recognize their own interests, see their own great power, and understand that only the Communist Party can lead them to victory in the revolution, thereby actively and bravely engaging in revolutionary struggle. It is also the practical education of the revolutionary armed struggle that has educated and trained the people, and ultimately liberated the people. The armed struggle in China is essentially a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat. The reasons are as follows:
First, China is a country with peasants as the main mass, with peasants accounting for 80% of the national population. Regardless of manpower or material resources, peasants are the largest and most profound source of strength for armed struggle in China. Peasants are the source of China's army, and soldiers are peasants in military uniforms.
Second, Chinese peasants suffer from multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, have no political rights, are extremely poor economically, and live in dire straits. Therefore, they have a strong desire for revolution. They are the most reliable allies of the proletariat and the main force of the Chinese revolution.
Third, China is a country with a long history and glorious tradition of peasant uprisings and peasant wars. The Communist Party of China has summarized and learned from the experience and lessons of previous peasant revolutions, inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of past peasant wars, and combined the Marxist-Leninist theory of violent revolution with the current situation and history of China, resulting in a new type of peasant revolutionary war with Chinese characteristics, which is essentially an armed struggle under the leadership of the proletariat. The main form of struggle is armed struggle, "not to say that other forms of struggle can be abandoned, on the contrary, without the coordination of various forms of struggle other than armed struggle, armed struggle cannot win." However, all the organizations and struggles before the outbreak of war are for the preparation of war.Armed struggle is unified with other forms of struggle, and armed struggle cannot be separated from other forms of struggle. Other forms of struggle must serve armed struggle. Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between armed struggle and workers' struggle, peasants' struggle, youth and women's struggle, struggles on the economic front, struggles on the anti-espionage front, struggles on the ideological front, and other forms of struggle, can the victory of the Chinese revolutionary war be facilitated.
Section 2: The Communist Party of China's Dialectical Materialism of Military Science
I. Establishing the Proletarian View of War
Zhu De once pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong systematically studied the laws of the Chinese revolutionary war. Of particular importance is Comrade Mao Zedong's development of the theoretical foundation and methodology of Marxist-Leninist military science, namely military dialectics, in his military writings." During the period of the land revolution war, the "left" adventurists studied and guided the war with dogmatism, causing disastrous consequences for the Chinese revolutionary war. This situation compelled the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong, to study the methodology of war in order to unify the party's military thinking from a world outlook. In 1936, Mao Zedong delivered a lecture titled "Military Dialectics" at the Red Army University in northern Shaanxi. The content of this lecture was mostly included in the article "The Strategic Problem of China's Revolutionary War." Afterwards, in works such as "On Protracted War," he discussed a series of important ideas about military dialectics. War: What is it?
The Communist Party of China examines war from the perspective of class struggle. It believes that wars in the recorded history of mankind, without exception, arise from the emergence of private ownership and the struggle between classes. Mao Zedong examined the peasant wars in Chinese history and said, "The cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the landlord class forced the peasants to rise up repeatedly to resist the rule of the landlord class. In Chinese feudal society, only this kind of class struggle, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the real driving force of historical development." He also examined the world's national struggles and said, "National struggles, ultimately, are a question of class struggle. In the United States, the oppressors of black people are only the reactionary ruling groups of the white race. They cannot represent the majority of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened people within the white race." These are views that adhere to the perspective of class struggle. He also said, "Due to the existence of classes, warfare has filled human life for thousands of years. Every nation has fought numerous battles, either within its own ethnic group or between ethnic groups. By the imperialist era of capitalist society, warfare has become particularly extensive and brutal." It is evident that war is a social phenomenon with class struggle. The forms of struggle between various classes in human society are diverse, including economic, ideological, cultural, diplomatic, and other forms. For the oppressed people and nations, the central task of revolution and the highest form is the armed seizure of power, the resolution of issues through war.When forms of peaceful struggle in the economic, ideological, cultural, diplomatic, and other domains fail to solve problems, resorting to force and using war to resolve conflicts becomes necessary. Therefore, war has become the highest form of solving class struggle problems, and this is an inevitable law. Mao Zedong profoundly revealed this law, proposing that "war is the highest form of struggle in dealing with contradictions between classes, nations, states, and political groups at certain stages of development since the existence of private property and classes." This is entirely scientific, accurately revealing the origins and essence of war, clearly demonstrating that war is not a phenomenon that transcends class, but rather a social phenomenon with profound class character.
The class nature of war is prominently manifested in its close relationship with politics. As early as the resolution of the Gutian Conference, Mao Zedong criticized the error of pure military viewpoints and clarified the relationship between military affairs and politics. In the article "On Protracted War," he further discusses the relationship between war and politics. Lenin had repeatedly affirmed Clausewitz's argument that war is the continuation of politics. Based on this, Mao Zedong emphasized that war is politics and that war itself is an action with political nature. The occurrence and development of any war are closely related to the social and political factors that gave rise to it, and they are all conducted for certain political purposes. For example, China's War of Resistance Against Japan was fought to achieve the political goal of expelling Japanese imperialism and building a new China that is equal and free. It was closely related to the consolidation and development of the Anti-Japanese United Front. In short, war is inseparable from politics; it is subordinate to politics and serves politics.
However, war is not equivalent to general politics; it is politics with bloodshed, politics continued by special means. When politics reaches a certain stage where it can no longer develop as before, war erupts, and the purpose of war is to remove obstacles to political development. For example, China's independence and semi-independent status were obstacles to the political development of Japanese aggression. In order to remove this obstacle, Japan launched the War of Aggression Against China. Similarly, Japan's aggression posed a barrier to the development of China's democratic revolution. To remove this obstacle, the Chinese people launched the War of Resistance Against Japan. Once Japan was expelled from China, the War of Resistance Against Japan also came to an end. It can be seen that war and politics are fundamentally connected, both being forms of class struggle, but they also have their differences. As Mao Zedong said, "Politics is the unbloody war, and war is the bloody politics." The particularity of war gives rise to its distinctive organization and methods, and the laws of war differ from the general laws of political struggle. Therefore, the viewpoint that disdains the military and neglects the study of war is also erroneous. The factors for winning a war, according to Mao Zedong's military thinking based on the principles that war is the highest form of class struggle and war is the continuation of politics, prioritize understanding the nature of war and its political foundation as the primary factors for victory. In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the advantage of his military strength aided by the United States, launched a comprehensive attack on the Liberated Areas. At that time, the temporary advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's military strength was only a temporary phenomenon, a temporary factor; the assistance from US imperialism was also a temporary factor. The anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the support of the people were the factors that consistently played a role. And in this regard, the People's Liberation Army had the advantage. The patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war was bound to gain the support of the entire people.This is the political foundation for defeating Chiang Kai-shek.
However, war is a competition of material strength. The outcome of war depends not only on the political foundation but also on military, economic, scientific and technological, and natural geographical conditions. These are all material conditions, and military strategists cannot attempt to win a war beyond the limits of material conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to create military, economic, scientific and technological, and natural environmental conditions that are favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy in order to lay the foundation for winning the war. On a certain material basis, subjective guidance becomes the decisive factor for victory in war. The stage for the activities of military strategists is built on objective material conditions, but with this stage, they can direct many magnificent and powerful dramas, using flexible and agile strategies and tactics to defeat the enemy and achieve victory in war.
Mao Zedong also pointed out: weapons are an important factor in war, and China's weapons and equipment are relatively backward, which is a major deficiency that should be improved. However, weapons are not the determining factor, and the determining factor is people, not things. That is to say, among these two factors, people are the primary, main, and dominant factor. The balance of power is not only the balance of military and economic power, but also the balance of manpower and public opinion. Military and economic power have to be grasped and created by people. The practice of the Chinese revolutionary war proves that the people are the foundation of victory, and the bravery and wisdom of the people and the army are the decisive factors that often determine the outcome of war. China's revolutionary war, in which an enemy with superior equipment was defeated by an enemy with inferior equipment, mainly relied on the people, mobilized the people, armed the people, and conducted a people's war. This is the essence of Mao Zedong's military thought theory of defeating the enemy.The way to eliminate war
War is a phenomenon unique to class society. When human society eliminates classes and states, war will also be eliminated, and human society will enter an era of permanent peace. How can this goal be achieved? Mao Zedong pointed out: there is only one method, to eliminate war through war, to eliminate counter-revolutionary war through revolutionary war, and to eliminate unjust war through just war. Lenin once said: "The nature of war (reactionary war or revolutionary war) does not depend on who attacks or whose territory the 'enemy' is on, but on which class is waging the war, and what kind of political continuation this war represents." According to the different class nature and political purposes of war, wars in history can be divided into two categories: just war and unjust war. Mao Zedong pointed out that a just war is a kind of toxin resistance, a bridge that pushes world history to a new era, and without it, the leap of social development cannot be realized; unjust war hinders social development and progress. Therefore, communists should not simply support all wars or oppose all wars, but should distinguish the nature of wars, support and participate in just wars, and oppose unjust wars. The bourgeoisie pacifists do not distinguish between the justice and injustice of war, they oppose all wars; without exploring the social roots of war, they unconditionally beg for peace from imperialism, thinking that universal peace and lasting peace can be achieved under imperialist rule, which is completely unrealistic fantasy.History has proven that in a single country or on a global scale, the only way to eliminate all wars is through the armed struggles of all peoples, to overthrow imperialism and all exploitative systems, and to establish socialist and communist systems. As Mao Zedong said, "We are advocates for the elimination of war, we do not want war; but war can only be eliminated through war, and those who do not want to use guns must pick up guns." Our study of the laws of war and our revolutionary warfare are all driven by our desire to eliminate all wars. This is the fundamental position and attitude of communists towards war. Economy is the material basis of war, as war cannot be separated from the economy. Mao Zedong said, "War not only entails military and political competition, but also economic competition." "If economic construction is not carried out, the material conditions for revolutionary warfare will not be ensured." The Chinese Communist Party has always considered economic factors as necessary conditions for defeating the enemy during the leadership of the Chinese revolution and revolutionary war. In the early stages of the revolutionary war led by the Chinese Communist Party, why could a small or several small areas of red political power persist within a country, surrounded by white political powers? Why could the revolutionary war promote the arrival of the climax of the Chinese revolution? Mao Zedong analyzed the simultaneous existence of weak capitalist economy and severe semi-feudal economy in the political and economic development of China at the time, the coexistence of modern industrial and commercial cities and stagnation in the vast rural areas, the coexistence of millions of industrial workers and tens of millions of farmers and manual laborers under the old system, the coexistence of warlords who controlled the central government and those who controlled the provinces, the existence of two parts of the reactionary army, namely the so-called central army under Chiang Kai-shek and the so-called miscellaneous army under various provincial warlords, the existence of railways, waterways, highways, and widespread roads for horse-drawn carts, roads that can only be navigated by foot, and roads that are difficult to traverse even on foot. Based on such an imbalanced economic and political development, contradictions existed and developed, such as the contradiction between imperialist powers competing for China, the contradiction between various factions of warlords within China, the contradictions formed by the heavy taxation imposed by the reactionary government on workers, farmers, and the national industrial and commercial sectors, as well as the deepening contradictions between exploited and oppressed workers, farmers, intellectuals, urban poor, and even soldiers of the reactionary army, and the ruling reactionary authorities, landlords, and bourgeoisie. It is like having dry kindling spread throughout the country, which will quickly ignite into a raging fire. These economic conditions are the most fundamental reasons why the Chinese revolution and revolutionary war were inevitable at the time. Mao Zedong's military thought, which analyzes the causes of war from an economic perspective, is scientific and has guiding significance for any war. Why do wars break out between countries of different or similar natures at present? As long as we conduct an economic analysis, it is not difficult to find the main reasons.
The economy is the material basis of war. In China, a vast but impoverished and backward country, a revolutionary war lasting 22 years was carried out, thanks to the simultaneous economic construction, development of productive forces, and adjustment of production relations during the course of the war. Mao Zedong's military thought has made important contributions to the theory of the relationship between war and the economy. Mao Zedong wrote many works, in which he expounded on the important significance of the economy to war and set out guidelines for economic work during different historical periods.He pointed out that during wartime, the focus should be on war, but economic development is also a "great class struggle". Economic construction must be carried out around war, and canceling economic construction weakens the war. The party should represent the interests of the vast majority of farmers and workers, help them develop production, implement policies of reducing rent and interest, and carry out land reforms. It is necessary to appropriately increase wages and provide tangible material benefits to the masses, stimulate their enthusiasm to support and participate in revolutionary war, and oppose enemy attacks. Otherwise, the masses will not be able to distinguish who is better between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, creating a situation unfavorable to us. Streamlining the armed forces and simplifying administration is an important policy to overcome difficulties. It makes our war institutions suitable for the war situation, and we will appear more powerful. We will not only be defeated by the enemy, but ultimately defeat the enemy. Just like Sun Wukong transforming into a small bug and drilling into Iron Fan Princess's heart, defeating the invading giant aggressor; reduction of rent and production are the two important tasks in defending the liberated areas. Whether these two tasks can be completed will ultimately determine the victory or defeat in the political and military struggle in the liberated areas, and so on. These conclusions have been proven by the practice of war and are scientifically correct. As for peacetime, what is the relationship between economic development and national defense? Mao Zedong said: "National defense is indispensable. A reliable method is to reduce the proportion of military and political expenditures and increase the cost of economic construction. Only when economic construction develops faster can national defense construction make greater progress." "Do you really want atomic bombs, do you want it very much, or do you only want it a little? If you really want it, want it very much, then reduce the proportion of military and political expenditures and focus more on economic construction. If you don't really want it, want it very much, then continue to follow the old regulations." He also said: Should we cut off all of our troops now? That's not good. Because there are still enemies, and we are still being bullied and surrounded by the enemy! We must strengthen national defense, therefore, we must first strengthen economic construction. This is the regular understanding of the relationship between peacetime economy and national defense, and it is also an important guideline for guiding national defense construction.
II. To understand and apply the laws of war truthfully. 
War is a material necessity and can be understood.
Starting from reality and making the subject conform to the objective is the basic requirement of dialectical materialism. Mao Zedong applied dialectical materialism to military affairs, and has always believed that war, like other social phenomena, is a material necessity and inevitably has internal contradictions and objective laws that are not subject to human will. The study and guidance of war must start from reality, truthfully understand and apply the laws of war. This is the basic characteristic and basic requirement of military practice. As for whether people can understand war and the laws of war, bourgeois military strategists often start from an idealistic point of view and unilaterally magnify the mobility and uncertainty of war, believing that war is elusive and attribute the outcome of war to accidental factors or "the will of God". This is agnosticism in the issue of war. Mao Zedong, based on the principles of dialectical materialism and combining with the practical experience of the Chinese revolutionary war, completely negated the agnosticism of war. He pointed out that although war has greater mobility, there is relative stability in specific stages of the overall course of war. For example, within a strategic stage, there may be certain changes in the number of battles, but the basic situation of the enemy and us will not change in nature, which is relative stability within a certain stage. The same goes for the uncertainty of war. Because both sides of the war are armed and alive, they keep secrets from each other and also create illusions to deceive each other, which creates the characteristic of uncertainty in war. However, this does not mean that the relative certainty of war should be denied.One side I am relatively certain, the other side is not very certain, but there is also a traceable connection, clues to be observed, and phenomena to be pondered before and after, which constitutes a certain degree of relative certainty. In short, although war is greatly influenced by chance, behind chance lies necessity. People can see the essence through phenomena, grasp the necessity through accidental phenomena, understand and apply the laws of war. 
A comprehensive analysis of the actual situation of both sides of the enemy and ourselves is necessary to understand and guide the laws of war.
How to understand the laws of war? Mao Zedong pointed out in his discussion on "how to study war": "There is a method that must be learned and used when studying and using. What method is it? It is to be familiar with all aspects of the situation of both sides, find out their patterns of action, and apply these patterns to one's own actions." This means that guiding war must follow the laws of war, and to understand these laws, it is necessary to objectively and comprehensively analyze and compare all aspects of the situation of both sides, and ponder the diverse and complex phenomena by getting rid of the rough to refine the essence, discarding the false to retain the truth, and considering the connections from one aspect to another, from the outside to the inside. This is the fundamental way to solve the main objective contradictions in war. Because war is the bilateral activities of hostile sides, it is a competition of strength in various aspects such as politics, economy, military, geography, and subjective guidance capabilities of both sides. The laws of war are inherent connections of these objective realities of both sides. Therefore, the study of war must take both the main subjective and objective conditions of both sides as the objects and starting points of the study, comprehensively analyze the main subjective and objective conditions of both sides, in order to correctly understand the panorama of war and find the guiding laws of war. Any research method that emphasizes one aspect in isolation and neglects others cannot correctly understand the war and the laws of war. Mao Zedong said, "There are people who are clear about themselves but unclear about others, and there are people who are clear about others but unclear about themselves. Both of them cannot solve the problem of studying and using the laws of war." He emphasized the importance of bearing in mind Sun Tzu's famous saying "Know yourself, know your enemy, and you shall not be defeated." Historical experience has confirmed that Mao Zedong's assertion is completely correct. During the period of the second domestic revolutionary war, the left-wing adventurists or right-wing opportunist committed errors because they only saw the Red Army's temporary victory and the enemy's temporary failure, or only saw the enemy's strength and the Red Army's weakness. The proponents of the theory of defeatism and quick victory during the resistance against Japan also did not objectively and comprehensively assess the situation of both sides. The proponents of defeatism only saw the weak side of ourselves and the strong side of the enemy; while the proponents of quick victory only saw our progress and the enemy's retreat, our many helping hands and the enemy's few helping hands, and denied the fact of the enemy being stronger than us. Mao Zedong, on the contrary, always comprehensively analyzed and compared the situation of both sides, not only seeing favorable conditions but also seeing unfavorable conditions, not only seeing domestic conditions but also international conditions, not only seeing the present but also focusing on development, in order to find the fundamental laws of war. During the period of the land revolution, he comprehensively analyzed the situation of both sides and found the four basic characteristics of the Chinese revolution, thereby revealing the fundamental laws of the development of the Chinese revolution, and formulating the strategic tactics of the Chinese revolutionary war. During the resistance against Japan, he also comprehensively analyzed the situation of both China and Japan, found the four contradictions in the comparison of strengths between China and Japan, and based on this, argued for the fundamental laws of the development of the resistance against Japan and formulated the strategic principles and tactics of protracted war. In order to fully and deeply understand the situation of both sides, Mao Zedong systematically elucidated the dialectical process of understanding war and the importance of investigation and research. Mao Zedong applied the principles of dialectical materialist epistemology to military affairs. He pointed out that the process of a commander's understanding of each war or each campaign includes two stages: from sensory understanding to rational understanding and from understanding to practice.
The main content of the first stage is to conduct investigations and research, form correct judgments and battle plans. The key here is the investigations and research. Mao Zedong said: "The commander's correct deployment comes from correct determination, correct determination comes from correct judgment, correct judgment comes from meticulous and necessary reconnaissance, and the coherent thinking about various reconnaissance materials." Mao Zedong pointed out that investigations and research are not only extremely important in the first stage of understanding, but also extremely important in the second stage. Because the understanding gained in the first stage needs to be reexamined in the second stage. If the situation does not match or mostly does not match, the established plans need to be revised to adapt to the new situation. This applies to the understanding process of a campaign or battle. If we want to explore the universal laws of war, we need to deepen our understanding through repeated cycles of practice to understanding and understanding to practice. Focusing on the characteristics and development of war, it is important to study the special laws of war and guide war. We should not only pay attention to comprehensive analysis of the situations of both sides, but also oppose idealism in war issues and mechanical views on war issues. Not only should we focus on studying the general laws of war, but also study the special laws of revolutionary war and the even more special laws of Chinese revolutionary war. This is a fundamental methodological principle that Mao Zedong proposed for applying the principles of generality and particularity to war.
First, from the perspective of the nature of war, revolutionary war is different from counter-revolutionary war. The nature of war is different, and the guiding laws are also different, they cannot be mechanically applied. In the early stage of land revolution war, some people in the army blindly copied the military regulations of the bourgeoisie, opposed the absolute leadership of the party over the army, opposed the execution of the Three Major Tasks by the Red Army, opposed democracy within the army, etc. The root cause of these problems is the failure to recognize the fundamental differences between the Chinese revolutionary war and counter-revolutionary war, and the differences between the proletarian army and the bourgeois army.
Second, from the perspective of the geographical regions of wars, each country and each nation, especially large countries and large nations, have their own characteristics, and therefore, the guiding laws of wars also have their own characteristics. The Chinese revolutionary war and the Russian revolutionary war belong to the same kind of war in terms of their nature. However, the national conditions and national characteristics of the two countries are different, so the guiding laws of wars are very different. Dogmatists, disregarding these differences, mechanically applied the experience of the Russian revolutionary war to China, blindly demanding "regularization" of everything, and opposing the so-called "guerrilla warfare," which resulted in serious setbacks for the land revolution war.
Third, from the perspective of time conditions, with the changes in the time conditions of war, the objective situation and tasks also change one after another, so the guiding laws of war also have their own characteristics in different historical stages. Compared with the era of cold weapons, the methods and guiding laws of war are very different in the era of hot weapons. Even for the same Chinese revolutionary war, the guiding laws are different due to different stages of war development. For example, in the later stage of the land revolution war, the then People's Liberation Army focused on mobile warfare; during the Anti-Japanese War, due to changes in the enemy situation and tasks, the People's Liberation Army shifted to guerrilla warfare as the main form of warfare; during the Liberation War, due to changes in the wartime situation, the People's Liberation Army once again achieved the military strategic transformation from the Anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare to the domestic revolutionary war. In summary, the situation of war is constantly changing, and the guiding laws of war must also change accordingly. Therefore, Mao Zedong has always emphasized the need to be good at adapting the guiding laws of war to the changing situation of war.
Section 3: The Constructive Thought of the People's Army
I. The sole purpose of the People's Army
The construction ideology of the People's Liberation Army is a new type of ideology and theoretical principle that embodies the Chinese characteristics of the construction of the people's army, which was creatively proposed by the Communist Party of China by integrating the Marxist principles of building the army with the actual revolution and army construction practice in China. 
The sole purpose of our military is to serve the people wholeheartedly.
As early as November 1927, in the "Current Situation in China and the Tasks of the Communist Party" formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the party identified the nature of the army that was being created as a "revolutionary army of workers and peasants completely different from mercenary armies". The so-called revolutionary army of workers and peasants was actually in contrast to the National Revolutionary Army. It excluded the Chinese bourgeoisie class and other classes and strata that had betrayed the revolution from the revolutionary camp, thus declaring its nature as a proletarian army and its purpose of serving the working people. In early 1929, Mao Zedong and Zhu De led the Fourth Red Army on their way to the Gan-Ning and Minxi regions, and they proposed the concept of "the purpose of the Red Army is the revolution of the people's rights" in the form of a bulletin from the headquarters of the Fourth Red Army. This was the first time our military used the concept of "purpose" and expressed its purpose. The purpose of the Red Army being the revolution of the people's rights seems to still be following Sun Yat-sen's military proposal in terms of its wording. However, because the Red Army limited the concept of "people" to "workers, peasants, and all oppressed classes," it deviated from Sun Yat-sen's original meaning of "nation," and therefore, the purpose proposed by the Red Army, which is the revolution of the people's rights, essentially aims at the emancipation of the broad laboring masses. The education of purpose is the central content of the political education of the Red Army, and the outstanding achievement of the political education of the Red Army lies in cultivating the selfless and sacrificial spirit of officials and soldiers fighting for the interests of workers and peasants.
After entering the War of Resistance against Japan, due to the change in tasks and the environment, the education of purpose in our military faced severe challenges. On the one hand, the expression of the purpose during the period of the Red Army obviously could no longer fully meet the needs of the new situation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. On the other hand, our military, which had escaped from the state of isolation during the civil war, faced the danger of being influenced and losing the fundamental revolutionary direction by various non-proletarian thoughts. In this situation, our military devoted greater efforts to purpose education. Mao Zedong and others began to explore a form of expression of the military purpose that could not only maintain the essence of the Red Army's purpose but also adapt to the requirements of the new struggle situation. In May 1942, Mao Zedong mentioned the term "serving the people" for the first time in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, explaining the fundamental purpose of our party and our military engaging in revolutionary struggles. In September 1944, in the speech "Serve the People," Mao Zedong further limited the term "serving the people" by adding the qualifiers of "completely" and "thoroughly." Based on this, in April 1945, Mao Zedong officially formed a complete, accurate, and scientific expression of the military purpose in the political report "On the United Front" of the party's Seventh National Congress: "To closely unite with the Chinese people, to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the only purpose of this army." From then on, serving the people wholeheartedly became the fundamental starting point for all actions of our military; adhering to this purpose also became an important guiding principle of the political work of our military. Under the guidance of this purpose, our military officers and soldiers can carry forward the revolutionary spirit of fearlessness of hardships and death, making our military have the heroic spirit that overwhelms all enemies; they can also share the joys and sorrows with the people, understand their needs, and build a blood relationship with the people, becoming the beloved soldiers of the people; they can always follow the Party's command in all actions, becoming models in implementing the Party's line, policy, and measures. In this way, our military can become an invincible and unbeatable heroic army. The purpose of our military is the embodiment of the class essence of the new type of people's army. The military always belongs to a certain class and serves the interests of a certain class, therefore, it inevitably has distinct class characteristics.The purpose of an army is not only its code of conduct but also the embodiment of its class nature. Our army consciously adopts "serving the people wholeheartedly" as its purpose, which demonstrates that our army is dedicated to fighting for the interests of the people and is deeply rooted in and relies on the people. Pursuing this purpose is determined by the proletarian nature of our army and is also a concentrated reflection of its proletarian nature.
Our army is a new type of people's army, which is different from those armies that serve the interests of the reactionary and decadent classes and those people's armies organized by oppressed classes or emerging exploiting classes to overthrow the decadent ruling class in history. First of all, it emerged during the period of China's new democratic revolution, aiming to achieve the goals of this revolution and to consolidate its achievements. The essence of this revolution is a bourgeois revolution led by the proletariat. Its ultimate goal is to eliminate all forms of exploitation and all exploiting classes, establishing a socialist society and eventually a communist society. As Mao Zedong pointed out, "The so-called new democratic revolution is the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat," and "This revolution precisely paves the way for the broader development of socialism." This means that China's new democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution to eliminate exploitation and the exploiting class in China. It is different from any previous revolution, as it stands on a completely new historical starting line and aims to reach a completely new historical height. The army that was born during this revolution and fights for this revolution will inevitably have a new ideological realm.Secondly, our army is a army led by the Communist Party, a armed group that carries out the party's political tasks. The Communist Party is the vanguard organization of the proletariat and is a conscious fighter for the common well-being of humanity, completely and thoroughly working for the interests of the people. It takes serving the people wholeheartedly as the purpose of the army it leads, naturally incorporating the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly into the army it leads. Furthermore, our army is armed with Marxism, using dialectical materialism and historical materialism as tools to understand the world. One of the basic principles of Marxism is that the people are the creators of history. Without the support of the people, anyone will accomplish nothing. Based on this principle of Marxism, Mao Zedong emphasized that revolutionary warfare must have the support of the people and once pointed out, "the deepest source of the greatness of war lies in the people." By making serving the people wholeheartedly the criterion for all its actions, our army conscientiously practices this basic principle of Marxism, placing itself among the people, never separating from them, and relying firmly on their support.
Wholeheartedly serving the people is the source of strength for our army. Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "On the Coalition Government" that the reason why our army has strength is that it has conscious discipline and takes serving the people wholeheartedly as its purpose.Because we uphold this aim, our army has an indomitable spirit, seeking to overpower all enemies and never be subjugated by them. Because we uphold this aim, our army maintains unity and coherence among officers and soldiers, between superiors and subordinates, and between military, political, and logistical work. Externally, our army maintains unity between the military and the people, between the military and the government, and between us and our friendly forces. Because we uphold this aim, our army has a correct policy of winning over enemy officers and soldiers and handling prisoners of war. Because we uphold this aim, our army has developed a series of strategic tactics necessary for people's war. Because we uphold this aim, our army has developed revolutionary political work necessary for people's war. Because we uphold this aim, our army consciously fulfills the tasks of production brigades.
Under the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, our officers and soldiers clearly understand that they fight for the interests of the people, including their own interests. They recognize that the cause they are engaged in is great and noble, which provides them with a strong spiritual pillar. It is precisely because of this that they possess a conscious and courageous spirit of sacrifice, being willing to give their lives to overcome the enemy, never submitting even if it means fighting to the last person. It is this spirit that has made our army a mighty and indomitable force.
Under the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, our army has a tradition of strong internal and external unity. Internally, whether it's officers, soldiers, or even cooks, everyone comes from different regions but serves the people and considers each other as class brothers. It is only on the basis of this common class interest that a new relationship between officers and soldiers can be formed. Externally, the army and the people have a mutually supportive relationship. The army considers the interests of the people above all else, always defending their interests. The people regard the army as their own offspring and provide continuous support in terms of manpower, materials, and morale. They spare no expense in supporting the troops, standing guard, patrolling, guiding, supplying food and ammunition, sheltering and rescuing the wounded, coordinating operations, and producing countless models of support for the troops. This has laid a solid foundation for the survival and development of our army. Officers love their soldiers, soldiers respect their superiors, the military loves the people, and the people support the military. This is the inexhaustible source of our army's invincible strength.
Under the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, our army can effectively undermine the enemy army. Our army can correctly differentiate between the upper and lower levels of the enemy army and carry out targeted work. Especially towards the lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the enemy army, through our actions of wholeheartedly serving the people, we make them understand that the war we are engaged in is in line with their own interests. Once they understand this, they will break away from the old camp and join our ranks. In addition, guided by the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, our army implements a humane policy towards prisoners of war, providing medical treatment to the wounded, respecting their dignity, and welcoming those who are willing to stay and bidding farewell to those who wish to leave... This series of correct policies towards prisoners effectively undermines the morale of the enemy.
Under the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, our army has formulated strategic tactics that are unique to us and necessary for people's war. These tactics are based on the support of the people, and they can only be effective with the support of the people.
Under the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, our political work in the army is guided by the principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the military and the people, and undermining the enemy army. The political work conducted based on these principles fundamentally mobilizes the intelligence and bravery of our officers and soldiers, ensures good internal and external relations of our army, and effectively undermines the enemy army.
Under the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, our army actively engages in productive activities during combat or training intervals, starting from the principle of alleviating the burden on the people. The implementation of these activities not only greatly improves the lives of our officers and soldiers, but also wins the support of the masses, making the people truly regard this army as their own.
Adhering to the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people has enabled our army to gain powerful spiritual strength and sincere support from the people. This is precisely where our army's strength lies. As Zhu De once pointed out: "Our army is the offspring of the Chinese people's revolution, and just as a son is loyal to his mother, it faithfully serves the people. Therefore, the people love and support it, help it overcome difficulties, and continuously consolidate and strengthen itself in extremely harsh environments." Performing the three major tasks is the glorious duty of our army. As the main tool of war, the natural duty of the military is to fight, without exception, both in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. However, as a people's army created by the Communist Party of China, its duty is not limited to fighting alone. From its inception, it has been tasked with the three-in-one mission of military, political, and economic tasks, which includes fighting, mass work, and fundraising. In September 1929, the "Letter of Instruction from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Front Committee of the Fourth Army of the Red Army" stated: The basic tasks of the Red Army are: "1) Mobilize the masses to struggle, implement land revolution, and establish Soviet political power; 2) Carry out guerrilla warfare, arm the peasants, and expand its own organization; 3) Expand the guerrilla areas and political influence nationwide." The letter said: "If the Red Army fails to accomplish these three tasks, it will be no different from an ordinary army." Based on the spirit of this letter, the Yan'an Conference Resolution, presided over and drafted by Mao Zedong, further stated that the Red Army is "an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks" and, in addition to annihilating enemy military forces in battle, it also has the major tasks of propagandizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and assisting the masses in establishing revolutionary political power, even including the establishment of the Communist Party's organization. If these tasks are forgotten, "it is to lose the meaning of fighting, and it is to lose the meaning of the existence of the Red Army."
During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the task of "fundraising" was changed to "production", that is, "utilizing the intervals of combat and training to engage in the production of food and daily necessities, with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency, semi-self-sufficiency, or partial self-sufficiency of the army." Mao Zedong once wrote about the great significance of the army's production self-sufficiency at that time. He pointed out: "The army's production self-sufficiency is backward and retrogressive in form but progressive and of great historical significance in essence under our conditions." It "enables our army to overcome the difficulties of living materials, improve their lives, strengthen their physical fitness, reduce the tax burdens on the people in difficulties, thereby gaining the support of the people, having the ability to support a long-term war, and being able to expand the army, thereby expanding the liberated areas, reducing the occupied areas, and achieving the ultimate goal of eliminating the aggressors and liberating the whole of China. Isn't this historical significance tremendous?" He said: "As long as our brave and capable Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, each and every one of them can not only fight and work with the masses, but also produce, we are not afraid of any difficulties. As Mengzi said: 'Invincible in the victorious and post-victorious periods of the liberation war, our army's three major tasks are popularly summarized as combat teams, work teams, and production teams. When the national liberation in 1949 is approaching, a large number of cadres are urgently needed to carry out work in the new areas. Faced with this situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to transform all the 2.1 million guerrilla forces into work teams. In Mao Zedong's report at the Second Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he pointed out: "The People's Liberation Army will always be a combat team. Even after the national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and the imperialist system still exists in the world, our army will still be a combat team." "The People's Liberation Army is also a work team... With the gradual reduction of combat, the role of the work team increases." "After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party faced the arduous task of restoring the national economy. The Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission pointed out in the "Directive on the Participation of the Army in Production and Construction in 1950" that "the People's Liberation Army is not only a defense force, but also a production force." This led to the concept of combat teams, work teams, and production teams.
The fundamental purpose of building the people's army is to serve the people. The army does whatever the people need, taking the interests of the Chinese people as the highest criterion to determine the tasks of our military in different periods. Without this point, the basic premise is lost. At the same time, the functions of the army are linked to its tasks. There are military, political, and economic tasks, long-term and current tasks, as well as basic and auxiliary tasks, and more. Our army is the most organized, conscious, and combat-effective part of the people. It can use military means to eliminate enemies, act as propagators and organizers of the people, engage in agricultural and military production, reduce people's burdens, support local development, and rescue people from natural disasters. It combines multiple tasks and serves the people in an all-round way. Of course, there is a hierarchy in the execution of the three major tasks of the people's army. As a tool for the proletarian revolution and dictatorship, the fundamental task of the people's army is combat. In different historical periods, the Party repeatedly emphasized that the people's army can only fulfill other tasks when it does not hinder the fundamental task. If this fundamental task is denied and other work is done, it is a reversal of priorities. Failure to complete the special tasks given to our army by the people fundamentally harms the interests of the people.
II. Adhere to the Party's absolute leadership over the army
The formation of the ideology of the Party's absolute leadership over the army
From the first day of having its own armed forces, the Communist Party of China attached great importance to the issue of leadership over the army. In October 1927, Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops on their way to Jinggangshan and conducted the famous "Three Bayonets Repurposing", which decided to establish party organizations at all levels in the army under the leadership of the Party's front-line committee. "Party branches are established at the company level", class and platoon establish party groups, battalion and regiment establish party committees, and party representatives are established at the level above the company. These important principles and systems laid an important organizational foundation for realizing the Party's leadership over the army. In July 1928, Zhou Enlai mentioned in his military report at the Sixth Party Congress issues such as establishing the Red Army and militarization of party members, clearly stating, "The Party should play a central role, a leadership role." The resolution on military work passed at the Sixth Party Congress also further pointed out, "All military work of the Communist Party of China should be concentrated in the Central Military Department of the Communist Party of China." In December 1929, the Fourth Red Army convened the 9th Party Congress, which passed the famous Gutian Conference resolution drafted by Mao Zedong. In response to the pure military viewpoint that is detached from the Party's leadership, it explicitly stated that "China's Red Army is an armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks", and the Party's leadership organs in the troops should become the "central hub" of leadership. It stipulated that "all work, after discussion and resolution by the Party, should be implemented through the masses", major issues should be discussed at the Party committee meeting, and "once a resolution is made, it must be resolutely implemented." This established a set of principles and measures for realizing the Party's leadership over the army from political, ideological, and organizational perspectives, and fundamentally drew a boundary between the proletarian army and all old armies, fully establishing the Red Army on the basis of Marxism, and strengthening the Party's leadership over the army. In June 1930, the Front-Line Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Political Work Outline at All Levels of the Fourth Red Army of the Red Army", as well as the "Interim Regulations for Political Work of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (Draft)" issued by the Central Party in the winter of 1930, which officially stipulated the Party's leadership over the army. Since then, the adherence to the Party's absolute leadership over the army has appeared in many official documents of our Party and army, and has also been specified in the political work regulations issued in various periods."
The principle of the Party's absolute leadership over the military is not only gradually formed and established in the practice of our army's establishment, but also deeply rooted in the foundation of Marxist theory.
Marxism tells us that the military is a product of class struggle, and it is a tool for a certain class and its political party to achieve political goals. It is subordinate to a certain class and its political party, and serves the interests of a certain class and its political party. There is no army beyond class in the world, nor is there an army beyond political parties. In modern times, the ruling class usually leads the country through its own political party and controls the military through its own political party. Of course, there are various forms in which the ruling class controls the military. For example, in capitalist countries, some control the state power and the military through their own political party, while others control them through two or more political parties taking turns in power. However, regardless of which form is used, it cannot change the essence of executing the will of the ruling class, nor can it hide the fact that the political party, the state, and the military all belong to the same class, namely the ruling class. The ruling of the bourgeoisie can never allow the proletariat to take charge of their political power and their military. Similarly, as the vanguard of the proletariat, the Communist Party must firmly grasp the leadership of the proletarian army and never share it with any other political party.
Chinese Communists have combined the basic principles of Marxism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution in long-term revolutionary struggle, greatly enriching and developing the theory of Marxism in many aspects, including class, political party, state, and military relations. Mao Zedong once pointed out, "The Party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the highest form of organization of the proletariat. It should lead all other organizations, such as the army, the government, and the mass organizations." He also said, "The Party leads everything in the aspects of labor, agriculture, commerce, education, the army, politics, and the Party." The absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the military is Mao Zedong's consistent thinking and proposition. As early as the period of the land revolution, Mao Zedong explicitly stated, "Only the Communist Party leads this revolutionary war. The Communist Party has already established an absolute leadership over the revolutionary war. This absolute leadership of the Communist Party is the most important condition for the revolutionary war to persist to the end. Without the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, it is unimaginable for the revolutionary war to have such persistence." After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, in order to strengthen the Party's absolute leadership over the military, Mao Zedong further emphasized the Communist Party's adherence to the policy of independence and self-reliance in the anti-Japanese united front, and explicitly stated: "We reject the Nationalist Party's request to send their members to serve as cadres in the Eighth Route Army and insist on the Communist Party's absolute leadership over the Eighth Route Army." In November 1938, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, he summarized the experience of the Party's insistence on the principle of independence and self-reliance in the united front since the War of Resistance and mentioned the lesson of Zhang Guozhao's overemphasis on the military, further emphasizing, "Communists should not seek personal military power (absolutely not, never learn from Zhang Guozhao), but should strive for the Party's military power and the people's military power." "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and under no circumstances can the gun command the Party." This is the most vivid summary of Mao Zedong's principle of the Party's absolute leadership over the military. In October 1947, he reiterated in the "Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army": "All soldiers of our army must always remember that we are the great People's Liberation Army, the team led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the Party's instructions, we will definitely win." And indeed, this is the case.For several decades, one of the most important reasons why our military has been able to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and from victory to victory is that it has always been under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. The necessity of adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military is twofold. 
Firstly, the Party's absolute leadership over the military is the fundamental guarantee of the proletarian nature of our military. In the specific context of the Chinese revolution, emphasizing the Party's absolute leadership over the military can effectively transform a predominantly peasant army into a proletarian army. The revolutionary war in China, which took place in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, was essentially a peasant war led by the proletariat. The main composition of the revolutionary army inevitably consisted of peasants who, as oppressed individuals, especially those deeply oppressed under the "three mountains," had strong revolutionary consciousness and a strong desire to overthrow the social system that caused their suffering. However, as small-scale producers, they were often influenced by the petit-bourgeois worldview, with narrow perspectives, a lack of foresight, and a tendency towards extremism. In order to transform a predominantly peasant army into a truly proletarian revolutionary army, it is necessary to use the proletarian worldview to reform this army and the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat to constrain it. All of this can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, as only the Communist Party can implement the proletarian revolutionary worldview within the army and establish proletarian revolutionary discipline, thus effectively overcoming the various influences of petit-bourgeois worldviews that arise from the peasant composition of the army, and making the army fight completely and thoroughly for the interests of the people. Mao Zedong stated in his report on the political work of the Political Department of the Garrison Army in the Northwest Bureau at the High-Ranking Cadre Meeting: "It is unimaginable for our army to be without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the revolutionary military work and political work led by the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, it is impossible to have military work and political work that completely supports the interests of the people, and without this kind of army that carries out military and political work, it is impossible to have an army that completely supports the interests of the people."
Secondly, only by adhering to the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China can our military fulfill the historical tasks of the Chinese revolution. This is determined by the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China over the revolutionary war. The practice of the Chinese revolution has shown that only the proletariat and the Communist Party of China can overcome the narrowness of the peasant class, the petit-bourgeois class, and the national bourgeoisie, and lead the revolution and the war towards victory. The Party's leadership over the entire war determines its leadership over the military. The Communist Party represents the interests of the broad masses of the people and can therefore mobilize and support the masses to participate in and support its own army, thus providing the war with abundant human and material resources. The Communist Party educates the army with the proletarian worldview, enabling all soldiers to have a profound understanding of the laws of social development, to hate all exploitative systems, and to establish a lofty ideal of striving for communism and a wholehearted dedication to serving the people. As a result, the military has a high degree of political awareness, excellent internal and external unity, a thorough revolutionary spirit, indomitable courage, and unwavering fighting spirit. Therefore, it can be invincible and victorious in the revolutionary war. The Communist Party, with its strict organization, discipline, and exemplary role, makes its various levels of organization the core of unified leadership and united combat, thus making the military an invincible and indomitable fighting collective and an impregnable steel fortress that cannot be shaken by any individual ambitious person or conspirator. The Communist Party, guided by the scientific theory of Marxism, timely points out the correct political direction for the military and formulates flexible and maneuverable strategies and tactics.The Chinese revolutionary war was a long and complex one, with the people's army often in difficult positions. However, due to the correct political and military leadership of the party, it eventually transformed from weak to strong and defeated all powerful enemies, both domestic and foreign.
Finally, the steadfast adherence to the party's absolute leadership over the military is the fundamental guarantee for the development and victory of our army. Our army was born on August 1, 1927. During the period of the land revolution war, it was known as the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. During the anti-Japanese war, it was reorganized as the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. During the liberation war, it became the People's Liberation Army. The development and growth of our army, from nonexistence to existence, from small to large, from weak to strong, are all the results of the correct leadership and command of the party. The third "left" opportunist error and Zhang Guozhong's right opportunism opposite to the party's leadership once caused a loss of nine-tenths of the Red Army and the revolutionary bases. The party and Mao Zedong resolutely opposed these "left" and right opportunism, insisting on the correct guidance of Marxism-Leninism for the army and upholding the correct military line, thus ensuring the growth and strength of our army and achieving victory after victory. In particular, the Zunyi Conference established Mao Zedong's leadership position in the Red Army and the party central committee, rescuing both the party and the Red Army during a critical moment. Afterwards, under the correct leadership of the party, the Red First Front Army broke through encirclement and interception by the enemy, overcame unprecedented difficulties and obstacles, and successfully completed the 25,000-li Long March, creating a miracle in human history. In the war against Japanese aggression, the disparity of strength between the enemy and us was extremely pronounced, and the struggle environment was extremely harsh. Our party formulated the guidelines and strategies for conducting independent and self-reliant guerrilla warfare against the Japanese, leading our army to advance into enemy-occupied areas, mobilizing and unleashing the masses, and engaging in protracted people's war. Finally, we broke the myth of invincibility of Japanese imperialism. After defeating the Japanese invaders, the Central Committee of the Party and Mao Zedong commanded our army to engage in an unprecedented scale of liberation war against the Nationalist Party army, which took only a little over three years to annihilate the eight million reactionary troops of the Nationalists and achieve the victory of liberating the entire China. The facts eloquently prove that the establishment and development of the People's Liberation Army of China are entirely attributed to the Communist Party of China, which created, nurtured, and commanded our army. The insistence on the party's absolute leadership over the military must be achieved through politics, ideology, organization, and institutions. In the long-term revolutionary struggle practice, in order to strengthen the party's absolute leadership over the military, our party gradually formed a complete set of effective fundamental systems and measures to lead the army. This is the scientific crystallization of our party's leadership experience over the military, and it must be seriously upheld. 
Politically, the party's absolute leadership over the military is realized through the leadership of the party's program, line, policies, and guidelines. Our army is a tool to realize the party's political program and line. Only by resolutely implementing the party's line, policies, and guidelines can we maintain the correct direction of military development, unify the thinking and actions of the entire army, correctly handle the relationship between military construction and the party's central work, and make the army truly become an armed group that obeys and serves the party's program, line, policies, better serving the realization of the party's political tasks. Therefore, the party has stipulated that within the military, only the party's program, line, policies, and guidelines can be propagated, and the vast majority of officers and soldiers must be mobilized and organized to struggle for the realization of the party's program, line, policies, and guidelines. If various political opinions are allowed to be freely propagated within the military, it would create chaos, and even cause the military to lose its direction and detach from the party's leadership.The party has formulated a series of principles for the establishment of the army in order to achieve political leadership over the military. These principles include adhering to the purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people and the principle of the party commanding the gun; adhering to the education of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the party's line, principles, and policies in the army; implementing the three major tasks of combat teams, work teams, and production teams; adhering to the three disciplines and eight points of attention; implementing political, military, and economic democracy; implementing the principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the military and the people, and the disintegration of enemy forces; abiding by the three disciplines and eight points of attention; selecting and appointing cadres based on a combination of virtue and talent; strengthening the construction of party organizations in the military and playing the core leadership role of the party committee; the role of the party branch as a bastion of combat and the vanguard and exemplary role of communist party members; and establishing political work systems, among others. In the long-term revolutionary struggle, it is precisely by adhering to these principles for the establishment of the army that the party has ensured that the military always remains an armed group that carries out the party's political tasks.
In terms of ideology, the party achieves absolute leadership over the military by adhering to the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the guiding ideologies of our party, country, and military, and they are the theoretical foundation for achieving the party's absolute leadership over the military. This is because the party's program, line, principles, policies, and the series of principles for the establishment of the army are all products of the combination of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the actual situation of the country and the military. Only by arming the military with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can the military have a common ideological foundation with the party, follow the party's command in all actions, improve the ability of officers and soldiers to identify and resist various non-proletarian ideological erosion, and maintain the purity of the military's ideology. In order to achieve ideological leadership over the military, the party has established a complete set of ideological and political work in the military, and timely conducts various forms of political education according to the development and changes of the situation and the actual needs of the military. Through these forms of education, the party truly achieves ideological leadership over the military.
In terms of organization, the party achieves absolute leadership over the military by establishing party organizations at all levels in the military under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. These party organizations serve as the unified leadership and core of unity in the military, concentrating the highest leadership and command authority of the military in the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, thereby achieving the party's absolute leadership over the military. The political work regulations of our military stipulate that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China. The highest leadership authority and highest command authority of the military belong to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission." According to this organizational principle, only the Communist Party and its assistant, the Communist Youth League, can establish party and youth organizations, develop party and youth members, and carry out work in the military; only party organizations can appoint leaders at all levels of the military. Without the approval of the corresponding political organs, military members are not allowed to join other political parties and religious organizations, establish groups and organizations outside the regulations, or participate in local mass organizations without authorization. The party's leadership over the military in terms of organization is the organizational guarantee for the party's leadership over the military. In order to achieve the party's leadership over the military in terms of organization, the party has adopted a series of organizational measures. Through these organizational measures, the party aims to achieve absolute leadership over the military from an organizational perspective.
In terms of systems, it is the principle of unified leadership by the party committee under the system of division of labor and responsibilities among leaders. This is a fundamental system for adhering to the party's absolute leadership over the military. The unified leadership of the party committee, the collective leadership of the party committee, and the division of labor and responsibilities among leaders are three inseparable and organic components that cannot be separated from each other. This system of division of labor and responsibilities among leaders under the collective leadership of the party committee combines the play of collective experience and wisdom with the activation of individual initiative and creativity. It can not only avoid the one-sidedness and possible mistakes of individual decision-making, but also prevent the phenomenon of relying on the collective for everything and no one taking responsibility.Therefore, it can ensure the implementation of the party's instructions and resolutions, and the completion of the tasks entrusted by the party.
III. Principles of Political Work
The founding ideology of the Communist Party of China not only emphasizes the importance of political work, but also summarizes the experience of our military's political work and systematically puts forward principles for our military's political work. Mao Zedong said, "Based on the people's war, on the basis of unity between the army and the people, unity between commander and fighter, and principles such as disintegration of the enemy army, the People's Liberation Army has established its own powerful revolutionary political work."
The basic content and requirements of the Three Principles were initially put forward during the Sanwan Reorganization and the struggle in Jinggangshan. In September 1927, when Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, he proposed the break-up of the feudal mercenary system and warlordism in the military, and the implementation of a democratic system. It was stipulated that officers were not allowed to physically punish soldiers, soldiers had the freedom to speak at meetings, soldiers' committees were established at the unit level and above to supervise economic expenditures, and to supervise and criticize cadres. This democratic system, based on complete political equality between officers and soldiers, became the initial content of the principle of unity between officers and soldiers. In October 1927, Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising soldiers to Jinggangshan, where he successively raised the Three Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention, and put forward the tasks for the army to fight, work with the masses, and raise funds. He demanded that our army respect the interests of the masses and abide by their discipline in order to achieve unity and common struggle between the military and the people. This was the initial requirement of unity between the military and the people. After the Autumn Harvest Uprising Army established the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Base, the enemy forces from Hunan and Jiangxi frequently organized suppression campaigns. The way in which prisoners of war were treated during the battles between the Autumn Harvest Uprising Army and the enemy forces influenced the recognition of the enemy officers and soldiers towards our army and the way our army ultimately defeated the enemy. In February 1928, Mao Zedong laid down three policies for handling prisoners of war: prisoners of war should not be beaten, scolded, killed, abused, discriminated against, or searched, and they should receive the same treatment politically and in their daily lives as our soldiers; voluntary principle of stay or leave, welcome those who choose to stay and provide travel expenses to those who choose to leave; provide treatment for wounded and sick prisoners of war. These three policies became the basic points of our military's policy towards prisoners of war. Treating prisoners of war well was also the main way our military used to disintegrate the enemy forces. The basic content and requirements of the aforementioned three aspects were further confirmed in the resolutions of the Gutian Conference. The resolutions called for the establishment of a new type of relationship between officers and soldiers, between the military and the people, and the correct policy towards prisoners of war. The old management system and methods of leading troops were abolished, thereby gradually improving the principles of political work. On October 25, 1937, during a conversation with British journalist Edgar Snow, Mao Zedong officially summarized the principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the military and the people, and disintegration of the enemy forces as the three basic principles of our military's political work.
Regarding the principle of unity between officers and soldiers, Mao Zedong pointed out: "This means eradicating feudalism in the army, abolishing the system of physical punishment, establishing conscious discipline, and living a life of shared hardship, thus unifying the entire army." The unity between officers and soldiers is the solid foundation for our army to overcome various difficulties and powerful enemies. By adhering to this principle, our army can completely eradicate the remnants of feudal employment and warlordism, implement political equality between upper and lower ranks, unify, and fight together in a spirit of unity, friendship, shared hardship, and common struggle. The concept of the relationship between officers and soldiers is broad, not only including the main relationship between officers and soldiers, but also the relationships between superiors and subordinates, units, and departments. Due to the fact that the relationship between officers and soldiers is the most fundamental relationship within the military, the principle of unity between officers and soldiers serves as a fundamental criterion for dealing with various internal relations of the military. In this relationship, soldiers are the foundation and cadres are the leaders.To educate cadres, it is necessary to first care for and love the soldiers, treat them as class brothers, and fully tap into their enthusiasm and creativity. At the same time, soldiers should also be educated to respect and cherish the cadres, willingly obey management and command, and from a perspective of care, help the cadres correct their faults and mistakes, promote internal unity, and form a strong cohesive force. Mao Zedong pointed out, "By establishing conscious discipline and implementing a life of sharing joys and sorrows, the entire army is united."
The principle of unity of the people's army is not just a good wish or slogan, but it is guaranteed by a democratic system. This democratic system generates tremendous power. During the period of the Jinggangshan, the material living conditions for the Red Army were extremely difficult, and battles were frequent, but they were able to maintain their unity. This was not only due to the role of the Party but also because of the implementation of democracy within the army. Officers did not beat or scold soldiers, there was equal treatment between officers and soldiers, soldiers had the freedom to speak at meetings, cumbersome formalities were abolished, and economic affairs were made public. Those new prisoners of war felt that the Nationalist Army and the Red Army were two different worlds. Despite the fact that the material living conditions in the Red Army were not as good as in the Nationalist Army, their spirits were liberated. Therefore, the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday became brave in the Red Army today. In this regard, Mao Zedong pointed out, "Not only does China need democracy, but so does the army. The democratic system within the army will be an important weapon to destroy feudal mercenary armies." He also said that the army should "implement a certain degree of democratization" and "that will increase its tremendous combat power, and long-term cruel wars will not suffer from being unable to sustain." During the period of the War of Liberation, the democratic system of the people's army further developed into the three major democracies of politics, economy, and military affairs. Political democracy means that soldiers and the masses can exercise their democratic rights in order to achieve a high degree of political unity. Economic democracy means that soldiers elect representatives who have the right to assist (but not surpass) the company commander in managing the company's provisions and meals in order to improve their living conditions. Military democracy means that during training, officers teach soldiers and soldiers teach each other; during combat, under the guidance of company commanders, soldiers and the masses engage in discussions on combat methods, bring out the intelligence and talent of officers and soldiers, in order to improve technical tactics. The implementation of the three major democracies ensures better implementation of the principle of unity among officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, effectively guaranteeing the victory of the war.
[Omission] Mao Zedong pointed out, "The relationship between cadres and soldiers should be close and they should integrate as one. The relationship between the army and the people, and between the army and local party and government organizations should also be close." "The army must be in harmony with the people, so that the army is seen as their own by the people, making it invincible in the world." Emphasizing the principle of unity between the military and the people requires political work to guarantee the unity of the military and the government, and the military and the people. Guided by this principle, the military always respects the people's government, cherishes the people's interests, strictly adheres to discipline, alleviates the economic burden on the people, supports the people, abides by local policies and regulations, respects local cadres, enhances military-civilian unity, and jointly fights against the enemy. By adhering to this basic principle of handling the military-civilian relationship correctly, political work can ensure the harmonious relationship between the military and the people, gain the support of the masses and local governments, and achieve victory in the people's war.During the early stages of our army, we regarded the implementation of the three major tasks and the three major disciplines and the six points of attention as specific actions to implement military-civilian unity. On October 1, 1943, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions, demanding that the people's army hold a large-scale "support for the government and love for the people" campaign in January of the following year. Correspondingly, the governments and people of the anti-Japanese base areas were required to carry out a large-scale "support the army and prioritize resistance" movement (that is, to give preferential treatment to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers) and to institutionalize it. During this campaign, both the military and civilians formulated and revised the contracts for supporting the government and loving the people, and supporting the army and prioritizing resistance. They held joint celebrations, self-evaluated and criticized their own shortcomings. This was a new creation in implementing the principle of military-civilian unity, a good form of close military-civilian relations and the correct handling of military-civilian contradictions. It further united the military and civilians in the anti-Japanese base areas. Today, the annual activities of supporting the government and loving the people and supporting the army and prioritizing resistance around the Chinese New Year are still a mass system in our country.
Regarding the principles of disintegrating the enemy's army and treating prisoners kindly, Mao Zedong pointed out, "Our victory relies not only on our own military operations, but also on the disintegration of the enemy's army." Therefore, the People's Army has a correct policy for winning over enemy officers and soldiers and dealing with prisoners. "We welcome those who surrender, those who are correcting their mistakes, and those who, after laying down their weapons, are willing to participate in the fight against the common enemy, and provide them with appropriate education. All prisoners are not allowed to be killed, abused, or insulted." This principle requires our army to conduct political propaganda and organizational disintegration of the enemy's army politically, ideologically, organizationally, and psychologically while engaged in combat. It fully utilizes various forms such as battlefield slogans, distribution of propaganda materials, and penetration of the enemy's interior to launch political offensives, shake their morale, and weaken their combat power. Implementing a good policy towards prisoners, all those who surrender, correct their mistakes, or lay down their weapons are respected and treated with magnanimity. Those who join our army are welcomed, and the enemy's strength is weakened to the greatest extent while strengthening our own strength. As early as the Jinggang Mountains period, the Red Army made four regulations for treating prisoners kindly: firstly, not to beat, scold, kill, or abuse prisoners; secondly, not to search the prisoners' belongings; thirdly, to provide treatment for the injured; fourthly, to release the prisoners, allowing them to leave voluntarily or stay on, and those who choose to stay are welcomed and can join the proletarian revolutionary army. In all the wars, our army has always launched powerful political offensives against the enemy using various means of propaganda to complement the military offensives. Due to the serious implementation of the principle of disintegrating the enemy's army, the combatants' fighting power has been effectively weakened. During the period when the Red Army faced the first to fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaigns by the Central Revolutionary Base, it annihilated 514,000 enemy troops, of which 198,000 were taken as prisoners, accounting for 38.5%. During the Anti-Japanese War, under the influence of militarism and the strong spirit of Bushido, the Japanese soldiers who received education had the choice to join the ranks of the war against aggression under the influence of the People's Army's policy of treating prisoners kindly. They formed organizations such as the "Anti-War Alliance" and the "Awakening Alliance" to fight alongside the Chinese people against Japanese aggression. In the Liberation War, our army wiped out over 8 million Kuomintang troops, of which a total of 6.36 million were taken as prisoners, surrendered, defected, or went through reorganization, accounting for 79% of the total number of enemies annihilated. These facts vividly illustrate the importance of the principle of disintegrating the enemy's army.
The principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between military and civilian, and disintegration of the enemy's army are the basic principles of political work in the people's army, which are also derived from the purpose of the people's army. First and foremost, the people's army comes from and serves the people. It has no special interests of its own. The political foundation between the military and civilians is based on common interests. Both officers and soldiers are united for a common goal. Therefore, the military and civilians, as well as the officers and soldiers of the people's army, should and can achieve unity.Secondly, revolutionary warfare primarily relies on the support of the masses and the soldiers to achieve victory. Therefore, it does not allow its army to stand above the people, nor does it allow officers to stand above the soldiers. Instead, it must practice unity between the military and the civilians and between officers and soldiers. The principles of disintegrating enemy forces and treating prisoners well are inseparable from the class nature of the people's army. The people's army fights just wars against unjust wars, firmly believing that truth can persuade people and counterrevolutionary armies can be disintegrated. The majority of the enemy soldiers who serve the reactionary class are mostly coerced workers and peasants. Therefore, the people's army should not mistreat and kill enemy officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons. Instead, it should implement revolutionary humanitarianism, extend generous treatment towards them, strive to get them to stand on the side of just wars, and through such actions, encourage the officers and soldiers within the enemy forces to awaken to the unjust nature of the war. Therefore, disintegrating enemy forces and treating prisoners well are not strategies for the people's army, but rather the fundamental principles for its struggle against the enemy.
Mao Zedong pointed out that the relationship between the military and the civilians, and the relationship between officers and soldiers, is not an issue of methods but a fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose) problem. The three major principles "must be implemented effectively, starting from the fundamental attitude of respecting soldiers, respecting the people, and respecting the dignity of the enemy soldiers who have laid down their weapons." This democratic spirit is unique to the proletarian revolutionary army. All reactionary armies have no common interests with the masses and exist in a contradictory opposition to them. Therefore, externally, there is antagonism between the military and the civilians, and internally, there is antagonism between officers and soldiers. They cannot treat soldiers and the people with a democratic attitude; they can only resort to deception and coercion. They often subject enemy prisoners of war to mistreatment and slaughter. All of this is inseparable from the class nature of these reactionary armies. Without doing so, they would not be able to have the majority of the officers and soldiers who come from the working people engage in anti-people activities, and their armies would not serve as tools for the reactionary class. The three major democracies are vivid manifestations of the mass line in the construction of the army. Since its establishment, Mao Zedong has emphasized the implementation of the mass line and the promotion of internal democracy within the military. He pointed out that not only does China need democracy, but the military also needs democracy. The democratic system within the military will be an important weapon for destroying feudal mercenary armies. He personally established soldier committees, implemented political and economic equality between officers and soldiers, and established a new democratic and united relationship within the people's army. In the resolutions of the Gutian Conference, he further established the principle of "politically, conducting democratic life under the guidance of centralized leadership" for the Red Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he further pointed out that internal military democracy is an important factor in persevering with protracted war. With the establishment of the internal democratic system, the goal of unity between officers and soldiers is achieved, and the army greatly increases its combat effectiveness, making it capable of enduring long and brutal wars. During the Liberation War, he further summarized the experiences of our army and wrote the article "Democratic Movements Within the Military," which made profound discussions on the purpose and methods of internal military democracy. He pointed out that "the political work principle within the army is to let soldiers, masses, commanders, and all personnel participate in democratic movements under centralized leadership, and achieve three major goals: political unity, improved living conditions, and enhanced technical and tactical capabilities." Political democracy means equality and unity between officers and soldiers. Through criticism and self-criticism, political unity is achieved. Economic democracy means that representatives elected by the soldiers have the right to assist (not exceed) the company commander in managing rations and supplies for the company, implementing economic transparency, and achieving the goal of improving living conditions. Military democracy means the mass line in military affairs. During training, there is mutual teaching between officers and soldiers and between soldiers. During combat, under the guidance of company commanders, soldiers are encouraged to discuss tactical and technical issues. It can be seen that the three major democracies are vivid manifestations of the mass line in the construction of our army.
Implementing internal democracy in the military requires correctly handling the relationship between democracy and centralization. Our military is a highly centralized and unified combat collective. We not only need democracy, but also centralization. Mao Zedong pointed out that this is a contradiction within a unified whole. They are contradictory but also unified. We should not unilaterally emphasize one aspect and negate the other. We should promote internal military democracy while preventing extreme democratization and anarchism. We should emphasize centralization while opposing warlordism and commandism. In short, the military democracy we implement is democratic under centralized guidance, which fundamentally differs from bourgeois democracy.The Three Rules and Eight Attentions are important guarantees for the unity and combat effectiveness of our military. Discipline ensures the implementation of the Party's line. The strict discipline of the People's Army is built on the foundation of political unity and high consciousness among all the officers and soldiers. It is a revolutionary discipline that serves the fundamental interests of the people, fundamentally distinct from the discipline of the old army. Mao Zedong formulated the Three Rules and Eight Attentions for the military, which serve as the basic guidelines for the actions of the entire army and fully reflect the essence of the People's Army consciously safeguarding the interests of the masses.
When formulating military discipline, the Party has two fundamental starting points: to safeguard the interests of the people and to consolidate and improve the fighting capability of the troops. 
As early as September 1927, after the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, Mao Zedong demanded that the soldiers of the uprising treat the people with courtesy, engage in fair trade, not loot or beat people, and not curse at them. In October, Mao Zedong addressed some disciplinary issues with the uprising troops and announced three rules: ① Obey orders; ② Do not take a single sweet potato from the masses; ③ Confiscate the wealth of the bourgeoisie. The implementation of these three rules effectively enhanced the unity between the army and the people. After the troops entered Jinggang Mountain and engaged in continuous marching and dispersed activities, disciplinary issues arose. In early January 1928, when the Red Army captured Suichuan County, Mao Zedong summarized the experience of working with the masses and subsequently proposed six attentions: ① Close the doors properly; ② Tie the straw mats; ③ Speak politely; ④ Trade fairly; ⑤ Return borrowed items; ⑥ Compensate for damages. By April 1928, when the uprising troops arrived at Shatian Village in Guidong County, Hunan Province, Mao Zedong officially announced the Three Rules and Six Attentions to all officers and soldiers, changing the phrase "Do not take a single sweet potato from the masses" to "Do not take anything from the workers and peasants." In 1929, when Mao Zedong led the Fourth Red Army in marching into southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, he expanded the six attentions to eight attentions, adding "Avoiding bathing and women" and "Do not search the prisoners' belongings." Later, based on the development of the situation and the practical experience of the troops, the phrase "Do not take anything from the workers and peasants" was changed to "Do not take anything at all from the masses." The phrase "Confiscate the wealth of the bourgeoisie" was changed to "Do not beat or curse people" and "Do not damage crops." "Avoiding bathing and women" was changed to "Do not harass women." "Do not search the prisoners' belongings" was changed to "Do not mistreat prisoners." In October 1947, when the Liberation War entered a critical stage of strategic counterattacks, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, along with Mao Zedong, revised and unified the content of the Three Rules and Eight Attentions after soliciting the opinions of various troops. The General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Jiexing, Shaanxi Province, promulgated Mao Zedong's draft of the "Directive on the Reissue of the Three Rules and Eight Attentions," which required the entire army to "deepen education" and "strictly implement" the rules.
The "Three Rules and Eight Attentions" primarily regulate the political discipline, military discipline, and mass discipline of the People's Army, embodying the disciplinary characteristics of the People's Army.
Political discipline standardizes the political behavior and speech of soldiers, adjusts the relationship between the military and classes and their political parties, and serves as an important guarantee for which class and its political party the military serves and which class and its political party it follows. "Obey orders in all actions" is the most important rule of political discipline.When Mao Zedong led the Autumn Harvest Uprising army to carry out the Sanwan reform, he started to establish party organizations and a party representative system within the military, and established the principle of "building party branches at the company level". One month later, he proposed the Three Main Rules of Discipline, with the first rule being to obey all commands. Although the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" underwent several revisions, this rule remained and was listed as the first rule. It clearly reflects the nature of the people's army and its dedication to serving the people wholeheartedly, as well as the principle that the party commands the gun and never allows the gun to command the party. "Obey all commands" means that the military should first and foremost obey the command of the party and be subordinate to party leadership. The People's Liberation Army of China is a people's army created and led by the Communist Party of China, and its leaders at all levels fulfill their responsibilities and complete tasks under the leadership of party organizations at the corresponding levels. Therefore, obeying the command of the party and the command of the administrative leaders are consistent.
The Three Main Rules of Discipline constitute the system of disciplinary content in the People's Liberation Army. They are the norms for soldiers' actions in military operations and are the important guarantee for the military to complete training, guard duty, preparedness, and other tasks during peacetime, as well as combat missions during wartime. Strengthening and improving combat effectiveness is the starting point and ultimate goal of all work in the people's army. Therefore, the military must have the strictest military discipline and must strengthen military discipline. "Obey all commands," "turn in all confiscated items to the public," and "do not mistreat prisoners of war" – resolutely implementing these disciplines will play a significant role in cultivating the concept of organizational discipline within the troops, implementing prisoner of war policies, and undermining the enemy's forces. As revolutionary soldiers, to be loyal to our duties and dedicate ourselves to the national defense cause, we must consciously cultivate our professional discipline, that is, military discipline.
Mass discipline is the standard for adjusting the behavior of the military-civilian relationship. The People's Liberation Army is a people's army with the sole purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. The nature and purpose of the people's army determine that it must be deeply rooted among the people, sharing joys and sorrows with them, blending together like milk and water, and being closely connected with them. Strict adherence to mass discipline without any infractions is the precious family treasure of the people's army for achieving victory in battles.
The "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," a total of eleven provisions, include eight provisions related to mass discipline. For example, "not taking a single needle or thread from the masses," "speaking politely," "fair trade," "borrowing things must be returned," "compensating for damaged items," "no beating or cursing," "not damaging crops," and "not harassing women" – these prominently reflect the fundamental stance and attitude of the people's army to be for the people, to love the people, and to respect the people.
Political discipline, military discipline, and mass discipline are all important parts of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and are interconnected as a whole. Political discipline plays a leading role, as it is fundamental and directional, constraining and influencing the implementation of other disciplines. Military discipline is the main body of military discipline, and mass discipline is determined by the nature of the people's army.
Section 4: The Concept of People's War
I. The unity of the army and the people is the foundation of victory.
The people's war ideology of the Communist Party of China is based on the firm belief that the masses are the decisive force in revolutionary warfare and represents the fundamental interests of the broad masses. It combines the basic principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism with China's war practice and is the most comprehensive embodiment of the Party's mass line in revolutionary warfare.
Historical materialism holds that the masses are the creators of world history and the decisive force in human social activity, development, and change. All major social activities cannot be separated from the participation of the masses, and the ultimate outcome is also determined by the will and strength of the masses. Mao Zedong summarized this idea concisely as: "Only the people, only the people, are the driving force behind the creation of world history." He creatively applied this idea to the field of warfare, laying a solid foundation for the theory of people's war. As early as the period of the land revolution and war, Mao Zedong pointed out: "What is the real impregnable fortress? It is the masses, the millions of people who sincerely support the revolution. This is the real impregnable fortress that no power can break, absolutely unbreakable. Counter-revolutionaries cannot defeat us, but we must defeat the counter-revolutionaries. By uniting millions of people around the revolutionary government and developing our revolutionary war, we can eliminate all counter-revolutionaries and we can seize the entire China." During the War of Resistance against Japan, facing the rampant aggression of Japanese imperialism, Mao Zedong, with the strategic vision of a proletarian revolutionary, pointed out that the greatest strength of warfare lies within the masses. Japan dares to bully us mainly because of the disorganized state of the Chinese people. Once this weakness is overcome, we will stand up against the Japanese invaders with tens of millions of people, making them like a buffalo rushing into a fire, and even a shout from us will scare them. This buffalo must be burned to death. At the beginning of the Liberation War, Mao Zedong pointed out distinctly: "What determines the outcome of the war is the people."
The reason why the masses are the source of war power is because, as a special process of human social activity, war ultimately cannot do without the participation of the masses. The masses are the source of manpower in war. Manpower is the foundation of war power. One of the important conditions for the strength of military forces is the numerical advantage of the army. War history shows that when two warring parties have similar quality, the one with numerical advantage has a greater chance of victory. People are the source of troops, and troops cannot be firm without the people. To establish an army with a numerical advantage, the masses are the source of troops. The reason why our army was able to achieve victory in past revolutionary wars is mainly because the masses were able to continuously supply fresh strength to the troops. In the Liaoshen Campaign, the land reform peasants in the northeast eagerly joined the army and fought, forming 80 second-line corps and supplying about 300,000 troops continuously. In the Huaihai Campaign, the Communist Party of China mobilized 168,000 people to join the army, ensuring the victory of the decisive battle. Marshal Chen Yi enthusiastically praised the great power of the masses and wrote in his book "Observations from the Front Lines of the Huaihai": "Hundreds of thousands of workers are unable to pass through, strong horses and high carts deliver food, following the army as it rotates from east to west, competing to achieve outstanding merits on the front lines." General Su Yu praised the people as the "inexhaustible source" of the people's army's victory over the enemy.
The people are the source of material resources for war. War is a competition of material strength, and without certain material conditions, war cannot be waged. The most abundant source of material resources for war comes from the people.The people are the producers of war materials. War, as a unique social activity of humans, objectively requires people to invest certain manpower and resources in the production of combat materials for war. With the development of war, the demand for resources continues to increase. In a certain sense, whoever can produce more advanced weapons and equipment, store more combat materials, and support a longer duration of combat, will win the war. The massive demand for resources in war cannot be separated from the production of resources by the people. The people are not only the producers of war materials, but also the suppliers who transport these materials to the front lines. In the three major battles of Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin fought by our army, over 5 million people were mobilized as supply workers, more than 100,000 stretchers and 380,000 carts were used, 1 million head of livestock were employed, and 9.5 billion catties of grain were consumed. The people overcame various difficulties and used backward transportation tools to transport a large amount of combat materials to the front lines, meeting the needs of the war. Mao Zedong once sighed, "Our liberation war was mainly won by the 160 million people in the north. As long as we rely on the people and firmly believe in the creativity of the masses, we trust the people and unite with the people, then we can overcome any difficulties and no enemy can overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us."
The strength of war also lies in the support of the people's hearts. The outcome of war is undoubtedly not only dependent on certain manpower and material support, but also on the support of the people. Whether it is a just or unjust war, it is closely related to the interests of the masses. The different purposes of war determine people's attitude toward war. How the people view war also determines the extent to which they contribute manpower and resources to the war, the degree of their conscious initiative in the war, and their ability to overcome war difficulties and persevere in combat, ultimately determining the outcome of the war. Mao Zedong once pointed out: the superiority of Chiang Kai-shek's military power is only a temporary phenomenon, and only a temporary factor; the support from American imperialism is also a temporary factor; the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the support of the people's hearts are factors that constantly come into play; and in this regard, the People's Liberation Army has the advantage. The patriotic and just revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war is bound to win the support of the people nationwide. This is the political basis for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. Mao Zedong clearly revealed the development laws of war by emphasizing that the justice of war determines the support of the people's hearts, and the support of the people's hearts is a factor that frequently comes into play. Zhu De also affirmed this point from the perspective of summarizing historical experience in his article "How the Chinese People Defeated the Armed Counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek Backed by American Imperialism." He pointed out that the rapid and tragic downfall of Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, is not accidental. It is the inevitable outcome of the reactionary forces that ignore the will and strength of the people, and it is the inevitable outcome of only seeing their temporary surface strength in terms of military power and not seeing their political isolation. This is the historical judgment that should have been made for Chiang Kai-shek's 22 years of bloody reactionary rule in China and more than 100 years of bloody reactionary rule by imperialists in China. The reason why the Chinese revolutionary war was able to receive active support from the broad masses of the people is because the purpose of the revolutionary war fundamentally corresponds to the interests of the vast majority of the people, and it is the direction of the people's hearts, unbreakable.
II. The rural revolutionary base is the strategic base for persisting in a long-term people's war. 
Establishing rural revolutionary bases is an important component of Mao Zedong's people's war theory.During the Land Revolution War, he repeatedly emphasized the importance of implementing the "armed separatist base of the workers and peasants" and criticized the thinking of bandits. Later, in the article "Strategic Issues of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War," he systematically discussed the idea of establishing a base area. He pointed out: the rural revolutionary base area is the "strategic base for carrying out its strategic tasks, achieving the goal of preserving and developing itself, and eliminating and expelling the enemy" in people's war. Without such a strategic base, the execution of all strategic tasks and the realization of the objectives of the war lost their foundation. In the Liberation War, when our army had already transitioned from strategic defense to strategic offense, Mao Zedong still instructed our troops to advance to the enemy-occupied areas and establish solid revolutionary base areas in the enemy's deep rear. Why is it necessary to establish a base area in people's war?
First of all, fundamentally speaking, this is determined by the long-term and brutal characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The enemies of the Chinese revolution are exceptionally powerful. The enemies of the Chinese revolution not only include powerful imperialism, but also powerful feudal forces. And during a certain period, they also include the reactionary bourgeoisie that collaborates with imperialism and feudal forces to be hostile to the people." They not only hold political, economic, and military power, but also adopt blatant violent means to oppress and exploit the Chinese people, suppress revolutionary parties and masses. And the revolutionary forces are relatively weak, the Chinese people have no political freedom, no economic strength, and it is even more difficult for them to engage in decisive battles with the enemy in the military field. Because the enemy is exceptionally powerful, the strength of the Chinese revolution cannot become a force that can ultimately defeat the enemy without a long period of accumulation and training. And because the enemy carries out exceptionally brutal repression against the Chinese revolution, the revolutionary forces cannot persist in their positions and seize the enemy's positions without long-term tempering to exert their tenacity. The long-term and brutal nature of the Chinese revolution determines that the focus of the revolutionary struggle cannot be placed in cities controlled by heavily armed enemies, but should be in the rural areas where the enemy's strength is relatively weak. "If the revolutionary forces are not willing to compromise with imperialism and its lackeys, and are determined to continue fighting, if the revolutionary forces are to prepare themselves and build up their strength, and avoid decisive battles with powerful enemies when their strength is inadequate, then it is necessary to turn backward rural areas into advanced and solid base areas, to create great revolutionary strongholds in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, to oppose the fierce enemies who attack the rural regions using the cities, and to gradually win all the victories of revolution through long-term fighting."
Secondly, our country's revolutionary war is essentially a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat. To conduct people's war, it is necessary to mobilize and rely on peasants. Only by establishing base areas in rural areas can we lead the peasants to deeply carry out land revolution, enable them to solve their immediate interests through land struggles, and thus recognize the leadership of the Communist Party, trust the revolution, and establish a solid alliance between workers and peasants. In this way, we can fully mobilize the peasants to participate in people's war.While emphasizing that China's proletariat is the leader and fundamental driving force of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong also pointed out that the Chinese proletariat also has its unavoidable weaknesses: it has a smaller population (compared with peasants) and a younger age (compared with the proletariat of capitalist countries), and it is impossible to win the victory of the Chinese revolution solely relying on the strength of the urban proletariat. In order for the Chinese proletariat to fulfill its historical mission, it must rely on its most steadfast ally-the peasant class.When analyzing the driving force of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong pointed out that peasants account for 80% of the total population of the country and are the main force of China's national economy.
More than 90% are poor and middle peasants, with poor tenant farmers accounting for 70%. They are deeply oppressed and exploited by feudalism and imperialism. Especially the poor tenant farmers, who make up 70% of the total number of farmers, do not have enough land or have no land at all. They are the semi-proletariat in rural areas and the largest driving force of the Chinese revolution. They are the natural and most reliable allies of the proletariat and the main force of the Chinese revolutionary forces. As early as March 1927, he discussed the seriousness of the peasant issue in the "Investigation Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan". In 1928, he proposed in "Why Can the Red Political Power Exist in China?" and "The Struggle at Jinggang Mountain" that the Chinese revolution must combine armed struggle with land reform and establish revolutionary base areas in rural areas. In 1930, in "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," he further pointed out that the establishment and development of Red Army guerrilla units and red areas is the most important form and inevitable result of the peasant struggle under the leadership of the semi-colonial and semi-feudalist Chinese proletariat. He criticized the view that the leading role of the proletariat is opposed to the role of the main force of the peasant revolution, and pointed out that in the revolutionary struggle in semi-colonial China, the peasant struggle can only fail without the leadership of the workers, and if the peasant struggle surpasses the strength of the workers, it is not conducive to the revolution itself. Therefore, the armed struggle of the Communist Party of China is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat, which determines that the vast rural areas where the peasants are located should become the starting point and foothold for the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution. The rural encircles the cities, which is the inevitable trend and result of this peasant revolutionary war.
Third, in order to defeat the enemy and avoid decisive battles with strong enemies when the forces are insufficient, it is necessary to consolidate and develop strategic bases, accumulate and strengthen revolutionary forces, so as to gradually turn small victories into big victories and create conditions for ultimately achieving the complete victory of the revolutionary war.
Mao Zedong pointed out: "What is the base of guerrilla warfare? It is the strategic base on which guerrilla warfare relies to carry out its strategic tasks, achieve the goal of preserving and developing itself, and eliminating and expelling the enemy. Without this strategic base, the execution of all strategic tasks and the realization of the goal of the war will lose its foundation. Fighting without a rear is indeed the characteristic of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines because it is detached from the main rear of the country. However, without a base, guerrilla warfare cannot survive and develop for a long time. This base is also the rear of guerrilla warfare." He pointed out that due to the large number of vagrant elements in the Red Army and the existence of a large number of vagrant masses, especially in various provinces in the south, there emerged a political ideology of banditry within the Red Army. This ideology is manifested in: 1) Unwillingness to do hard work to establish bases, establish the political power of the people, and expand political influence, but only wanting to expand political influence through mobile guerrilla methods. 2) Expanding the Red Army not by expanding local Red Guards and local Red Army forces to expand the main Red Army, but by taking the route of "enlisting soldiers and buying horses" and "recruiting and surrendering". Impatience and hoping to run to big cities to eat and drink. All these manifestations of the banditry ideology greatly hinder the Red Army from executing its correct tasks. Therefore, eliminating the banditry ideology is an important goal of the ideological struggle within the Red Army. It should be recognized that the banditry ideology of the past, such as that of Huang Chao and Li Zicheng, is not acceptable in today's environment. Later, he pointed out again: "Although the bases are small, they have great political power, standing in opposition to the huge Kuomintang regime, and bringing great difficulties to the Kuomintang's military attacks, because we have the support of the peasants." Therefore, Mao Zedong pointed out the correct method for solving the strategic bases of the people's guerrilla war, which is to establish rural revolutionary bases.
The rural revolutionary base is a great creation of the Communist Party of China in the revolutionary war.Within a country, surrounded by white political powers, there arise small or several small areas of red political power. Currently, China is the only country in the world that has this situation. This is determined by the special laws of the Chinese revolutionary war and represents a significant development of Marxist people's war ideology. With revolutionary bases, there are the fundamental conditions to preserve and develop oneself, and eliminate the enemy. There is also a certain guarantee of manpower and material resources to support long-term wars. The small and weak Red Army can train and improve its combat capabilities in a relatively stable environment. It can choose favorable battlefields and, with the cooperation of local people, use various forms of struggle to strike and eliminate the enemy.
III. The Structure of the Armed Forces in People's War
Relying on the masses to conduct a people's war requires great efforts to organize and arm the masses and mobilize their enthusiasm to participate in the war as much as possible. Our party, in the era of war centered around armed struggle, has developed a distinctive structure of armed forces in the people's war. It combines regular troops with armed mass organizations and combines main force corps with local force corps. It also combines armed masses with unarmed masses. These three combinations not only solve the problem of coordination between different combat units and between the front and rear, but also address the issues of the development and strengthening of the people's army and the consolidation and construction of revolutionary bases.
First, the combination of regular troops with armed mass organizations.
Regular troops refer to forces incorporated into the formal structure of the people's army in various historical periods. They have a unified command system and wear standardized uniforms. Armed mass organizations mainly refer to guerrilla units, militia, and other armed groups. Guerrilla units and militias are irregular armed organizations that fight against the enemy in occupied areas or areas where the enemy is encountered through dispersed, mobile, and ambush tactics. They are characterized by a small number of personnel, simple organization, lightweight equipment, and flexible mobility. The combination of regular troops and guerrilla units is determined by the fact that the Chinese revolutionary war is largely a guerrilla war and that it is required to fully utilize the power of armed masses in warfare.
Mao Zedong believed that conducting a people's war requires not only a strong army but also the widespread establishment of armed mass organizations. He advocated the combination of regular troops and armed mass organizations and pointed out, "The reason why this army is powerful is also because it is coordinated with the vast mass armed organizations such as people's self-defense forces and militias. Without the cooperation of these armed mass forces, it is impossible to defeat the enemy." This shows that the people's army and armed masses are like two wheels of a cart, and one cannot be missing. The people's army is the backbone of the people's war, and armed mass organizations form the broad foundation of the people's war.
Based on this understanding, the Communist Party of China has always made great efforts to establish and develop the people's army while attaching great importance to the establishment and development of armed mass organizations in organizing and leading revolutionary wars. During the period of the Red Army, Red Guard units were organized in various revolutionary bases. During the Land Revolution War, Mao Zedong emphasized the development and strengthening of armed mass organizations and advocated the militarization of rural areas. He pointed out that the Red Army must provide assistance to the Red Guard and peasant-worker revolutionary strike teams in terms of weapons, while helping the people arm themselves as much as possible without compromising the combat effectiveness of the Red Army. Before the First "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign, based on Mao Zedong's arrangements, Red Guard units, Young Pioneer units, surveillance teams, and Red Army reserve units were widely established in the revolutionary bases. Furthermore, a unified command structure for the people's armed forces was established, as well as combat support organizations such as stretchers, transportation, and communications. After the victory of the First "Encirclement and Suppression" Campaign, in preparation for crushing the enemy's subsequent "encirclement and suppression," Mao Zedong corrected the mistake made by the "Left" leaning leaders at the time of concentrating "all guns into the Red Army" and restored local forces. He also strongly developed armed mass organizations.
A red guerrilla force was established within the white area, and red guard camps (battalions) and independent camps were established in various border counties and districts. Detailed discussions and regulations were made on the tasks, organization, training, and tactics of these armed groups, further improving their military and political qualities and effectively cooperating with the Red Army to defeat several subsequent "encirclement campaigns" by the enemy. Mao Zedong pointed out that the people's guerrilla warfare and the main force of the Red Army complement each other, stating that "without the people's guerrilla warfare, the main force of the Red Army alone is like an one-armed general. Specifically, in terms of combat, it refers to the people who are armed. The enemy fears them, and the main reason is this." During the War of Resistance against Japan, all eligible young and middle-aged people in various anti-Japanese base areas voluntarily joined mass armed organizations under the conditions of voluntary service without leaving their regular jobs. By the later stage of the War of Resistance against Japan, the militia in the liberated areas had developed to 2.2 million, and the people's self-defense forces had developed to nearly 10 million. By the time of the Liberation War, the militia organizations in the liberated areas had developed to 5.5 million. Zhu De once pointed out the tremendous role of mass armed forces in people's war, saying, "The huge militia forces in the liberated areas are unprecedented in our army's history. We have learned to organize militias, which is of great significance. Once militias are organized, they can coordinate with regular troops in combat or fight independently. The great achievements of the people's production movement in the liberated areas are largely due to the defense efforts of the militia, and the recovery of many enemy strongholds in the enemy rear was greatly facilitated by the besieging actions of the militia. At the same time, the militia and self-defense forces also generally undertake production tasks, allowing the integration of combat and production, the combination of military force and labor force. Implementing this kind of task has transformed many old forms in the countryside."
Second, the combination of main force corps and local corps.
According to the needs of the struggle, the people's army is divided into two parts: the main force corps and the local corps. Mao Zedong pointed out that this division is also a factor that gives the people's army strength.
The main force corps has high concentration and strong organizational discipline, as well as good weapons and equipment. It is not restricted by fixed areas and can carry out strategic tasks across regions as needed by the national strategy. With the cooperation of local corps and militias, it can engage in large-scale campaigns, battles, and even strategic decisive battles to destroy enemy heavy forces. The local corps is a force that operates within a certain range domestically. Within a certain area, it works with militias to defend the local area and attack the local enemy. The local corps is an important link between the main force corps and mass armed organizations. It is an important armed force for developing our army, strengthening the people's strength, and implementing people's war. In terms of combat, it can not only assist the main force corps in carrying out important tasks but also play a pillar role in the local people's struggle against the enemy. In terms of connecting with the masses, as the vast majority of officers and soldiers are locals who are familiar with the local geography, customs, and sentiments, they can easily blend in with the local people, facilitating deeper connections with the local population and allowing for more effective mobilization and organization of the masses to participate in and support people's war. In terms of expanding the military, it is more convenient for on-the-spot organization and the recruitment and enlistment of militias and the general population. When necessary, it can be transformed into a main force corps.
The main force corps and the local corps have different focuses in their tasks, but their operational objectives are the same. Only by closely combining the two can the enemy be effectively struck.Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to the construction and integration of the main force and local force. He pointed out, "The strength of this army lies not only in its division into main force and local force, but also in the fact that the former can carry out combat missions beyond the region, while the latter is tasked with coordinating with the militia and self-defense forces to defend the local area and launch attacks on local enemies. This division has won the sincere support of the people. Without this correct division, for example, if only the role of the main force is emphasized while ignoring the role of the local force, it would be impossible to defeat the enemy in the conditions of the liberated areas in China." During the period of the land revolution war, some people only focused on the construction of the main Red Army and neglected the development of local armed forces. Mao Zedong criticized this erroneous thinking. He first affirmed the importance of building the main force of the Red Army and pointed out, "If there are only local militia without a formal Red Army, they can only deal with bandits, not with formal white armies. Therefore, even with a good mass base of workers and peasants, without a considerable force of formal armed troops, it is absolutely impossible to establish a base, let alone a long-term and expanding base." At the same time, Mao Zedong also attached great importance to the construction of local armed forces and clearly stipulated that assisting in the development of local armed forces was a major task of the Red Army. Mao Zedong believed that with both the main Red Army and local armed forces, the two can combine and cooperate with each other to better strike the enemy and achieve victory. When summarizing the experience of the Jinggangshan struggle, he said, "After more than a year, we have created local armed forces with rich combat experience, which is very rare; the combined strength of these local armed forces and the Fourth Army of the Red Army cannot be destroyed by any enemy." During the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zedong further elaborated on this viewpoint, demanding that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, upon arrival in each area, immediately assist the local people in organizing local forces and local units under the leadership of local cadres. This can then generate main forces and main units led by local people. In terms of the construction of local forces, in order to adapt to the needs of the struggle against the enemy, he also demanded the organization of well-trained armed work teams that are comparatively sound in military, political, and mass work, deep into the enemy-occupied areas to fight against the enemy, and mobilize the masses in the anti-Japanese struggle, in order to effectively coordinate with the front-line combat of the various anti-Japanese base areas. In order to strengthen the local armed forces, during the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army also adopted the approach of localizing the main force in some areas. During the most difficult period of the war, following the guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army downsized their main forces and transferred no less than one-third of the main forces to various military sub-regions, independent regiments, guerrilla brigades, etc. as the backbone, in order to enhance the military and political qualities of the local forces and consolidate the construction of the base areas. In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, a part of the local forces gathered under certain conditions and transformed into the main force, undertaking large-scale regular combat tasks. During the Liberation War, by promptly upgrading local forces, the People's Liberation Army's main force rapidly expanded to millions in number, creating important conditions for quickly achieving victory in the war.
Thirdly, the combination of armed and unarmed masses.
To unleash the power of people's war, it is necessary to arm the masses and create conditions for the direct participation of the people in the war. However, armed masses alone are not sufficient, because armed masses cannot possibly represent the entire or the majority of the people. The majority of the people are unarmed, and it is equally important to indirectly organize their strength into the war. Only by combining armed and unarmed masses can a truly people's war with the participation of the entire nation be realized. Therefore, the combination of armed and unarmed masses refers to the overall combination of people's war.
It is the key link to establish mass armed organizations and non-armed mass organizations, so that all the people can participate in organizations related to the people's war. In other words, on the one hand, we need to establish mass armed forces such as militias and self-defense forces, while also actively establishing mass organizations such as trade unions, agricultural associations, student associations, women's associations, and children's groups, to unite all non-armed people's organizations so that they can also play a role in the victory of the people's war under the leadership of the party and the revolutionary government.
The combination of armed and non-armed masses is largely manifested through the combination of armed struggle and non-armed struggle. The armed masses have certain military qualities, possess weapons, and are able to fully utilize the power of weapons, thus they are the basic force in conducting the people's war. The role of non-armed masses in supporting the frontline and supporting long-term revolutionary wars should not be overlooked. They are an indispensable and important force in the revolutionary war. Firstly, the non-armed masses can "enthusiastically engage in various tasks to support the army," which we commonly refer to as supporting the front-line work. This includes both supporting regular armies, such as mobilizing the people to join the army, transporting food for the army, providing preferential treatment to military families, and helping the army solve material difficulties, as well as supporting militias and guerrillas. For example, mobilizing the people to participate in militias and guerrillas, assisting them in conducting ambushes, reconnoitering enemy situations, eliminating spies, standing guard, and transporting and protecting the wounded. These are all tasks that directly help the army in combat. In the three major battles of the liberation war, the masses responded to the call of "fully supporting the front-line, everything for victory." Millions of people were mobilized across the country, achieving a ratio of one civilian for every soldier, or even one civilian for two soldiers, or three. This kind of real people's war is rare in the history of world wars. Secondly, the non-armed masses can also "enthusiastically engage in political, economic, cultural, and health construction work," which refers to the various works of building the base areas. Without the political construction, economic construction, and cultural, educational, and health construction of the masses in the base areas, there would be no foundation for conducting the people's war.
In the people's war, on the one hand, the army takes military actions to assist the people in various struggles, and on the other hand, the people engage in various struggles (political, economic, cultural, transportation, military) to coordinate with the army's combat. Without this coordination, the revolutionary war cannot achieve victory. It should also be emphasized here that mobilizing the masses to participate in the war is not just an organizational and military issue, but also requires corresponding political and economic policies to ensure that the people can have a say in politics and obtain practical benefits in the economy. Zhu De pointed out in "On the Liberation Area Battlefield": "Military affairs are related to politics and economy. The basic content of the people's war is a mass war. Only when all the above-mentioned political and economic things are in place can this kind of mass war be possible."
In conclusion, the armed forces system of people's war is an important part of the ideology of people's war. It not only provides a reliable foundation for replenishing and ensuring the quality of personnel in the people's army but also enables the main force units to receive effective support from various forms of armed forces in battle, forming a net of heaven and earth for people's war. The reason why our army has strength lies in the three-way combination of armed forces, which is a very important factor.
Section 5: Strategies and Tactics of People's War
I. The Strategic Concept of Active Defense
The strategy and tactics of People's War by the Communist Party of China were developed throughout the practice of revolutionary warfare in China. During the long period of revolutionary warfare in China, the situation was often one where the enemy was strong and we were weak. The opposing forces faced by our army, whether it be the reactionary Kuomintang, Japanese imperialism, or American imperialism, had far superior military and economic power compared to our army. However, politically, our army held an absolute advantage. With the leadership of the Communist Party, our army conducted a just and progressive revolution, while the enemies carried out unjust and reactionary warfare. Our army enjoyed extensive support from the people and had high morale. The fundamental starting point of the party's strategic and tactical thinking was based on the realities of both sides, fully utilizing subjectivity within the established objective material conditions, aiming to guide the war to our advantage based on inferior equipment against the enemy with superior equipment. Based on this fundamental concept, a series of military strategies and tactics were formed.
Recognizing active defense and rejecting passive defense, the party implemented a strategy of holding on to the internal lines in sustained defensive warfare strategically, and carried out decisive offensive operations on the external lines in battles and campaigns. This is the policy of active defense proposed by the party based on the practice of revolutionary warfare in China.
What is active defense and what is passive defense? This is the question that needs to be clarified and resolved first when implementing strategic defense. Mao Zedong pointed out, "Active defense, also known as offensive defense or decisive defense. Passive defense, also known as static defense or pure defense. Passive defense is actually false defense, only active defense is true defense, which is defense for the purpose of counterattacks and offensives." He believed that active defense, in terms of operational guidance, is the application of both defense and offense. Through defense, forces are conserved and prepared to break through the enemy's defenses. It is a means to support offensive actions or to transition into an offensive. On the other hand, passive defense is not aimed at counterattacks and offensives. In terms of combat tactics, it only adopts a pure defensive approach without taking offensive measures.
The strategic concept of active defense is specifically manifested as follows: conducting sustained defensive warfare by holding on to the internal lines strategically, and carrying out decisive offensive warfare on the external lines in battles and campaigns. The terms "internal lines" and "external lines" refer to the scope of the front lines, "sustained" and "decisive" refer to the duration of the military operations, and "defense" and "offense" refer to the forms of warfare. Strategically, as determined by the situation of the enemy being strong and we being weak, our army was forced to adopt a strategy of internal lines and sustained defensive warfare, which placed us in a passive and unfavorable position. Mao Zedong believed that in order to seize the initiative in the war and annihilate the enemy's active forces, our army must, in battles and campaigns and on a local scale, reverse the situation and carry out decisive offensive operations on the external lines. Only through offensive actions can we mass destroy the enemy and gradually change the balance of power. The decisiveness enables our army to avoid reinforcement from the enemy and being surrounded, while the external lines allow us to encircle the enemy from all sides, achieving the goal of complete annihilation. In summary, only by conducting decisive offensive operations on the external lines in battles and campaigns can our army shift from a strategically passive state to an active one in actual combat, gradually annihilating the enemy while safeguarding ourselves and shattering the repeated "counter-revolutionary encirclement" by the enemy.How can our army transition from a strategy of sustained internal defensive warfare to decisive offensive warfare on the external lines? The key lies in adopting the "luring the enemy in deep" policy. This is a planned and necessary step taken in the situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak in order to conserve our forces and prepare for breaking through the enemy's defenses.The necessity and benefits of doing so are as follows: First, "luring the enemy deep" can allow our army to avoid unfavorable decisive battles with the enemy and wait for favorable conditions before engaging in battle. Second, "luring the enemy deep" allows our army to contract and concentrate forces, transforming the strategic imbalance of strength into a tactical advantage where we are stronger and the enemy is weaker, making it possible to swiftly attack from the outside in battle. Third, "luring the enemy deep" causes the enemy to penetrate our territory, like a blind person riding a blind horse, making it difficult for them to move even an inch. Consequently, the fatigued ones will be weakened, and the weakened ones will be eliminated. This greatly reduces their advantage while our army can operate freely and effectively within our territory, transforming our strategic passivity into tactical initiative, seeking favorable opportunities for decisive attacks against the enemy. The aforementioned strategy of active defense is accumulated from the practical experience of the Chinese revolution. During the period of the Land Revolution War, the small Red Army was always faced with the enemy's offensive. The most crucial task at that time was how to break through the enemy's "encirclement and suppression". Therefore, the main task of active defense was to preserve our forces, wait for the right moment to defeat the enemy, and destroy each of the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" attempts in order to secure the survival of the Red Army and achieve victory and growth. The basic principles of guerrilla warfare, namely the "16-character formula" - "lure the enemy to advance, harass the enemy when they halt, exhaust the enemy and then attack, pursue the enemy when they retreat" - comprise the initial form of active defense strategy. By early November 1930, before the first counter-"encirclement and suppression" operation in the Central Soviet Area, the guideline of "luring the enemy deep" was explicitly proposed. During the Long March, after the convergence of the First and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army in 1935, the strategic guideline of "concentrating the main forces to launch a northern offensive, annihilating the enemy on a large scale through mobile warfare, and securing the southern part of Gansu Province to create a base area in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and the Soviet regions" was established. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zedong profoundly explained the characteristics of the era in which the Sino-Japanese War took place, analyzed the fundamental factors of mutual contradiction between the enemy and us and their evolving trends in the war, and revealed that the Anti-Japanese War was a protracted war, and victory would ultimately belong to China as an objective law. It was anticipated that the Anti-Japanese War would go through three stages: strategic defense, strategic stalemate, and strategic counterattack. The general strategic guideline for the Anti-Japanese War was a protracted war, with specific strategic guidelines as follows: in the first and second stages, adopt a strategic posture of enduring defense internally and swift attack externally in campaign and battle; in the third stage, conduct strategic counterattacks. It was also noted that our army was caught in a war of various forms, with interwoven encirclements and multiple enemy attacks. The primary task of active defense was to systematically break through the encirclement and "sweep" the enemy, continuously strengthening our military power and promoting the expansion and development of base areas, thereby accumulating strength for strategic counterattacks. The Eighth Route Army should implement independent and autonomous mountain guerrilla warfare; the basic form is guerrilla warfare, but the opportunity for mobile warfare should not be neglected. At the same time, it was pointed out that the shift in the overall strategic guideline would inevitably be towards mobile warfare. In the early stage of the Liberation War, under the conditions of our weakness and the enemy's strategic offensive against our strategic defense, the main task of active defense was to avoid the enemy's sharp attacks, engage in mobile operations, and aim to eliminate the enemy’s main forces. Mao Zedong pointed out that we are capable of defeating Chiang Kai-shek, and the entire party should have full confidence in this. The general method of defeating Chiang Kai-shek is generally mobile warfare. Therefore, the temporary abandonment of several places and cities is not only unavoidable but also necessary. The temporary abandonment of several places and cities is done to annihilate the enemy's main forces in large numbers, change the situation between the enemy and us, and achieve final victory.
He explicitly put forward the strategic policy of "taking the annihilation of the enemy's combat forces as the primary goal, not the occupation or seizure of territory", and proposed the operational principles and methods of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy". After the People's Liberation Army gradually gained strategic initiative and achieved a relative balance of strategic power with the enemy, he proposed to timely guide strategic defense towards strategic counterattacks and strategic offensives, and put forward the famous "Ten Great Military Principles" with annihilating battles as the core. When the conditions for a strategic decisive battle were mature, Mao Zedong correctly chose the timing of the decisive battle, determined the direction of the battle, formulated the operational principles of the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns, combining large-scale mobile warfare with large-scale positional warfare, and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. In the strategic pursuit, he also proposed the principle of implementing large encirclements and large detours, which fully applied and developed the overall guideline of active defense. In short, the specific strategic policies and operational principles proposed by Mao Zedong in each revolutionary war are the concrete implementation and embodiment of the overall guideline of active defense in different periods or stages of the warfare. Therefore, there is no fixed model for implementing the overall guideline of active defense, it evolves with the changing circumstances of the war.
II. Creative Application and Development of Operational Forms
"The essence of war is its purpose, which is to preserve oneself and annihilate the enemy. However, there are three forms of war that can achieve this purpose: mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare." To adapt to the changing development of the war situation, based on changes in the relative strengths of the enemy and us and the evolution of the war situation, a military strategic transformation with transforming the main operational form as the core content must be timely carried out while adhering to the overall goal of self-preservation and enemy annihilation. Determining a strategic policy that conforms to objective reality, choosing appropriate operational methods, flexibly applying various operational forms, and closely integrating and complementing each other are important manifestations of Mao Zedong's superb art of war command.
Mobile warfare and positional warfare are both regular warfare forms, while guerrilla warfare belongs to irregular warfare. Mobile warfare refers to the offensive form of decisive operations conducted by regular corps along long fronts and in large theaters; positional warfare refers to defensive operations conducted on fortified positions or field positions, as well as offensive operations to defend against enemies on fortified positions or field positions; guerrilla warfare is a dispersed and mobile form of warfare and is also a form of mass armed struggle. The three forms have different characteristics and roles. The characteristic of mobile warfare is the concentration of regular corps, campaigns, and battles, with offensive and fluidity, and it plays a major role in annihilating enemy combat forces, changing the situation of the war, and ultimately determining the fate of the war. The characteristic of positional warfare is sufficient preparation time, sound organization, and long duration of combat, and it plays an important role in repelling enemy attacks and capturing enemy fortified areas. The characteristics of guerrilla warfare are greater initiative, flexibility, offensive nature, decisiveness, and mobility compared to mobile warfare, and it plays a crucial role in supporting regular operations and the survival and development of weak forces.
In the practice of leading the Chinese revolutionary war, the Party conducted in-depth research on the issues of guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare, as well as their close combination, developed theories on the issue of operational forms, and creatively and flexibly applied these three forms of warfare. In the long-term practice of the revolutionary war in China for more than 20 years, the People's Army flexibly used different forms of warfare according to historical conditions and different war situations in different historical periods.
During the first three years of the Land Revolution War and the entire period of the Anti-Japanese War, guerrilla warfare was the main form of combat. In the years following the Land Revolution War and throughout the Liberation War, mobile warfare became the main form of combat. As the war progressed, positional warfare became an important form of combat in the later stages of the Liberation War and the later stages of the Korean War. According to the development and changes in the war situation, the main form of combat should be switched in a timely manner, and the three forms of combat should be closely integrated, complementing each other and flexibly applied, in order to achieve the most effective power in the practice of the people's war. As early as 1938, Mao Zedong pointed out: "Some people say that we only advocate guerrilla warfare, which is nonsense. We have always advocated the combination of mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare." "Based on the experience of the past seven months of combat, if we can use the three methods of mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare in military operations, we can make the enemy extremely difficult." During the period when guerrilla warfare was the main form of combat for the People's Army, regular warfare was not rejected in all situations. The guideline Mao Zedong formulated for the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War was "the basic form is guerrilla warfare, but we do not neglect mobile warfare under favorable conditions." In battlefield operations, there is mobile warfare within positional warfare, and positional warfare within mobile warfare. The transformation from mobile warfare to positional warfare, or from positional warfare to mobile warfare, is a situation that is often encountered. In the Chinese Revolutionary War, our army flexibly used various forms of combat and combined them organically, thereby creating miracles in the history of human warfare.
III. The Formation of Combat Methods with Chinese Revolutionary Characteristics
The main method of our army's combat is to annihilate the enemy's active forces as the main goal and concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy. This method of warfare has the effects of complete annihilation and speedy decision. Therefore, it is also the basic principle among the various principles of our army's combat. Concentrating superior forces and annihilating the enemy are dialectically unified. Only by concentrating superior forces can we achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy, and only by annihilating the enemy can we better form and maintain the superiority of forces.
The Chinese Revolutionary War was fought under the conditions of a strong enemy and a weak our side and for a long period of time, our side was in a defensive position in terms of strategy. Therefore, the issue of concentrating superior forces became more difficult and more important. To this end, starting from the struggle in Jinggangshan, Mao Zedong consistently emphasized the concentrated use of forces and made profound and comprehensive discussions. In 1928, he proposed, "Our experience shows that almost every time we divided forces, we failed. Concentrating forces to attack enemies who are smaller, equal, or slightly larger than us often leads to victory." In 1936, when he summarized the experience of our army's ten-year Land Revolution War, he made a special discussion on the issue of concentrating forces, explicitly pointing out, "In order to win in strategic defense, we basically relied on the move of concentrating forces." Mao Zedong mainly referred to the fact that our army, which was in a weak position strategically, could only change the balance of power between the enemy and us on a local level and turn from defense in strategy to offense in campaigns and battles by concentrating superior forces in battles and campaigns. At the same time, it also changed from being in an inner line strategically to being in an outer line in campaigns and battles, thus gaining local advantages and initiative, and then gradually annihilating enemies one by one. After winning many victories, the overall situation also turned into an advantage and initiative. That is, "winning with few against many, winning with disadvantage against advantage". It is all based on one's own local advantages and initiative, defeating the enemy's local disadvantage and passivity in one battle, and then attacking the rest one by one, so that the overall situation turns into an advantage and initiative. During the Liberation War, Mao Zedong further expounded on the idea of concentrating superior forces. He drafted the combat instructions "Concentrate Superior Forces, Annihilate the Enemy" on behalf of the Central Military Commission, stating that "this is the main method of defeating Jiang Jieshi's offensive."
"Implementing this method will lead to victory. Going against this method will result in failure." In his famous "Ten Military Principles," he further emphasized, "In every battle, concentrate absolute superiority in numbers (twice, three times, four times, sometimes even five or six times the enemy's forces), surround the enemy from all sides, strive for total annihilation, and do not let any escape." He pointed out the significance of annihilating enemy combat forces as the primary goal of our military operations, rather than focusing on defending or capturing cities and territories. Because only by annihilating the enemy's combat forces can we ultimately defend and capture cities and territories. In a situation where the enemy is stronger and we are weaker, only through such means can we avoid engaging in unfavorable decisive battles with the enemy and instead engage in advantageous decisive battles. "The temporary abandonment of certain places and cities is not only unavoidable but necessary. Temporarily giving up certain places and cities is for the sake of achieving final victory; otherwise, we cannot achieve final victory." Mao Zedong pointed out, "When it comes to people, it is better to break one finger than to injure ten fingers; when it comes to the enemy, it is better to annihilate one division than to decimate ten divisions." This is because the systematic annihilation of the enemy makes it difficult for them to replenish their forces, and by annihilating one unit, we reduce their overall strength. Additionally, such an annihilation battle inflicts a significant blow to the enemy psychologically, discourages their morale, and shakes their military determination. Furthermore, it greatly boosts the morale of our military and people and allows us to replenish our forces in terms of manpower, equipment, and supplies. Decisive battles and attrition warfare are unable to achieve the aforementioned objectives. However, this does not negate the significance of decisive battles and attrition warfare under certain conditions. Mao Zedong pointed out, "Generally speaking, mobile warfare is executed to fulfill the mission of annihilation, positional warfare is executed to fulfill the mission of attrition, and guerrilla warfare is executed to fulfill both the mission of attrition and the mission of annihilation."
How to concentrate forces? How much force should be concentrated to gain advantage over the enemy? Based on our military's combat experience, it mainly manifests in the following aspects: First, concentrate the main forces on the primary combat direction and save forces as much as possible in secondary directions, opposing military egalitarianism. The people's army has long been in a surrounded environment and faces a formidable and numerous enemy. It must concentrate the main forces on the primary combat direction and must not engage in attacks or divide forces. Mao Zedong said, "Under the conditions of a strong enemy presence, no matter how many troops we have, at any given time, there should only be one main direction of use, not two." Concentrating superior forces means concentrating them at the decisive moment on the main combat direction. On the secondary direction, only a portion of the forces should be used to contain the enemy. Only by doing so can we form a fist, create an advantage, and ensure victory. Liu Bocheng pointed out, "In every offensive battle, we must choose the main assault direction, assemble the main forces, and strive for victory in decisive battles. But at the same time, for the secondary direction, we must use another force to contain the enemy, attracting their attention and reinforcements, thereby ensuring the success of our main assault. In other words, we can have one person engage in a tough fight against three enemies in the secondary direction, allowing us to have three people powerfully strike one enemy in the main direction, seeking overall victory. Based on the experience and lessons learned from the people's army's years of combat, the Party emphasized the principle of concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy from strategic deployment to tactical deployment during the Liberation War and opposed military egalitarianism. Mao Zedong pointed out: In terms of strategic deployment, when the enemy uses many regiments (or battalions) to advance towards our army from multiple directions, our army must concentrate absolute superiority in numbers at the appropriate time, first surround and annihilate one regiment (or battalion) of the enemy, and use a small number of forces to contain the rest of the enemy's regiments (or battalions), preventing them from quickly reinforcing the regiment (or battalion) that is being surrounded by our army, in order to facilitate our army's first annihilation of that regiment (or battalion). After accomplishing that, depending on the situation, we may annihilate one or more regiments of the enemy or withdraw our forces to recuperate and prepare for the next battle. We must never underestimate the enemy and therefore divide forces equally to deal with multiple enemy routes, resulting in the inability to annihilate even one route, thus putting ourselves in a passive position.Similarly, in terms of tactical deployment, when our army has concentrated overwhelming forces to surround one of the routes (a brigade or a regiment) of the enemy, the attacking corps (or troops) should not attempt to annihilate all the surrounded enemies at once. Therefore, dividing forces everywhere, attacking without effectiveness, delaying time, and difficult to achieve results. Instead, they should concentrate superior forces, select a weaker point (not two points) from the enemy positions, and launch a fierce attack, aiming to achieve victory. After succeeding, expand the fruits of victory rapidly and annihilate the enemy.
Secondly, start by attacking weaker enemies, and appropriately determine the extent of concentration of forces based on the target of annihilation. Mao Zedong discussed the concentration of forces and the deployment to annihilate the enemy, requiring that in a campaign, the first target for attack should be "the weaker brigades of the enemy, or those with fewer reinforcements, or the position and local sentiment that are more advantageous to us and disadvantageous to the enemy." In terms of tactics, "select a weaker point (not two points) from the enemy positions." In this way, the People's Army confronts weaker enemies with more troops, thereby strengthening their advantage. "First attack the weak" can easily form an advantage, and after winning against the weak enemy, the stronger enemy becomes weaker.
In the Chinese revolutionary war, the party always emphasized the implementation of the tactics of "first attack the weak" and the degree of concentration of forces are closely related. The basic requirement for concentrating superior forces is to "surround the enemy from all sides, strive for complete annihilation, and not let any escape." If this requirement is met, it can be considered as forming an advantage. Mao Zedong said, "We advocate the concentration of forces based on the principle of ensuring absolute or relative superiority in battlefields. For strong enemies or battles of vital importance, we should have an absolute advantage in forces." "Relative superiority in forces will suffice for weak enemies or battles of minor importance." This points out that the degree of concentration of forces should be based on a confident assurance of annihilating the enemy. In this regard, not only must we consider troops, but also firepower; not only quantity but also quality; it requires considering material factors as well as psychological factors. In addition, there are conditions such as time and location. Only through overall consideration can we avoid exaggerating the advantage of one aspect into a comprehensive advantage, resulting in the failure to achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy. For example, when attacking a strong enemy, a higher degree of concentration of forces is required, while a lower degree can be sufficient when attacking a weaker enemy. If our attacking forces have weaker combat capability, a higher degree of concentration is needed, and vice versa. During strategic offenses and pursuits, when the people and geographical conditions are favorable to us, a lower degree of concentration of forces is acceptable. During periods of strategic defense or counterattacks, or in areas where the people and terrain are unfavorable, a higher degree is required. Confronting a familiar enemy, it is easier to achieve an appropriate degree of concentration of forces, but when facing an unfamiliar enemy, room for flexibility should be left. In summary, the principles of concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy should be flexibly applied, tailoring the deployment to the specific circumstances, and avoiding dogmatism.
Thirdly, adopt the strategy of encirclement and siege. The purpose of concentrating forces is to fight annihilating battles, therefore, Mao Zedong pointed out that, "Annihilating battles, concentrating superior forces, and adopting encirclement and flank attack tactics have the same meaning. Without the latter, there is no former." It is difficult to achieve an annihilating battle without superior forces; without encirclement and flank attacks, even with absolute superiority in forces, an annihilating battle cannot be achieved. The principle of encirclement and flank attack is the deployment principle for annihilation, which can trap the enemy in complete isolation and prevent their escape. Of course, depending on the actual situation of the operation, occasionally adopting three-side encirclement or two-side attacks is also allowed. In terms of tactical means, it is required to take actions such as detouring, infiltrating, dividing, and penetrating, in order to divide and annihilate the enemy.
The application of concentrating superior forces and annihilating the enemy involves many aspects, such as actively creating and capturing opportunities, meticulous organizational preparation, flexible use of offensive styles, and the tenacious fighting spirit of the army, all of which play an important role in the application of this principle and must not be overlooked.
IV. The strategic offensive thought
The strategic offensive is one of the basic styles of war operations, and it is a comprehensive offensive against the enemy of strategic defense. The basic task of strategic offensive is to annihilate the enemy forces in large numbers, occupy strategic territories in enemy territory, and seize victory in the war. The strategic decisive battle is the climax of the strategic offensive and the basic means to fundamentally transform the war power. It is the main force of both the enemy and us that determines the outcome of the war. The strategic offensive of the Chinese revolution war evolved from strategic defense. It is usually linked to strategic counterattacks. In the early stage of the land revolution war and the later stage of the liberation war, our army experienced two strategic offensives of different scales and forms. One is the strategic offensive implemented by the Red Army in the period of the land revolution war. Under the situation of a weak enemy and a weak us, after breaking the enemy's "encirclement and suppression", the Red Army implemented a strategic offensive in the border areas, mainly to open up and expand revolutionary base areas. This strategic offensive is smaller in scale, limited in purpose, regional, and repetitive. The other is the national-scale strategic offensive carried out during the liberation war. It was carried out under the fundamental change in the situation of the war. Its purpose is to annihilate the enemy's heavy forces, overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and liberate all of China. When our army switched to strategic offensive, Mao Zedong once said: The revolutionary war of the Chinese people has now reached a turning point. This is the Chinese People's Liberation Army's repelling of the millions of reactionary troops attacking by the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and has turned itself into an offensive. This is a turning point in history, and it is a turning point from the development to the elimination of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years.
From the perspective of the entire ideological system, the strategic offensive thought includes three parts: strategic offensive, strategic decisive battle, and strategic pursuit. Regarding strategic offensive, according to the general laws of war, it is usually implemented when the attacking side turns into a disadvantage and the defending side turns into an advantage, or when the defending side completely crushes the attacker and the attacker turns to strategic defense. The strategic offensive of our army during the liberation war broke the usual pattern that people usually see and think about. The timing of this strategic offensive is not when the balance of power between us and the enemy is generally balanced, or when it exceeds the enemy, or when the enemy's attack is completely crushed and turns to strategic defense, but when the enemy still has a large advantage in numbers and is still focusing on the offensive, a part of our forces continue to defend, and the main force turns to offense. The main direction of the strategic offensive is not directly aimed at the main force group that the enemy carries out the main offensive, but at the strategic depth with weak enemy forces and the central area of ​​the enemy's ruling forces. It does not adopt the usual front-line offensive, but implements a long-range leapfrog attack, directly penetrating the enemy's strategic depth.
In the first year of the liberation war, our army implemented internal line operations, won great victories by annihilating a large number of enemy regular forces, and gained the initiative on several battlefields, making the war situation clearly develop in a direction favorable to the people. Of course, in this process, our army also paid the price of casualties and the occupation of large areas of land. At that time, the Kuomintang controlled most of the country's area and population, and had the full support of American imperialism. In this situation, it was extremely difficult to rely solely on the manpower and material resources of the liberated areas to transform the enemy's superior and inferior situation through internal line annihilation.
And what the Kuomintang has adopted is precisely to continue the war in the liberated areas, further destroying and depleting the human and material resources of the liberated areas, so that I cannot sustain the counter-revolutionary strategic policy. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after assessing the situation, determined that the basic task for the second year of the campaign, based on the victory of the first year, was to "launch a nationwide counterattack, that is, to use the main force to attack the enemy's rear and bring the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and annihilate a large number of enemies on the rear lines." To this end, the Central Military Commission developed the plan of "launching a massive attack and strategizing the Central Plains," instructing the 120,000 troops led by Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army to launch the first attack on the enemy in the Ji-Lu-Yu and Yu-Wan-Su regions, and the second attack into the Central Plains. In accordance with this overall plan, on the night of June 30, 1947, Liu and Deng's troops successfully crossed the Yellow River, marking the beginning of the strategic offensive. At the same time, the Central Military Commission also made meticulous arrangements for "coordination among the three armies and the containment of the flanks," which meant that in addition to the Liu and Deng army breaking through the center and directly attacking Dabie Mountain, the Hua-Dong Field Army led by Chen Yi and Su Yu would serve as the left rear army, advancing into the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan area, and the Tai-Yue Army led by Chen Mi and others would serve as the right rear army, advancing into western Henan. The three armies vied for control of the Central Plains through maneuvering and annihilating the enemy between the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and Han River. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army in northern Shaanxi launched an attack on Yulin, diverting the main force of the enemy's Hu Zongnan group to move northwards, while the People's Liberation Army in Shandong launched an offensive in Jiaodong, continuing to lure the enemy towards the coast to facilitate the actions of the three armies. In early August 1947, Liu and Deng's army crossed the Longhai Line, and by the end of the month, they reached Dabie Mountain, Chen and Su's army advanced into southwest Shandong in early August, and Chen Zhan's unit crossed the Yellow River and entered western Henan in late August. By the end of October, the three armies had basically completed the strategic deployment in the Central Plains region, pushing the main battlefield in the southern front towards the enemy-occupied areas, coordinating with various battlefields across the country, and reversing the overall war situation. As for the strategic decisive battle, it is a military operation in which the two opposing sides use their main forces to determine the outcome of the war. "Only through a decisive battle can the question of who wins and who loses between the two armies be resolved." The strategic decisive battle is the climax of strategic offensive, "it is the most intense, complex, ever-changing, difficult, and arduous stage in a total war or campaign, and in terms of command, it is the most difficult season." The strategic decisive battle of the Chinese revolution began after our army transitioned into strategic offensive. After one year of transitioning into strategic offensive, from September 1948 to January 1949, within a time span of 4 months and 19 days, we successfully conducted strategic decisive battles against the enemy in the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin Campaigns. In total, we annihilated 144 regular enemy divisions (brigades) and 29 irregular divisions (equivalent to brigades), totaling 1.54 million troops. The victory in the three major battles eliminated the foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. In the strategic decisive battles, our army accurately grasped the timing. Mao Zedong said, "Without the timing for a decisive battle and without the power for a decisive battle, one cannot recklessly engage in a decisive battle. Otherwise, victory will certainly not be achieved. On the other hand, if one is too late, the enemy may carry out a strategic retreat, and the decisive battle may also fail to materialize." In March 1948, Mao Zedong analyzed in his "Report on the Situation" that among the 250 enemy divisions in the north and south, only 180 divisions had not suffered a decisive blow from our army. And among these divisions, some were newly trained recruits in the second line, and some were upgraded or newly formed from local forces and puppet troops, with very weak combat effectiveness. The average number of enemy troops per division also decreased from around 8,000 to around 6,500. From this, it can be seen that the quantity and quality of the enemy troops were both sharply declining. Politically, the Chiang regime was already very isolated, and its economy was on the verge of collapse. Our army, on the other hand, has further developed and improved both in terms of quantity and quality, with better weapons and equipment, and more combat experience.
In the Northeast region, the Nationalist army consisted of 550,000 personnel, trapped in the three regions of Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. Our army, on the other hand, had 700,000 personnel, not only outnumbering the enemy but also being in an extremely advantageous position. It can be said that we had both numerical and positional advantages. The highest command of the Kuomintang army was still undecided on whether to withdraw or defend against the enemy forces in the Northeast. All of these circumstances indicate that the time is ripe to launch a strategic decisive battle from the Northeastern theater. If we don't act now, the enemy will make up their mind to withdraw their forces from the Northeast to the interior or the south, which will greatly increase the difficulties in future operations. The victory in the Liaoshen Campaign wiped out an enemy force of 470,000, shifting the numerical advantage to the People's Liberation Army and liberating the entire Northeast region. This laid the foundation for liberating Pingjin, Tianjin, and North China, and provided a strategically secure rear area with a certain industrial base for the Liberation War. From then on, the overall military situation of the country changed dramatically, followed by the great victories in the Huaihai and Pingjin Campaigns, greatly shortening the original plan to defeat Chiang Kai-shek in five years.
In the strategic decisive battle, our army formulated different campaign guiding principles based on different decisive battle targets. The operational guiding principle in the Liaoshen Campaign was to encircle the enemy, block the Nationalist army in the Northeast, and annihilate them one by one. At the beginning of the campaign, Mao Zedong instructed that the key for the main force of the Northeast Field Army was to control the Beining Line, and the first target was to capture Jinzhou. Jinzhou is a strategic location connecting the Northeast and North China, it is the gateway to the interior. "Once Jinzhou is captured, you will have the initiative, it will be a great victory." Therefore, the main attack direction of the Liaoshen Campaign directly aimed at the Beining Line, and the first priority was to concentrate forces to capture Jinzhou. Once this strategic intention was achieved, it completely closed off the land route for the enemy in the Northeast to retreat to the interior, creating a situation of "closing the door and hitting the dog." In the Huaihai Campaign, the Central Committee of the Party, based on the isolated and prominent situation of the enemy's Huang Baitao Corps and the ease of annihilation, timely instructed to seize Suxian County, cut off the strategic connection between the enemy's Xuzhou Corps and Bengbu and Nanjing. This not only quickly surrounded and annihilated the enemy's 7th Corps but also divided the enemy forces in Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Mengcheng, putting the defending enemy in Xuzhou in a situation of being surrounded on all sides. This created extremely favorable conditions for our army to annihilate the enemy in the future. In the Pingjin Campaign, the Central Committee of the Party emphasized that in the east, "first, surround and capture Tianjin, Tanggu, Lutai, and Tangshan", and in the west, "as long as Tanggu (the most important) and Xinbao'an are captured, the overall situation will be under control." This effectively cut off the escape routes of tens of thousands of enemy troops in the Pingjin area. Based on the different stages of the campaign's development, the Central Committee of the Party adopted the guiding principles of "separating but not encircling," "encircling but not attacking," "eating away from both ends," and "isolating the middle," causing the enemy to be trapped in a situation where they couldn't regroup, escape, or resist.
As for strategic pursuit, the strategic decisive battle mainly determines the fate of the war. However, to achieve complete victory in the war, the strategic guidance should timely advance the offensive in the enemy's strategic depth, implement strategic pursuit at the right time, and decisively and completely annihilate the enemy to obtain a thorough victory in the war. The strategic pursuit in the Liberation War needs to focus on solving two problems: first, how to expose the enemy's conspiracy of using hypocritical peace talks to obstruct the revolution's progress and inspire the whole party, the whole army, and the entire people to carry the revolutionary war to the end; second, what kind of operational guiding principles to adopt, how to cross the Yangtze River, and how to completely annihilate the residual military forces of the Kuomintang within the mainland of our country, preventing them from stubborn resistance or escape, which would leave future troubles. The former belongs to the political aspect, and the latter belongs to the military aspect, but they are closely linked. If the former problem is not well resolved, it will be unfavorable to military victory, and if the latter problem is not well resolved, it will be difficult to end the war decisively. The Central Committee and the Military Commission, led by Mao Zedong, wisely resolved these two issues.
The Central Committee of the Party issued a great call to "carry the revolution through to the end" to the entire party and army in a timely manner after the three major battles of Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin. With the revolutionary means, they crushed the enemy's counterrevolutionary forces and timely issued the order to "advance to the whole country", calling on the entire army to advance bravely and annihilate all reactionary forces that dared to resist and liberate the whole of China.
Under the command of the Central Committee, the people's army promptly exposed the enemy's false "peace talks" conspiracy, launched an offensive in the enemy's strategic depth, and implemented the Battle of Crossing the Yangtze River, liberating major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuhan, as well as large areas in the Jiangnan region, thereby completely destroying the enemy's reactionary regime. After the victory of the Battle of Crossing the Yangtze River, Mao Zedong inspired the whole army to "use the remaining courage to pursue the defeated enemy, and not to seek fame as a king of learning". Subsequently, our troops launched unprecedented strategic pursuits in the southeast, southwest, southwest, and northwest regions. In order to catch fleeing enemies, Mao Zedong promptly instructed: "Take a big detour, penetrate the enemy's rear, complete the encirclement first, and then launch the attack." Our army, in accordance with this strategy, actively and bravely annihilated the enemy in the pursuits in the southwest and southeast, thoroughly crushing Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to rely on the southwest and plan a comeback. During the strategic pursuits, in some areas, local forces colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's retreating troops and attempted to occupy advantageous positions and resist. Our army adopted the policy of annihilating them on the spot. The Central Military Commission demanded that the troops launch fierce attacks and pursuits, divide and encircle, and annihilate each one. For example, our Northwest Field Army, after annihilating the main force of Hu Zongnan, quickly annihilated local forces such as Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui, and advanced to Xinjiang, liberating the northwest region. In the strategic pursuits, we fully exerted the power of political offensive, prompting the enemy to revolt, surrender, or undergo peaceful transformation. Mao Zedong timely proposed the "three ways" to disarm the enemy, namely the "Tianjin way", the "Beiping way", and the "Suiyuan way". The "Tianjin way" is to solve the enemy through battle and resolutely annihilate all enemies that dare to resist. The "Beiping way" is to force the enemy to accept peaceful transformation under our powerful military strikes and tight encirclement. The "Suiyuan way" is to deliberately keep a part of the Kuomintang army intact or largely intact, so as to concentrate our forces to solve the enemy's main part first, and then carry out transformation at the appropriate time. In our advance into the southwest and northwest regions, we won over around 800,000 enemy troops to revolt or surrender. This is a great victory for the strategic struggle strategy of the Central Committee.
Section 1 : Party building is a great undertaking 
I. The ideological basis for the construction of the Communist Party of China is the inheritance and development of Marxist-Leninist party-building theory.
Marx and Engels first put forward the theory of establishing a proletarian revolutionary party. Marx pointed out that in the struggle against the united power of the bourgeoisie, the working class can only act as a class by organizing itself into an independent party that opposes all the old political parties established by the bourgeoisie. It is necessary for the working class to organize itself in this way as a political party in order to guarantee the victory of social revolution and realize the ultimate goal of this revolution, which is the abolition of classes. In order to guide the revolutionary struggle of the working class, Marx and Engels created a scientific and comprehensive communist ideological system and guided the establishment of revolutionary organizations of the proletariat, such as the "Communist League", the "First International", and the German Social Democratic Party, thereby opening up a new stage in the revolutionary struggle of the world proletariat and working people. This is their great historical achievement.
However, Marx and Engels lived in an era when the proletariat had already stepped onto the historical stage, but the revolutionary tasks of the proletariat were not yet fully mature. After the failure of the revolutions in various Western European countries in 1848, capitalism entered a period of peaceful development.The Paris Commune uprising in 1871 was the first brave attempt by the proletariat to seize power. However, the practice of the struggle showed that the objective conditions for seizing power were not sufficient. The world's first batch of proletarian party organizations established after this period, in various European and American countries, were corroded and degenerated by opportunism and revisionism due to the relatively "peaceful" nature of this period, leading to their subsequent bankruptcy. Therefore, when history entered the early 20th century, the task of establishing a new type of proletarian revolutionary party was put forward to adapt to the fully matured revolutionary crisis and the task of leading the revolution. It was under these historical conditions that Lenin established a completely new type of proletarian revolutionary party - the Russian Bolshevik Party, and "specially created a complete theory of building a proletarian revolutionary party".
Lenin proposed the task of establishing a new type of proletarian revolutionary party. Lenin pointed out: what we need is a new type of party, a party of a different nature. He also said: transform the old type of party that is essentially European parliamentary and only superficially revolutionary and colored with reformism into a truly revolutionary and truly communist new type of party. Lenin strongly emphasized that the party must be a new type, which means it must have fundamental differences from the Second International parliamentary and reformist parties of various countries. When the parties of the Second International were established, although they were also proletarian parties, after the death of Engels, they degenerated and transformed into appendages of the parliamentary parties of the bourgeoisie due to the corrosion of Bernstein's revisionism, losing their revolutionary nature and combat effectiveness. They were no longer revolutionary parties of the proletariat, but parties of reformism, old-type parties. Lenin believed that in the early 20th century, it was necessary to establish a new type of proletarian party. This kind of party should be a revolutionary party with high class consciousness, fighting spirit, mass contact, and discipline. Only by establishing such a revolutionary party can the needs posed by history in the era of imperialism be met and the revolutionary tasks of the proletariat be accomplished.
Lenin elucidated that the ideological foundation of the proletarian revolutionary party must be Marxism and that construction must start with ideology. When creating the Bolshevik Party, Lenin wrote works such as "Where to Begin" and "What Is to Be Done", firmly opposed the economism of worshiping workers' spontaneity, and formulated the party's line of founding a nationwide political newspaper to propagate Marxism and unify ideological understanding. Lenin said, "We base ourselves entirely on the theory of Marxism, because it was the first time that socialism was transformed from utopia into science, establishing a solid foundation for this science." He emphasized that "only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of advanced fighters."
Lenin explicitly stipulated the relationship between the party and the proletariat and put forward the principle that the ideological unity of the party must be consolidated through the material unity of its organization. Lenin pointed out that the party is the advanced force and organized force of the proletariat, the highest form of organization of the proletariat. The party must be composed of the most conscious and advanced elements of the proletariat. Party members can only be a minority of the proletariat, never its entirety. The party should be organized on the basis of democratic centralism, with party members obeying unified discipline and safeguarding party unity, without allowing factional activities. The party must lead all other organizations of the proletariat. Lenin said, "In the struggle for power, the proletariat has no weapons other than organization. The reason why the proletariat can become and will inevitably become an invincible force is that the ideological unity formed based on the principles of Marxism is consolidated through material unity of organization."
The above three points are the main content of Lenin's party building theory. It points out the most basic direction for the construction of a proletarian revolutionary party and has universal significance. The Communist Party of China was also founded and developed under the guidance of these Leninist principles.
However, like many general principles of Marxism-Leninism, the principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding a certain class of things only reflect the most general laws of the development of these things and cannot encompass all the complexities and diversities of these things in phenomena. Lenin's party building ideas reflect the most general laws of the development of proletarian political parties, but they cannot and cannot encompass all the characteristics of the development of proletarian political parties in various countries. Due to the differences in historical conditions in various countries, the establishment and development of proletarian political parties in various countries must inevitably have their own characteristics and special laws. Therefore, the party building theory of Marxism-Leninism always needs to be constantly enriched and developed with the construction of proletarian political parties in various countries. The thinking and experience of the Communist Party of China in building the Communist Party of China under the historical conditions of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China is a model that adheres to the combination, enrichment, and development of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution.
The Communist Party of China was born in old China, which was semi-colonial and semi-feudal. On the one hand, the severity and cruelty of the exploitation and oppression suffered by the Chinese working class is rare among all countries in the world. Their revolutionary thoroughness is most prominent and their combativeness is the strongest, which provides a good class foundation for the party's establishment and development. As Liu Shaoqi said, our party has had a clear class consciousness since its inception, and it has led China's bourgeois democratic revolution from the standpoint of the proletariat, combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese workers' movement and the Chinese revolution. It has various excellent styles of an advanced party of the proletariat, and thus has brought a new face to the Chinese revolution. On the other hand, our party was established in a large oriental country with backward economy and culture, where the majority of the population were peasants and petty bourgeoisie. Our party is not only surrounded by the petty bourgeoisie from outside the party, but also the majority of the party members come from a petty bourgeoisie background. In addition, under China's economic conditions, even the working masses and worker members are prone to be influenced by petty bourgeoisie ideology. Therefore, petty bourgeoisie ideology often has various reflections within our party. This is inevitable and not surprising. It is precisely because of this reason that the contradiction between the proletarian ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies, especially the petty bourgeoisie ideology, has become the main contradiction within the party. The process of building the Communist Party of China is a process of constantly transforming the petty bourgeoisie elements within the party and overcoming various non-proletarian ideologies with proletarian ideology.
If we say that before the 1930s, the situation of the construction of the Communist Party of China was not very prominent because the party's basic activities were not very clear in the cities, then after the party's work shifted to the countryside, this problem became particularly prominent.
After the failure of the Great Revolution, Chinese communists led by Mao Zedong, after suffering setbacks in armed uprisings in various places, began to go deep into the countryside to explore a revolutionary path suitable for China's national conditions. On September 9, 1927, Mao Zedong launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and soon the forces moved into Jinggangshan. In the process of building the revolutionary base in Jinggangshan, Mao Zedong explored the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities with the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle. Mao Zedong pointed out that the Communist Party of China must take the path of surrounding the cities with the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle.He believes that 90% of the Chinese economy is agricultural production, while capitalist commodity production represents only a small proportion and is concentrated in large cities. Agricultural production is carried out by decentralized small producers, maintaining a great deal of independence and self-sufficiency. In terms of politics, the ruling class has strong power in the cities but weak power in the countryside. This economic and political imbalance allows our party to have the conditions to lead the armed struggle of the peasants and establish revolutionary base areas in the countryside. In the 1930s, Mao Zedong's thinking on the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities with the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle had basically taken shape, and in practice, the party's work focus had shifted from the cities to the countryside. With the Jinggangshan revolutionary base area as a representative, revolutionary armed forces were successively established in various areas, and land reform was carried out deepening the new situation had already opened up.
The shift of the party's work focus to the countryside has made the tasks of party construction even more arduous. This is because, with the shift of the party's work focus to the countryside, there has been a significant change in the composition of the party's organization. In March 1927, the total number of party members in the party was 57,967, with workers accounting for 53.8% and peasants accounting for 18.7%. However, by 1928 during the period of the land revolution war, out of 130,194 party members, workers accounted for 10.9% and peasants accounted for 76.6%. In 1929, the number of workers as party members dropped to 7.5%, and in July 1930, it dropped further to 5.5%, and in September, it dropped to 1.6%. With the majority of members being peasants, did our party become a peasant party? At that time, the view of the Communist International was that none of the party cadres in China were workers, which resulted in the failure of the great revolution. They purely emphasized that party members should come from a working-class background, believing that the party's organization should be replaced by worker cadres instead of non-worker cadres, and that the Red Army should also be composed of individuals from a working-class background. When the 6th National Congress of the Party was held, due to the emphasis on worker representation by the Communist International, out of the 75 delegates, 41 were workers, and when electing Central Committee members, they only emphasized the worker component, with 21 out of 36 Central Committee members being workers. However, the majority of these elected Central Committee members had not directly participated in actual revolutionary struggles.
The Communist Party of China has put forward a different approach to party construction in the rural environment from the Third International's line. First, the party recognized the seriousness of this problem. During the process of establishing revolutionary base areas, Mao Zedong felt that "the issue of proletarian ideological leadership is a very important one. The parties in various counties on the border were almost entirely composed of peasants, and if they are not provided with proletarian ideological leadership, they will inevitably deviate." Secondly, Mao Zedong analyzed the reasons for various errors such as a purely military viewpoint, extreme democratization, non-organizational viewpoint, absolute egalitarianism, subjectivism, individualism, banditry, and blind activism. It was pointed out that the source of various incorrect ideas within the party was naturally due to the fact that the majority of the party's organizational base was composed of elements from the peasant and other petty-bourgeoisie classes. However, the leadership organs of the party lacked a consistent and resolute struggle against these incorrect ideas, and a lack of education on the correct line for party members, which was also an important reason for the existence and development of these incorrect ideas. Finally, Mao Zedong emphasized not a simple method of purging on the organizational level, but rather a method of strengthening ideological education within the party and raising the party's theoretical level. Afterward, Mao Zedong elaborated on this problem in articles such as "Oppose Book Worship," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Inaugural Address of the Journal 'Communist'" and took a road to build a vanguard of the proletariat under the conditions where the majority of the population were peasants and the petty bourgeoisie had a strong influence within the party.
II. The theory of the Communist Party of China's party building was formed and developed in practice. 
Chinese communists, represented by Mao Zedong, have enriched and developed the theory of Marxist-Leninist party building through long-term revolutionary struggles and party building.
The process of the formation and development of the theory of party building in the Communist Party of China is consistent with the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought and is based on the development of the Chinese revolutionary history and the party's revolutionary activities in various historical periods.It is the summary of the correct party-building theory principles and experiences that have been proved by the construction practice of the Communist Party of China, and it is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. From 1920 to 1927, the Chinese Communists made valuable explorations on how to establish a new type of proletarian party in our country. During this period, under the influence of the October Revolution in Russia and the May Fourth Movement in China, and with the assistance of the Communist International led by Lenin, the Chinese Communists had begun to establish the nature of the party, its basic program, and organizational principles. The first party congress established the goal of establishing proletarian dictatorship as the party's struggle goal. The second party congress clearly put forward the party's democratic revolution program of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Soon after its founding, the Party led the vigorous revolutionary struggle, and the party members performed outstandingly in the struggle, and the party organization also developed greatly. During this period, our Party began to realize the importance of strengthening its own construction. At the Second Party Congress in 1922, it was proposed to strengthen the training of party members in ideology, politics, and organization, and it was pointed out that when cooperating with the bourgeois democratic parties, the Party must maintain its independence. At the Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee held in November 1923, it was proposed to educate party members and the masses with the dialectical materialistic worldview and collectivism outlook on life, and emphasized the need to fight against individualism. This shows that at the beginning of the party's establishment, our Party paid attention to the ideological transformation of party members. Since then, at almost every congress and expanded meeting of the Central Committee, corresponding resolutions have been made on the issues of party organization and propaganda and education. In the Resolution on the Third Amendment to the Party Constitution passed in June 1927, "Party Building" was explicitly discussed as a separate chapter. However, the Party during this period was still a young party after all. Due to limited understanding of Marxism-Leninism and insufficient theoretical preparation, the Party had just been established and immediately engaged in mass struggles, and had limited understanding of the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, and lacked experience in party building. Especially, there was not yet a conscious understanding of the integration of Marxist-Leninist party-building theory with the construction practice of the Communist Party of China, and the Party itself had not yet formed its strong leadership core, the party organization had not been able to consolidate, and the party members lacked necessary Marxist-Leninist education, and many party experiences could not be well summarized. Therefore, it was not possible to form a more systematic theory of party building during this period, and the thought of party building was still in its infancy.
From the August 7th Meeting in 1927 to the Zunyi Meeting in 1935, the Communist Party of China began to explore how to build a party in the Red Army, how to build a party in armed struggle, and how to build a party in the revolutionary base areas in rural areas, based on the combination of theory and practice. It created many new experiences and solved many major theoretical and practical problems that Marx, Engels, and Lenin had not encountered or mentioned, and began to form a basic path of party building with Chinese characteristics. The basic points of this path are: First, it established the principle of emphasizing party building from an ideological perspective and proposed using proletarian ideology to overcome various non-proletarian ideologies. In response to the large influx of peasant revolutionary elements into the Party and the serious presence of petty-bourgeois ideologies within the Party, the "Resolution of the Gutian Meeting" (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution") pointed out that party members must establish a proletarian revolutionary outlook on life; it is necessary to overcome and rectify various non-proletarian ideological consciousness within the Party, especially various petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, to ensure the dominant position of proletarian ideology within the Party; it is necessary to carry out serious and solemn criticism and self-criticism, and actively carry out correct internal struggle within the Party. This is the basic way to strengthen proletarian ideology and eliminate all non-proletarian ideological consciousness. The above principles and methods initially formed the basic principle of party building from an ideological perspective, laying a foundation for strengthening the ideological construction of the Party in the future. Emphasizing party building from an ideological perspective has become a prominent characteristic of the construction of the Communist Party of China.
Second, it proposed a scientific concept of party organization line, emphasizing the need to strengthen the construction of party members and grassroots organizations...
The "Resolution" proposes the scientific concept of the "Party's organizational line" and expounds on the issues of organizational construction under the guidance of the Party's organizational line. Firstly, the "Resolution" emphasizes the strengthening of the Party's grassroots organizations. The grassroots organizations exist and operate among the masses of soldiers, serving as the bridge and link between the Party and the masses. Therefore, the "Resolution" reaffirms that "for each company, there should be a branch, for each platoon, there should be a group", which is one of the important principles of party organization in the military. "Branches should be established at the company level" is an important measure to strengthen the Party's leadership in the military, making the branches become strong fortresses of grassroots organizations.
To improve the combat effectiveness of the Party organization, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of Party members. This is the primary issue in organizational construction. Mao Zedong established the correct line for the development of Party members for the Red Army, emphasizing that "the main target for developing Party members is the soldiers". He also proposed that strict conditions and procedures for Party membership must be upheld in order to guarantee the purity and combat effectiveness of the Party's membership.
The issue of democratic life within the Party is the core content of the Party's organizational construction. Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle of the Communist Party of China, as well as the fundamental guideline for promoting democratic life within the Party. The "Resolution" addresses the extreme tendency towards excessive democracy within the Red Army, emphasizing that democratic life within the Party must be maintained under centralized guidance. The so-called democracy that deviates from the Party line, policies, and leadership is not genuine proletarian democracy, but extreme democratization of the petty bourgeoisie, which must be opposed.
Third, it proposes the valuable idea of Party's political construction, emphasizing that Party construction must be combined with the construction of the Red political power. Mao Zedong stated in the articles "Struggles at Jinggangshan" and "Why the Red Political Power Can Exist?" that the strength of the Communist Party's organization and the correctness of its political line are the fundamental conditions for the long-term existence of the Red political power. He also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's self-construction and expand and strengthen the Party's organization during the process of establishing the Red political power, in order to truly make the Communist Party a strong core of the Red political power. This indicates that although Mao Zedong had not yet fully summarized the laws of party building centered around the political line at that time, its basic ideas had been put forward.
Fourth, it puts forward the scientific concepts and basic ideas of the Party's ideological line and mass line. Mao Zedong, in the struggle against "left" dogmatism, proposed the scientific concept and basic ideas of the ideological line in the article "Oppose Book Worship". Simultaneously, in the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the document "Concerning the People's Livelihood and Paying Attention to Work Methods", he put forward the scientific concept and basic ideas of the "mass line".
In addition, during this period, our Party also created invaluable experience in carrying out inner-party struggles and established the principle of the Party's absolute leadership over the Red Army, among other things. During this period, the Party focused on solving the problem of ideological and political construction, aiming to ensure the vanguard nature of the Party and achieve strong Party leadership. Although the series of party building principles mentioned above were not mature and complete at that time, the basic points on how to maintain the vanguard nature of the Party in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, as well as how to achieve Party leadership, had been put forward and formed the basis of an organic theoretical system. This is the result of the creative combination of Marxist-Leninist party theory and the actual construction of the Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong. It marks the initial formation of the path of party building with Chinese characteristics during this period. The Zunyi Conference held in 1935 established Mao Zedong's leadership position in the Red Army and the whole Party, which provided crucial political conditions for the further promotion and application of Mao Zedong's party building line throughout the Party, and for its maturity and completeness during the Yan'an Rectification Movement.
From the Zunyi Conference in 1935 to the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945. This period is an important period for our party to transform from setbacks to continuous victories and for the rapid development and strengthening of the party organization. It is also a period when the party's construction path with Chinese characteristics matured. During this stage, the Party Central Committee, led by Mao Zedong, put forward the great task of building a mass-based and more Bolshevik Marxist political party. In the process of achieving this task, Comrade Mao Zedong and others deeply summarized the experience and lessons of party building since its establishment. They made many reports on party building, wrote numerous works on party building, drafted many important documents, and led the whole party in carrying out the famous Yan'an Rectification Movement. They created effective forms of party building, explored the issue of party building in the combination of theory and practice, further developed and improved the ideological system and path of party building established during the period of the establishment of the Red Army. 
In the early stage of this period, Mao Zedong wrote two works, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction", focusing on criticising dogmatism and systematically expounding the ideological line of dialectical materialism and the scientific worldview of the party, laying the philosophical foundation for the party's ideological construction. Subsequently, Mao Zedong emphasized the importance of studying Marxism and improving theoretical level at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party. On October 20, 1939, the CPC Central Committee established the "Communist" magazine in Yan'an. Mao Zedong wrote the inaugural speech of "Communist" and put forward the task of "building a nationwide, mass-based, ideologically, politically and organizationally solid, and thoroughly Bolshevik Chinese Communist Party". He likened the construction of such a party to a "great project" and summarized the party's 18 years of experience. From 1939 to the pre-Yan'an Rectification Movement, Mao Zedong also published works such as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party", "The Absorption of a Large Number of Intellectuals", and "On Policy". During this period, Liu Shaoqi wrote works such as "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members", "On Inner-Party Struggles", "Be a Good Party Member, Build a Good Party"; Chen Yun published articles such as "On Cadre Policy", "How to Be a Communist Party Member", "Several Issues on Cadre Construction"; Zhang Wentian published articles such as "Organizational Work Should Be Sinicized", "Briefly Discussing the Relationship Between the Party and Non-Party Masses", "Advocating a Simple and Pragmatic Working Style". These works on party building further enriched the theoretical aspect of the "great project" and improved the ideological construction of the Communist Party of China. 
At the same time, the preliminary ideas of the party's political construction have also been further developed. During this period, Mao Zedong and other communist party members put forward the following basic points on the party's political construction: the party's building must be combined with the party's political line and political strategies; the party must formulate a correct political line and correct policy strategies. Emphasis should be placed on raising the political consciousness of the whole party and developing and strengthening the organization in the process of implementing the political line. The party's construction must be combined with united front work and armed struggle. The party's construction is of decisive significance to the success or failure of the Chinese revolution. The united front and armed struggle are the two fundamental weapons to defeat the enemy, and the party organization is the heroic fighter who wields these two weapons to charge against the enemy. When the party's construction is done well, the party will be better able to grasp and use these two weapons of united front work and armed struggle, correctly lead the Chinese revolution, and lead it to victory. 
While dealing with the ideological line and political line of the party, Mao Zedong and other communist party members also effectively resolved a series of problems in organizational construction. In his article "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War", Mao Zedong comprehensively and systematically expounded the party's organizational line and organizational construction issues, focusing on the "virtue and talent" criteria for selecting cadres and the "appointing the virtuous" approach to using cadres. He emphasized the need to care for and cherish cadres, comprehensively unite cadres, and treat cadres who make mistakes correctly.At the same time, the fundamental principles for carrying out the struggle on two fronts were proposed. In addition, in the reports and other articles written by Mao Zedong and other Communist Party members, a systematic exposition of various issues related to party organization construction, such as democratic centralism, was presented, thus forming a relatively complete theoretical system regarding party organization construction.
After resolving the ideological and organizational lines of the party, starting from 1942, the Communist Party of China launched the famous Yan'an Rectification Movement. Through this movement, the Communist Party systematically summarized and continuously improved party construction, especially establishing a set of comprehensive theoretical principles and guiding policies regarding party style construction.The purpose of strengthening the party's construction is to achieve the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China in the revolutionary cause. Regarding the principles of party leadership, in the early stage of the anti-Japanese war, Mao Zedong and other Communist Party members further expounded the historical inevitability of achieving party leadership, and raised basic conditions, principles, approaches, and methods to realize party leadership, thereby initially forming a theoretical system regarding party leadership. During the Yan'an Rectification period, Mao Zedong and other Communist Party members further discussed the principles, approaches, and methods of achieving party leadership, making the principles of party leadership more comprehensive.
During these ten years, our party became more mature in terms of ideology and politics, and more consolidated in terms of organization. Mao Zedong and others formed a complete set of theoretical principles regarding what kind of party to establish, and how to construct this party in terms of ideology, politics, organization, and style. They also formed a set of theoretical principles for correctly carrying out the struggle against the two lines within the party, which successfully guided the construction of the Communist Party of China. Liu Shaoqi summarized the theoretical system of our party's construction at the 7th Party Congress, explicitly proposing the scientific concepts of "Mao Zedong's Party-building Theory" and "Mao Zedong's Party-building Line". This indicates that the theoretical system of Mao Zedong's Party-building Theory has been fully formed, and the party construction path with Chinese characteristics has matured.
From the victory of the anti-Japanese war to the eve of the establishment of New China, the party's organization and membership further expanded, and the principles of democratic centralism and the system of collective leadership were further improved. The ideological thinking, especially the thinking about organizational construction, of the Communist Party of China further developed.
Firstly, from the victory of the anti-Japanese war to the National Land Conference in July 1947. In order to adapt to the situation of large-scale war, the Party Central Committee timely adopted measures such as cadre adjustments and organizational reorganizations. While strengthening the party's leadership in various regions, a large number of party members were recruited, which strengthened the party's strength.
Secondly, from the National Land Conference to the Second Plenary Session of the 7th Party Central Committee in March 1949. In order to support the strategic counteroffensive and strategic decisive battle of the People's Liberation Army, the Party Central Committee rectified the party in conjunction with land reform in various liberated areas, and successively made instructions and decisions on enhancing policy awareness, strengthening discipline, improving the system of democratic centralism and collective leadership, effectively correcting the "left" tendencies that emerged during land reform and party rectification, overcoming  some disorganized and undisciplined phenomena within the party, ensuring the centralized and unified leadership of the central authority, and implementing various guidelines and policies to effectively support the war.
Finally, from the Second Plenary Session of the 7th Party Central Committee to September 1949. As the revolution was about to achieve victory nationwide, the focus of the party's work began to shift from rural to urban areas, and the party's activities had shifted from secrecy to openness. The party started to transition from an illegal and long-oppressed position to a ruling party position. The Party Central Committee promptly formulated measures to prevent the encroachment of bourgeois ideology and prohibit the glorification of individuals, calling on the whole party to maintain a humble, cautious, non-arrogant, non-rash style of work, and put forth the principle of open party construction, making necessary preparations for the construction of the ruling party in terms of ideology and politics.
During this period, due to the rapid expansion of the party organization and party members, the rapid growth of revolutionary forces, and the war forms of large-scale mobile warfare and positional warfare, it is even more necessary to strengthen the coordination and unified action of party organizations at all levels. Therefore, the Party Central Committee emphasized the principles of centralized and unified leadership and collective leadership, which consolidated the unity and unity of the party and provided an important guarantee for the nationwide victory.
III. The basic characteristics of party building during the period of the new democratic revolution
The special conditions and circumstances experienced by the Communist Party of China during the period of the new democratic revolution are the fundamental starting point for the construction and development of the Communist Party. Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, successfully solved the problem of building a Marxist proletarian political party with a broad mass base through continuously recognizing and mastering these basic characteristics and created a party construction theory in line with the development laws of our party. The basic characteristics of the construction of the Communist Party of China during the period of the new democratic revolution are manifested in the following aspects:
First, the establishment of the Communist Party of China was based on the Chinese workers' movement after the October Revolution, modeled after Lenin's Bolshevik Party, and established according to the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism. From the very beginning, our party was not influenced by the Second International of the Social Democratic Party in terms of ideology and organization. China did not have a period of capitalist "peaceful" development like Europe, which allowed for peaceful parliamentary struggle of the working class, nor did it have a labor aristocracy like Europe. Therefore, our party was armed with Marxism-Leninism from its inception and did not have the reformist tradition of the Social Democratic Party.
Second, the construction and development of the Communist Party of China had a very close relationship with the guidance of the Communist International. From July 1922 when our party declared its membership in the Communist International, to May 1943 when the Communist International dissolved, the Communist Party of China was a branch under the leadership of the Communist International. In the long-term struggle of the Chinese Revolution, on the one hand, the Communist International did indeed play a positive role in assisting the construction and development of the Communist Party of China. Our party's programs and policies of united front, the Northern Expedition, the land revolution, the resistance against Japan, etc. all received support and assistance from the Communist International and Stalin. On the other hand, the Communist International and Stalin also made mistakes in their guidance and interference, which almost plunged the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Revolution into difficulties. Chen Duxiu's rightist mistake and Wang Ming's "left" mistake were directly related to blindly following the erroneous instructions of the Communist International and the erroneous opinions of Stalin. It can be said that the construction, progress, victory, and setbacks of our party are inseparable from the guidance of the Communist International.
Third, the proportion of peasants and petty bourgeoisie in the Communist Party of China is quite large, which is the social basis for the occurrence of "left" and rightist deviations within our party. Chinese semi-colonial and semi-feudal society is a society with a minority of workers and landlords and bourgeoisie, and the majority consists of peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and other intermediate classes. Our party developed and grew in the revolutionary coalition of Chinese peasants and other petty bourgeoisie. China did not form a powerful petty bourgeoisie political party, so it was inevitable for a large number of revolutionaries from petty bourgeoisie backgrounds to join the proletarian revolutionary party. However, this has led to a significant proportion of peasants and petty bourgeoisie within our party, and the opposition and struggle between the thinking of the working class and petty bourgeoisie has become the most essential contradiction within the party. In this situation, how to build a revolutionary party of the working class has become a major issue facing our party.
Fourth, the Communist Party of China was tempered in the struggle against the bourgeoisie. During the period of the new democratic revolution, our party established revolutionary united fronts with the bourgeoisie several times, and after these united fronts broke, fierce armed struggles were waged against the big bourgeoisie and its allies.In general, during the process of the New Democratic Revolution, when our party forms a united front with the bourgeoisie, the party is prone to rightist deviations; and during the period of our party's split with the bourgeoisie, the party is prone to leftist deviations. Therefore, correctly handling the relationship between our party and the bourgeoisie is another important issue in the construction of our party.
Fifthly, the Communist Party of China has been tempered through long-term armed struggles. Armed struggle is the characteristic and advantage of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, and it is the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. During the democratic revolution, our party engaged in long-term domestic revolutionary wars and national liberation wars. The majority of party members and cadres lived a collective military life, undergoing rigorous training in ideology, organization, and daily life, and establishing close ties with the masses, sharing both hardships and blessings. Therefore, the construction of the party is closely related to the correct handling of the issue of armed struggle. How to build and develop the party in armed struggle is another important issue in the party's construction.
Sixthly, the Communist Party of China has developed and grown in the long-term leadership of the construction and struggle in rural revolutionary base areas. After 1927, our party opened up the road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing power through armed struggle. In order to accumulate and strengthen their own strength, the revolutionary forces have long been deeply involved in rural areas, transforming backward rural areas into advanced and solid base areas, creating great revolutionary positions militarily, politically, economically, and culturally, and gradually achieving the complete victory of the revolution. In the countryside, in addition to prioritizing the solution of the party's own construction, the party must also lead the people in building political power, economic development, and cultural development, acquiring a comprehensive set of skills in governing the country and ensuring the people's security. Therefore, how to build a revolutionary political party of the working class armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, with strict discipline, and centralized unity, in the divided, guerrilla warfare-oriented, and decentralized individual economy-based rural base areas facing enemy divisions, is a new issue that the Communist Party of China has encountered in the history of international communist movements without precedent.
In summary, it can be seen that the historical conditions, social environment, and class relations in which the Communist Party of China exists, as well as the revolutionary path and forms of struggle it has experienced, all have great uniqueness. This requires that the Chinese Communists must have great originality, combining the principles of Marxist-Leninist party building theory with the specific practices of the Communist Party of China. Mao Zedong's theory of party building is precisely the response to this historical requirement, forming and developing in the practice of leading the people in revolution and construction.
Section 2: Ideological Construction of the Party
I. Emphasizing the ideological construction of the party is a prominent feature of the construction theory of the Communist Party of China. 
It is an outstanding contribution by Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, to the Marxist-Leninist party theory. It has played a decisive role in the establishment, consolidation, and development of the Communist Party of China, as well as in maintaining the party's nature as a vanguard of the working class and its leadership role.
Building the party ideologically is an important principle of Marxist-Leninist party building theory. 
The founders of the proletarian party theory, Marx and Engels, attached importance to the role of revolutionary theory and the ideological construction of the party from the beginning of party building. They advocated combining scientific socialist theory with the workers' movement and using this theory to educate the entire party. Marx pointed out in the "Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right": "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace the criticism of weapons; material force can only be overthrown by material force. But once the masses grasp the theory, it also becomes a material force." In the Communist Manifesto published by Marx and Engels in 1848, it further explicitly stated: "In practice, communist parties are the most resolute and always advancing part of the workers' parties in each country. In theory, their superiority over the other proletarian masses lies in their understanding of the conditions, process, and general results of the proletarian movement.Later, Engels summarized the experience of party building by saying, "Our party has a great advantage, which is having a new scientific worldview as its theoretical foundation." This scientific worldview is the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of Marxism, which is the greatest ideological weapon for communists to understand and transform the world. With the development of the proletarian revolution, the expansion of the party's ranks, and the theoretical victory of Marxism, not only awakened workers demanded to participate in party organizations, but also non-proletarian individuals from other classes flocked to the ranks of the proletarian political parties. This inevitably caused the proletarian political parties to be influenced by various non-proletarian ideas and consciousness. Therefore, Marx and Engels not only emphasized the class nature of the party, pointing out that the party is composed of advanced elements of the working class and is a part that always propels the movement forward, they also emphasized the party's advanced nature, stating that the party must have a new scientific worldview as its theoretical foundation, and they put forward specific requirements for strengthening the party's construction in terms of ideology: "If these individuals from other classes participate in the proletarian movement, the first requirement is that they do not bring any remnants of the prejudices of the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, etc. and unconditionally grasp the proletarian worldview." They also stressed the need to "completely break with traditional ownership relations" and "completely break with traditional ideas." In order to maintain the proletariat's advanced nature, Marx and Engels put forward strict ideological requirements for non-proletarian members joining the party: "First, these individuals must bring truly enlightening factors that are beneficial to the proletarian movement; second, if these individuals from other classes participate in the proletarian movement, the first requirement is that they do not bring any remnants of the prejudices of the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, etc. and unconditionally grasp the proletarian worldview." These important thoughts of Marx and Engels have pointed out the direction for the ideological construction of proletarian political parties and established a theoretical foundation.
Leninism is the Marxism of the imperialist and proletarian revolution era. Lenin not only established the new type of proletarian political party in Russia - the Bolshevik Party, but also inherited, defended, and developed Marxist doctrines about the party. When Lenin was founding the party, he was facing the comprehensive betrayal of Marxism by the Second International and the denial of the role of revolutionary theory by Russian Economism. Therefore, at the beginning of building the party in Russia, Lenin paid great attention to the significant role of revolutionary theory in constructing a new type of proletarian political party. Lenin specifically pointed out that instilling socialist ideas into the working class is a continuous and fundamental task of the party. From the very beginning of party building, he criticized spontaneity and emphasized the "instillation" of theory. He pointed out, "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no strong socialist party." "Only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of advanced fighters." He also sharply pointed out, "Without theory, revolutionary factions will lose their right to exist and are destined to fail politically sooner or later." In Lenin's view, "Whether a party is truly a workers' party not only depends on whether it is composed of workers, but also on who leads it and the content of its actions and political strategies. Only based on the latter can we determine whether this party is a genuine proletarian political party." Here, Lenin has already regarded the dominance of a certain ideology within the party as the fundamental condition determining the nature of the proletarian political party. "If in the party, the thinking of revisionists really predominates, then it is not a socialist political party of the working class." These important statements by Lenin enriched the theory of building a Marxist party.
Therefore, without revolutionary theory, there cannot be a strong proletarian political party. The nature of the party does not depend on the background of its members, but on its guiding ideology and political line. This is the theoretical basis for emphasizing the construction of the party from an ideological perspective. Building the party from an ideological perspective is determined by the national conditions of China.
The Communist Party of China is a proletarian party established based on the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism. Marx and Lenin believed that the establishment of a proletarian party could only become a reality when both the class conditions and theoretical conditions were met and combined. In China, by the time of the May Fourth Movement, the establishment of the Communist Party of China had already met the class and theoretical conditions. At that time, the number of industrial workers had increased to two million, and they had taken an independent stance on the political stage, engaging in strikes and struggles in many central cities. This demonstrated the unparalleled revolutionary determination, thoroughness, and immense combat power of the Chinese proletariat compared to any other class. A group of advanced individuals with preliminary communist ideas recognized the strength of the working class and were determined to carry out propaganda, education, and organizational work among the workers, thereby promoting the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese workers' movement. The great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May Fourth Movement achieved this combination. After the May Fourth Movement, early Communist Party organizations centered on cities were successively established in Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Shandong, as well as among Chinese students studying in Japan and France, and conducted extensive activities among the working masses. The Chinese workers' movement found its spiritual weapon in Marxism, and Marxism found its material strength in the Chinese workers' movement. The combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese workers' movement gave birth to the Communist Party of China. After the Party's establishment, it firstly developed among cities and the working class, and carried out vigorous strike struggles. However, the practice of the revolutionary struggle of the Communist Party of China demonstrated significant differences in the social environment, class relations, and revolutionary path compared to communist parties in European countries. Therefore, in its own construction, the Communist Party of China encountered major issues that had not been encountered by communist parties in European countries. This is because old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society where imperialism and feudal forces colluded to bring about deep national oppression and class oppression. The feudal exploitation system had a clear advantage in the socio-economic life, while although there was some development in national capitalism, its strength was weak. This resulted in China having a social structure where the extremes were small and the middle was large. The landlords, bourgeoisie, and working class accounted for only a minority of the population, while the majority consisted of peasants and other petite bourgeoisie. This basic characteristic of Chinese society determined that for the Communist Party of China to become strong and shoulder the revolutionary task of saving the country and the people, it was far from enough to rely solely on the strength of its own class. It was necessary to recruit enthusiastic peasants and other petite bourgeoisie who were sincere in revolution, believed in revolutionary ideology, supported the party's policies, and were willing to obey discipline and work hard, in order to make the party a great mass party. Furthermore, as cities were the base of enemy occupation and the countryside was a relatively weak area for imperialist and feudal rule, it was difficult for the party's organization to exist and develop primarily in cities. Its broad space was in the countryside, where it had to develop and strengthen, and lead workers and peasants in armed struggles. 
After the failure of the 1927 revolution, the party's focus gradually shifted from cities to the countryside. The party moved away from the central cities and the masses of its own class. Since then, the party has existed and developed in the countryside. On one hand, the party lives in the countryside, surrounded by the vast mass of farmers and petite bourgeoisie due to its residence relationship. On the other hand, the party primarily recruits members from the mass of farmers and petite bourgeoisie. In such unique social conditions, constructing a truly Marxist and highly pure proletarian party is undoubtedly an extremely challenging task. As Mao Zedong said, "The organization of the party in villages, due to the residential relationship, often has one branch composed of members from one surname, and branch meetings are practically family meetings. In this situation, the construction of a 'fighting Bolshevik party' is truly quite difficult."The difficulty lies in the fact that various non-proletarian ideologies, mainly those of the petite bourgeoisie, constantly attack the Communist Party from all directions. At the same time, the petite bourgeoisie ideology, which has not yet been overcome within the party, occasionally causes trouble. In this situation, it is both crucial and extremely challenging to maintain the proletarian nature of the party and the purity of communism. Chinese Communists, led by Mao Zedong, guided by Marxist-Leninist party-building theory, conducted a specific analysis of the unique characteristics of establishing a proletarian party in China, different from other countries in Europe. It was pointed out that "the issue of leadership by proletarian ideology is a very important one. The party in the border counties is almost entirely composed of peasants. If it is not led by proletarian ideology, it will tend to be wrong." Emphasis was placed on building the party ideologically, placing ideological construction at the forefront of party-building. This successfully addressed the major issue of how to transform the party into a proletarian revolutionary party in a Chinese society with a small number of workers but a large majority of peasants and other petite bourgeoisie. 
The ideological construction of the party is the prerequisite and foundation for all other aspects of party-building. The construction of ideological theory is the central link of party-building, running through all aspects of party-building and serving as the prerequisite and foundation for all other aspects of party-building. The ideological construction of the party is an important prerequisite for the political construction of the party. In the political construction of the party, the determination of the party's political line, the formulation of party strategies and policies, and the determination of political tasks in various historical periods of the party all require correct and scientific theoretical guidance, all of which are based on ideological line. The correctness of the ideological line directly determines the correctness of the political line. For the political construction of the party, the role of the party's theoretical construction is mainly demonstrated in three aspects. First, the party can only correctly observe and analyze the situation, put forward correct political tasks, and formulate correct political lines and policies if it is ideologically and theoretically correct, especially if it has a Marxist ideological line. Second, the correctness of the ideological line determines whether the party can effectively implement the party's political line and policies. If there is no ideological unity within the party, even if the political line is correct, it cannot be realized. Third, to overcome and correct wrong tendencies within the party, especially overall wrong tendencies, it is necessary to first rectify and improve the Marxist theoretical level of the entire party. During the period of the Great Revolution, Chen Duxiu exaggerated the strength of the counter-revolutionaries and abandoned the leadership of the proletariat. His right-wing opportunism led to the failure of the Great Revolution. The "left" deviationist error during the period of the Agrarian Revolution, blindly copying the experience of the Russian Revolution without studying China's national conditions and the actual situation of the Chinese Revolution, violated the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, and also resulted in serious setbacks for the party and the revolution. Mao Zedong adhered to the principle of seeking truth from facts, integrating the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific realities of the Chinese Revolution, and found a correct revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power by force. After the end of the Zunyi Conference, which rectified the leaders' "left" deviationist errors within the party central committee, the leadership of the Chinese Revolution continuously led to victory. Historical facts have proven that deviation from or departure from the Marxist-Leninist ideological line will inevitably lead to errors in the political line. Therefore, the success or failure of the ideological construction of the party is directly related to the success or failure of the political construction of the party. 
The ideological construction of the party is the ideological foundation of the organizational construction of the party. In the organizational construction of the party, whether the democratic centralism can be implemented and the unity and cohesion of the party can be maintained, making the party a strong core for leading the Chinese Revolution and construction, is closely related to the ideological construction of the party. The unity and cohesion of the party are the life of the party and one of the basic requirements to be achieved in party-building. So, how can the party organization become a united and cohesive whole? Fundamentally speaking, only when every party member shares the same belief and ideal can there be ideological unity throughout the party, leading to unity in organization and politics. Lenin once pointed out that organizational unity without ideological unity is meaningless. We have never sought this kind of organizational unity, nor can we seek it.
Because of the ideological differences, people appear to be close yet distant from each other, and organizational unity is also impossible. The Communist Party of China has become a strong fortress leading the revolution by each party member having the common belief and communist ideals. Mao Zedong emphasized throughout the revolutionary practice that the entire party should study Marxism-Leninism seriously, first achieving ideological unity, and then achieving political and organizational unity. In the process of the party's self-organization, ideological construction has always been the foundation. Ideological construction is the ideological guarantee for strengthening the party's style. Party style refers to the style of party organizations and members in politics, ideology, organization, work, and life, and it is a concrete embodiment of the nature of the vanguard of the working class. Human behavior comes from human thoughts, and thoughts determine a person's words and actions. To maintain and carry forward the party's fine traditions and style, we must continuously strengthen the ideological education of party members, enhance their party consciousness, and establish a communist world outlook and worldview. In the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Mao Zedong demanded that party members study Marxist-Leninist theory seriously, compare their words and actions, rectify the "three styles" - party style, academic style, and literary style. After the Yan'an Rectification Movement, not only did the party's level of Marxist-Leninist theory improve, but our party's fine style was also formed. People who still have non-proletarian thoughts in their minds often make mistakes of subjectivism, sectarianism, bureaucracy, and individualism in their work because non-proletarian thoughts are the root cause of these mistakes. If the root is not eradicated, mistakes will inevitably be made in work. The way and means to eradicate non-proletarian thoughts is to carry out Marxist-Leninist ideological and theoretical education. The style of our party is to seek truth from facts, start from reality, connect theory with practice; believe in the masses, rely on the masses, "come from the masses, go to the masses", closely connect with the masses and take the path of serving the masses; be courageous in criticism and self-criticism, adhere to the truth, correct errors, distinguish right from wrong, and unite comrades; dare to take responsibility, regardless of personal gain or loss; work hard, be selfless in serving the public; be frugal, thrifty and economical; be neither arrogant nor impatient, nor discouraged. To strengthen the construction of party style, we must first pay attention to ideological education, solve ideological problems, and make party ideological education continuous and institutionalized. Therefore, providing correct ideological education for party members is the foundation for correcting their style.
II. The main content of ideological construction
To strengthen the ideological construction of the party, it is necessary to clarify what the content of ideological construction is. The main content of the party's ideological construction is based on the proletarian world outlook and methodology, guided by Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism, arming the entire party with advanced revolutionary theories, educating the majority of party members to improve their consciousness, correct their thoughts, transform their worldviews, and truly join the party not only organizationally but also ideologically.
"Arming the entire party with Marxist-Leninist theories is the fundamental task of the party's ideological construction"
Mao Zedong believed that arming the entire party with Marxist-Leninist theories is the fundamental task of the party's ideological construction. Marxism-Leninism is the soul, driving force, and direction of the Communist Party. This is a general law of the development of proletarian parties in various countries worldwide. The Communist Party of China is no exception. However, our party has its own particularity, which is mentioned above, it developed and grew in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with a very large petty-bourgeoisie element. Because of the deep influence of feudal and petty-bourgeoisie ideology, and because "our preparation in thought and theoretical cultivation was insufficient" when the party was founded, there is a very prominent contradiction between proletarian thought and non-proletarian thought within our party. Therefore, it is even more necessary to emphasize the constant use of Marxist-Leninist ideological education to educate our members.
Mao Zedong pointed out: "Generally speaking, all Communist Party members with considerable research ability should study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, study the history of our nation, and study the current situation and trends of the movement. Through their education, they should make it clearer to those party members with lower cultural levels." Liu Shaoqi further emphasized: "The most important issue in the construction of our party is first and foremost the issue of ideological construction, which is to educate and transform our party members with the scientific ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian class... The greatest contribution Mao Zedong has made to our party and the Chinese people is that he completed the great task of Sinicizing Marxism and that he created the great Mao Zedong Thought as represented by him. The new Party Charter stipulates: 'The Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as its action guidelines.' This requires the entire party to arm its minds with Marxism-Leninism, to educate party members and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and to use it to guide their own practices. Overcoming non-proletarian thinking with proletarian thinking is the key to ideological construction."
The key to instilling communist ideology throughout the party and transforming and overcoming various non-proletarian thinking within the party with the worldview of Marxism-Leninism is to require every party member to not only join the party organizationally, but also join the party ideologically. As early as the struggle period in Jinggangshan, Mao Zedong realized the seriousness of this problem. Due to the ongoing deepening of the land revolution war, the issue of ideological education has increasingly become an urgent matter on the party's agenda. Zhou Enlai, who was then the Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the CPC, also pointed out: "To make the Party Bolshevik, the first thing to do is to strengthen the foundation of the proletariat. At the same time, we must continue to transform the party's organization, especially resolutely oppose the consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie." In the Communist Party of China, the contradiction between proletarian thinking and petty bourgeois thinking is the main contradiction, the essential contradiction. Therefore, the main problem to be solved in ideological construction is this problem. In 1929, Mao Zedong made a clear exposition of the various manifestations, harms, and root causes of non-proletarian thinking within the party, as well as the methods for correction, at the Gutian Conference, laying the theoretical foundation for the ideological construction of the Communist Party of China. He believed that "within the Communist Party of the Fourth Army of the Red Army, various non-proletarian thoughts exist, which greatly hinder the implementation of the party's correct line." "The most urgent problem in the Red Army's party is education." The various manifestations listed by him, such as pure military viewpoints, extreme democratization, non-organizational concepts, absolute egalitarianism, subjectivism, individualism, as well as remnants of banditry and blind action, are mostly specific manifestations of petty bourgeois thinking within the party. Petty bourgeois thinking is concentrated in three aspects: in terms of thinking methods, its characteristics are subjective and one-sided observation of issues, treating desires as reality, feelings as policies, and the part as the whole. Petty bourgeois intellectuals who are detached from the production process often satisfy themselves with book knowledge, lack of sensory knowledge, and their thinking methods tend to manifest as dogmatism. Petty bourgeois individuals associated with the production process have a certain amount of sensory knowledge, but due to the limitations of small-scale production such as narrowness, looseness, isolation, and conservatism, their thinking methods tend to manifest as empiricism. In terms of political issues, a considerable majority of the petty bourgeois are wavering. They forget everything when things are going well or when there is victory, and they become pessimistic, disappointed, or even disengage from revolution or defect from the party when facing setbacks or failures. Among them, there are quite a few people who, although they have endured years of hard struggle and have been tempered, have not learned much or well in terms of Marxism-Leninism and still possess a lot of negative elements in terms of ideological spirit.Many of their representatives hope for the revolution to succeed immediately in order to change the situation of their class. As a result, they lack patience for the long and arduous nature of the revolution, while showing great interest in "left-wing" revolutionary phrases and slogans. The numerous "left" leaning errors they made were directly related to these issues. On the other hand, some individuals are most attracted to the various allurements of the bourgeoisie, which manifests politically as a right-wing sentiment and right-wing viewpoints that follow behind the bourgeoisie. Generally speaking, during the split between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the party is more prone to making "left" leaning errors. Conversely, during the union of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the party is more prone to making right-leaning errors.
In terms of organizational life, due to the limitations of the general petit bourgeoisie's lifestyle and thought methods, especially influenced by China's backward and scattered feudal clan and guild system, the petit bourgeoisie's organizational problems tend to manifest as individualism and sectarianism. These tendencies are more likely to arise during long-term guerrilla warfare in rural areas. Those with these erroneous ideas do not dedicate themselves to the cause of the party and the people, but rather utilize the power of the party and the people, even at the expense of damaging the interests of the party and the people, to achieve their personal and sectarian goals. They often destroy the flesh-and-blood connection between the party and the masses and the close unity within the party by resorting to bureaucratism, patriarchalism, punitive practices, individual heroism, anarchism, liberalism, sectarianism, pursuing independence, factional disputes, and even employing thuggish tactics. In view of these negative manifestations of petit bourgeois thinking, Mao Zedong emphasizes that party members should study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, study our nation's history, and study the current situation and trends of the movement in order to promote our scientific understanding of the world and our understanding of the relationships between individuals and the masses, individuals and collectives, individuals and organizations, and individuals and the party. We must ensure that our ideological, political, and organizational lines are on the correct path of Marxism-Leninism, eliminating all kinds of interference from the "left" or the right; everything must start from reality, everything must be for the benefit of the people, and everything must be in service of the party's political tasks and struggling goals. We must overcome the dogmatic approach to Marxism-Leninism, blindly copying foreign experiences, detaching ourselves from the reality of China, and elevating ourselves above the masses. Therefore, it is an urgent and important problem that requires dedicated efforts to thoroughly and extensively study the theory of Marxism-Leninism.① We must treat the study of Marxist-Leninist theory as a regular activity of the party. We must establish and improve specialized ideological and political work institutions, integrating mass self-education and transformation with specialized ideological and political work. Only in this way can we continuously raise the ideological consciousness and theoretical level of all party members and transform the party into a vanguard of the proletariat that is guided by the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, composed of highly conscious, disciplined, and self-sacrificing members, and capable of representing the interests of the broad masses of the people and uniting them in advancing together. Actively and correctly engaging in internal party struggle is an important method for building the party ideologically, as well as the fundamental method for resolving internal party contradictions. Mao Zedong mentioned in the resolution on "Borderland Party" that, "In the party's transformation, we must completely adopt the standpoint of the proletariat... and resolutely struggle against the past tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie in the party towards freedom, independence, romanticism, and ideological vacillation." Internal criticism strengthens the party organization and enhances its fighting capacity." In order for criticism to play its role as a weapon in battle, Mao Zedong advocated as early as the period of the land revolution that criticism must aim to make party members understand that its purpose is to enhance the party's fighting capacity in order to achieve victory in class struggle.
Criticism should not be used as a tool to attack others. Criticism should distinguish between those within the party and those outside the party. Criticism should focus on major aspects, prevent subjective arbitrariness and vulgarity, and conversations should be supported by evidence. Criticism should also pay attention to political factors. During the period of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to resolve the ideological issues among party members and improve their quality, Mao Zedong developed criticism and self-criticism as part of the rectification movement for Marxist ideological education. This brought new content to the theory of Marxist criticism and was a great initiative in the history of the Communist Party. In the rectification movement, Mao Zedong created a set of policies and methods to properly address the contradictions between correct and erroneous thoughts, and advanced and backward thoughts within the party.
First, theory should be combined with practice.
During the rectification movement, Mao Zedong called on all party members and cadres to seriously study the theory of Marxism, grasp its essence, and at the same time guide them to connect their personal thoughts and work with the reality of the Chinese revolution and present situation. They should apply the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, learn while rectifying, and engage in self-reflection. This approach allowed cadres to better understand the correct and incorrect paths in the party's history from their personal practical experiences and gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical essence of Marxism. It also effectively overcame the existing subjectivist learning style within the party, liberating many comrades from the darkness of dogmatism. In order to combat subjectivism and the detachment of theory from practice, it is necessary to promote the spirit of Marxism of seeking truth from facts. As stated in the article "Transforming Our Learning," "seeking truth from facts" is the sharpest and most effective weapon in the hands of Communist Party members, and Communists "eat by seeking truth from facts". Through the rectification movement in Yan'an, the spirit of combining theory with practice and seeking truth from facts became the prevailing trend, and a new atmosphere for learning emerged within the party.
Second, criticism should be combined with self-criticism.
The fundamental purpose of carrying out the rectification movement is to "adhere to the truth and correct mistakes" and "both clarify thinking and unite comrades," in order to improve the party's level of Marxist-Leninist theory and ideological and policy thinking. Whether the rectification movement can achieve the desired results depends on the conscious understanding of truth and the correction of mistakes by party members, which is stimulated through the study of the rectification documents and the study of theory in connection with practice. It requires party members to engage in criticism and self-criticism seriously, seriously and not perfunctorily, in order to promote ideological transformation and raise the level of consciousness. It is precisely because of this that the basic method adopted throughout the Yan'an rectification movement was criticism and self-criticism as the main form of self-education.
In order to carry out criticism and self-criticism in a healthy manner, Mao Zedong deeply summarized the historical lessons and experiences of internal struggles within the party. In response to the erroneous guideline of "mercilessly attacking and ruthlessly striking" pursued by the "Left" sectarianism, he put forward the two principles of "punishing mistakes to better education and curing illness to save people" that must be adhered to during the rectification movement. The Party Central Committee repeatedly emphasized that criticism and self-criticism must be based on facts, present evidence, reason with others, and use correct thoughts to overcome erroneous thoughts, so that people can accept and embrace them, and allow every comrade to truly understand right from wrong based on reason and achieve genuine consensus in understanding. For some comrades, including their own mistakes, if they cannot understand certain issues for a period of time, they should wait, and repeat opinions are allowed, while opposing the use of oppressive methods. It is even more unacceptable to treat internal issues as contradictions between enemies.Regarding the handling of people, a cautious attitude is taken, neither being vague nor harming comrades.During the rectification movement in Yan'an, leading cadres set an example by engaging in sincere criticism and self-criticism, playing a leading role, dispelling the concerns of ordinary cadres, and promoting a good atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism. This has become the basic method for the whole Party to resolve ideological contradictions within the Party and correctly handle internal contradictions among the people.
Third, the combination of leadership and the masses.
The development of the rectification movement in Yan'an fully embodies the process of combining leadership and the masses. In May 1941, the rectification study was first carried out among senior cadres of the Central Party Committee, criticizing subjectivism and summarizing the Party's historical experience. Based on a basic consensus in ideological understanding, it was further promoted throughout the Party in February 1942, conducting a Marxist educational campaign, achieving unprecedented unity within the Party. In October 1943, it returned to the study of rectification among senior cadres of the Party Central Committee, clarifying the political line from a political perspective, summarizing experiences, and continuing until April 1945 when the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee passed the Resolution on Several Historical Issues, achieving unity among the whole Party, especially among senior Party cadres based on Marxism-Leninism. This educational principle and method of learning from both the leadership and the masses has been applied to other Party work, which is the method of combining leadership and the masses. Mao Zedong summarized and advocated this method. On June 1, 1943, Mao Zedong summarized the experience since the rectification movement and drafted the Decision on Several Issues in Leadership Methods for the Central Committee, which made theoretical generalizations on the scientific methods of implementing Party leadership and explicitly put forward the principle of "combining leadership and the masses". Mao Zedong believed that to accomplish a task, it is necessary to both unleash the enthusiasm of leading cadres and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.
"In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." The method and work method of combining leadership with the masses not only embodies the ideology of democratic centralism but also embodies the spirit of the mass line, with extremely rich content. Of course, the formation and application of this method did not start with the rectification movement, but its promotion and advocacy have become an effective method and tradition of the whole Party, which is one of the results of the rectification movement.
The rectification movement is a great initiative in the ideological construction of the Communist Party of China. It provides experience, sets an example, and establishes several fundamental principles (which later Mao Zedong elevated to the Three Major Styles of the Party) for how to construct the Party ideologically, giving a clear path for the ideological construction of the Party and producing a large number of outstanding cadres for the Chinese revolution.
Under the new historical conditions of the Liberation War, a movement of "Three Inquiries" (inquiry into class, ideology, and style) and "Three Rectifications" (rectification of organizations, ideology, and style) was launched as the basic content of the Party's rectification and consolidation.
The historical experience of the Communist Party of China has proven that using the rectification method to solve internal contradictions, correct the Party's line, transform the Party's style, enhance Party unity, consolidate Party organization, and strengthen Party leadership is highly effective. It is a great tool for the ideological construction of the Communist Party of China, an important way for Mao Zedong to establish the Party ideologically, and a development of Marxist party-building theory by Mao Zedong.
III.Adhering to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts is the fundamental way to strengthen the Party's ideological construction.
Strengthening the Party's ideological line and adhering to arming the entire Party with Marxist theory are fundamentally about adhering to the Party's pragmatic and realistic ideological line. The pragmatic and realistic ideological line established by the Communist Party of China (CPC) applies dialectical materialism, namely the worldview and epistemology of Marxism-Leninism, to solving practical problems in the Chinese revolutionary context. It has been continuously improved through the CPC's struggle against various erroneous thoughts and the accumulation of experience and lessons. This ideological line has been proven to be completely correct through the long-term practice and struggle of the Party, and it possesses rigorous scientificity and unparalleled combat effectiveness. It is the lifeline of the CPC.
The spirit of pragmatism as the Party's ideological line emerged during the period of the Great Revolution. Mao Zedong's analysis of the various classes in Chinese society and his discussion of the peasant question and the path of the Chinese revolution in his articles "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" embody the spirit of pragmatism.
The pragmatic ideological line gradually became clear during the period of the Land Revolution War. In 1929, Mao Zedong regarded subjectivism and Marxism as opposites, considering subjectivism as an erroneous guiding principle. He called on Party members to replace subjectivism with the method of investigation and research. In May 1930, Mao Zedong wrote the article "Oppose Dogmatism" in which he used the concept of "ideological line" for the first time, explicitly putting forward the principle of integrating theory with practice. He pointed out, "The 'dogma' of Marxism should be studied, but it must be combined with our actual conditions. We need 'dogma', but we must correct dogmatism that is divorced from actual conditions." To integrate the universal principles of Marxism with the Chinese reality, it is necessary to go to the masses to conduct investigations and research. "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." During this period, although the scientific concept of pragmatism had not yet emerged, Mao Zedong had already put forth the basic principles of the pragmatic ideological line - the integration of theory with practice. This laid the foundation for the formation of the ideological line.
The formation of the pragmatic ideological line was formalized during the Yan'an Rectification Movement. During this period, Mao Zedong wrote works such as "Rectify Our Study" and "Rectify the Party's Style", in which he explicitly put forward the concept of pragmatism and provided a scientific definition of its meaning. He elaborated on the ideological essence of starting from reality, pragmatism, and the unity of theory and practice.
The formation of the pragmatic ideological line has its theoretical basis and historical conditions:Firstly, it is the inevitable result of the development of the CPC's philosophical thought. "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" (referred to as the "Two Essays") provide philosophical arguments for the Party's ideological line. First of all, the "Two Essays" summarize the combination of the universal principles of Marxism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution from a philosophical perspective. "On Practice" is based on scientific social practice and elucidates the unified principles of subjectivity and objectivity, theory and practice in concrete historical terms, providing philosophical arguments for the pragmatic ideological line from an epistemological point of view. "On Contradiction" is based on the particularity of contradiction and elucidates the principles of the universality and particularity of contradiction and their dialectical unity. It provides philosophical arguments for the pragmatic ideological line from a dialectical perspective.
The viewpoints in "On Practice" regarding practice as the foundation of knowledge and the primacy of practice, and the viewpoints in "On Contradiction" regarding the particularity of contradiction as the foundation of knowledge and the importance of analyzing specific situations in a concrete manner, all serve to argue for the importance of starting from reality and seeking regularities of phenomena through "realistic matters".Because people's own practical activities, the actual and practical matters they face in their own practical activities are directly manifested as concrete and specific.
The ideas in "On Practice" about the two leaps in the process of cognition (from practice to knowledge, and then from knowledge to practice), and the ideas in "On Contradiction" about the basic order of the process of cognition (from particular to general, and then from general to particular) are all arguing for the following issue: to take the regular knowledge obtained from "actualities" as a guide for action, or in other words, to combine it with practice, serve practice, and test and develop it in practice.
The idea in "On Practice" about the general law of the development of knowledge, which is the cycle of "practice, knowledge, practice again, and knowledge again" to infinity, and the idea in "On Contradiction" about the cycle of cognition from particular to general, and then from general to particular to infinity, are also arguing for the following issue: seeking truth from facts is a process of gradual deepening and endlessness. That is to say, even the correct understanding that reflects the universality of contradictions, which has been proven by practice, must continue to return to practice, combine with new and concrete realities (practice), guide new practices, serve new practices, and continue to be tested and developed in the process. This process is endless.
"The two treatises" provide another important manifestation of philosophical argumentation for the Party's ideological line, which is that it summarizes the universal principles of Marxism and the specific lessons of China's revolutionary practice. "On Practice" deeply explores the epistemological roots of the historical errors of "left" and right-wing opportunism, especially "left" opportunist errors in the Chinese revolutionary history. "On Contradiction" digs deep into the epistemological and methodological roots of Wang Ming's dogmatism. In short, "The two treatises" provide the first philosophical argumentation for the Party's ideological line. It is on this basis that the Party's ideological line has further developed and improved.
Second, it is a product of the long-term opposition of the Communist Party of China to subjectivism. Subjectivism is a way of thinking that starts from subjectivity, exaggerates subjective power, and neglects objective reality. Subjectivism is extremely harmful. In the history of the Communist Party of China, every outbreak of subjectivism has caused serious setbacks or even failures to the revolutionary cause. Especially Wang Ming's "left" opportunist dogmatism, which ruled the party for the longest time, had the greatest harm and the worst influence, becoming the main ideological obstacle for the Communist Party of China to implement the correct line. In view of this profound historical lesson, Mao Zedong always placed the resolution to the problems of ideological methods and ideological lines prominently before the whole party in every historical period, especially at critical moments of revolutionary transformation. He regarded the struggle against subjectivism as a matter of prime importance. In the early 1940s, Mao Zedong conducted in-depth analysis and criticism of subjectivism based on his previous opposition to it, and initiated the Yan'an Rectification Movement, with the main content of opposing subjectivism. In 1942, Mao Zedong gave the slogan of "seek truth from facts" to the Central Party School in Yan'an. By 1945, he established the style of combining theory with practice as one of the three major styles of our party in the report of the 7th National Congress of the Party, which determined the ideological line of seeking truth from facts throughout the party. It can be seen that the formation of the Party's ideological line is closely related to the ideological struggle within the party. It is a highly summarized and summarized experience of the long-term struggle against subjectivism, especially Wang Ming's dogmatism. It embodies the struggles and explorations of the first generation of leaders and condenses their excellent ideological achievements.
The "seek truth from facts" ideological line expounded by Mao Zedong contains the following three theoretical contents:
First, start from reality. Mao Zedong creatively applied the philosophical line of materialism to practical work, proposing the viewpoint of starting from reality. The so-called reality refers to all objectively existing things, "everything except our minds is the objective reality... only our minds (thoughts) are the subject of study". Starting from reality means starting from the characteristics of moving objective things. Firstly, it is necessary to start from the specific characteristics of different things. For the practical activities of the proletarian party, the most important and fundamental thing is to start from the national conditions of one's own country. Understanding the nature of Chinese society and the national conditions of China is the fundamental basis for solving all revolutionary issues in China. The Chinese Communists recognized the nature of the old Chinese semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and based on this basic national condition, they found the special path of the Chinese revolution. Secondly, it is necessary to start from the constantly changing and developing objective situations. Thirdly, it is necessary to start from the totality and connection of things.
Secondly, theory must be linked to practice. Mao Zedong made a profound explanation of the theory being linked to practice, pointing out that "Chinese Communists can only be linked with theory by applying the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method, and by further making theoretical creations that meet China's needs through careful study of China's historical realities and revolutionary realities in all aspects." One must apply theory to practice. Mao Zedong particularly emphasized that the study of Marxist theory must pay attention to application. He said, "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it, apply it, and the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." He used the idiom "hitting the mark" to metaphorically illustrate the relationship between Marxist theory and the Chinese revolution, stating that "the arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot the Chinese revolution", and it is necessary to use the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method to solve China's practical problems. Practice must be guided by theory. Practice without theoretical guidance is blind practice, which is a principle of Marxism-Leninism repeatedly expounded by Mao Zedong. He pointed out that not only should one understand the conclusions of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin regarding general laws, but one should also learn their positions and methods for observing and solving problems. Not only should one study the general theory of Marxism, but one should also study China's history and current situation, extracting regularities from them and transforming Marxism into a Chinese national form.
Thirdly, it is necessary to exert conscious initiative and grasp objective laws. Firstly, it is necessary to conduct investigations and studies. Investigation and study are the prerequisites for understanding objective laws. Investigation and study are particularly important for Chinese Communists because the Chinese revolution has no ready-made experience to draw from. Only by conducting investigations and studies can one understand China's unique national conditions and find the special path of the Chinese revolution. Based on the experience of conducting extensive investigations and studies during the period of the land revolution war, Mao Zedong summarized two points on how to do investigations and studies well: one is to "look downward with one's eyes, not just look up at the sky. Without the interest and determination to look downward, one will never truly understand Chinese matters in one's entire life"; the other is to hold investigation meetings, not just have a superficial understanding or only listen to reports from a few grassroots leaders, but to squat down, hold various types of discussions among the masses, and conduct in-depth investigations and understanding. Mao Zedong emphasized the viewpoint of the masses in how to conduct good investigation meetings, saying, "Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downward, without the thirst for knowledge, without putting aside arrogance and being willing to be like a primary school student, one will definitely not be able to do it, and will definitely not do it well. It must be understood that the masses are the true heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Without understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge".Secondly, we need to identify the laws of things. The sensuous materials obtained through investigation are still unfinished products, and it is necessary to fully utilize the brain as a processing factory to find the internal connections of things and form concepts and laws. Mao Zedong summarized this production process as a process of refining the essence, distinguishing the true from the false, deriving conclusions from particular facts, and analyzing the surface to reveal the essence.
The ideological line of seeking truth from facts formed during the Yan'an Rectification Movement became the theoretical weapon for unifying the Party's ideological understanding, and promoted the unity of our Party under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
Section 3: Party Organization Construction
I. Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle of the proletarian party.
Party organization construction is an important content of Marxist party-building theory. Lenin pointed out: "The reason why the proletariat can and must become an invincible force is that the ideological unity formed based on Marxist principles is consolidated through the material unity of organization. This organization unites millions of laborers into a large army of the working class." Only through organization can the Party's correct theory, program, and line be transformed into a huge material force, and the role of the proletarian party's command center be maximized.
The proletarian party is the vanguard of the working class, the core leadership and command headquarters of the entire class. The nature and tasks of the party determine that it must adhere to democratic centralism as its organizational principle. This is because: as the leadership core of the entire class, the party must possess the leadership strength to seize power, build socialism, and achieve the great goal of communism. In this process, not only correct theory, program, and line are required, but also the consolidation and unity of its organization, maintaining ideological, political, and organizational unity and unified actions throughout the Party. Only by utilizing the organizational principle of democratic centralism can the enthusiasm of all members be maximally mobilized, and the will and actions of the entire Party be unified to achieve victory in the proletarian revolution.
The emergence and development of democratic centralism has gone through a relatively long historical process. Marx and Engels attached great importance to party organization construction in their struggle to establish the proletarian party. The documents they personally presided over, such as the "Statutes of the Communist League" and the "Drafts of the Statutes and Regulations of the International Working Men's Association Approved by the General Council in the Summer of 1872," are important texts that reflect the Marxist party doctrine and organizational principles. Although Marx and Engels did not use the concept of democratic centralism in these documents, the principle of unity between democracy and centralism is consistently present. From the perspective of Marx and Engels' thoughts and practices, the main contents of their party organizational principles include the following points: both the organization structure of the party and the Alliance and the International have a relatively complete organizational system that reflects the unity of democracy and centralism. At the first representative congress of the Communist League held in June 1847, the organization of the League, consisting of branches, local sections, central sections, central committees, and representative congresses, was established. The statutes of the League stipulate that the highest leading authority of the League is the central committee, which serves as the executive authority. The organizational system of the First International was more complete than that of the Communist League. The highest authority of the First International was the International Representative Congress.During the adjournment of the congress, the resolutions of the congress are implemented by the General Committee elected by the congress. The General Committee also has a core organization called the Standing Committee, which is composed of the chairman of the General Committee, the general secretary, and the secretaries of communication from each country. The organization of each country's association is called the Joint Committee. Below the Joint Committee, there are local groups, branches, and teams. From this, it can be seen that the international organizational structure is actually the prototype of the organizational structure of modern communist and workers' parties in various countries. 
Regarding the bottom-up electoral system, the First Congress of the Communist Alliance established the bottom-up electoral system. The draft constitution adopted by the First Congress stipulates that each branch elects its own leader and the leaders of each branch form the district committee, from which the leaders are selected. The Central Committee is elected by the district committee where the Central Committee is located. Public officials are elected regularly every year, and they can be replaced at any time if their work is unsatisfactory. The draft constitution also stipulates that every member of the International Workers' Association has the right to vote and be elected, and all elected leaders must report their work to their electors and can be replaced at any time. 
Regarding the organizational life of the party, members of the Communist Alliance (or international members) are equal within the organization. As Engels pointed out, there is only one type of member in the International, that is, members with equal rights and equal obligations, with no special members. The organizational life of the International always adheres to the democratic and centralizing principle of majority rule over minority. Marx is an exemplary follower of this principle. For example, at the Basel Congress, the Bakuninists requested a discussion on the issue of inheritance rights. Marx himself did not agree with Bakunin's view that the abolition of inheritance rights should be the starting point of social revolution, but the General Committee headed by Marx agreed to discuss this issue at the congress. Marx drafted a report on the issue of inheritance rights for the General Committee, which was submitted to the congress for discussion along with Bakunin's proposal. As a result of the discussion, neither proposal received a majority. In this situation, Marx did not use the authority of the General Committee to force everyone to accept his views, but acknowledged the status quo and actively worked to help people understand the issue through the practice of struggle. Regarding the principles of party activities, Marx always insisted on collective leadership in the General Committee. Marx was the practical leader of the International, with high prestige. However, in the General Committee, decisions were not made by Marx alone, but through collective discussions. Any proposal must be approved by a majority to be effective. When discussing issues in the General Committee, each member has full speaking rights and can freely express their opinions, but each person's speaking time is limited to five minutes. According to Marx's proposal, the chairperson of the weekly meetings of the General Committee is rotated. 
Regarding the relationship between leaders and the masses, Marx and Engels always treated this issue according to the principles of democratic equality, setting a glorious example for the organization building of the proletarian party.Marx and Engels are recognized leaders of the international communist movement and activists in socialist parties in various countries in Europe and America. People constantly seek their advice on revolutionary theory and strategy. However, they always treat others as equals, presenting suggestions and engaging in discussions as ordinary soldiers. They oppose others' worship of them and strictly prohibit any glorification of themselves. Marx once pointed out that he and Engels both considered their reputation to be worthless. "Because I detest all personal worship, when I was alive, I never allowed the publication of countless praises from various countries that disgusted me. I never even responded to them. Occasionally, I would respond, but only to criticize them. Engels and I originally set the necessary conditions when joining the secret communist group: to abandon all things in the constitution that encourage superstitious authority." Regarding the organizational discipline of the party, the "Constitution of the League of Communists" stipulates that all members must be politically consistent with the League, and their way of life and activities must align with the purpose of the League. They must not join any anti-communist (political or national) groups and must obey all decisions of the League. If these conditions are not adhered to, it is considered a "crime against the League," and depending on the severity, temporary suspension or expulsion from the League may be imposed. Marx believes that strict discipline is necessary to ensure the victory of the proletarian struggle. He stated, "We must now absolutely maintain the party's discipline, otherwise we will achieve nothing." 
At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, capitalism developed into imperialism, and the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat also entered a special stage of seizing political power. To adapt to the needs of this particular struggle, Lenin timely formulated specific organizational principles - centralism for the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.From 1899 to 1904, Lenin repeatedly emphasized the need to build the party based on the principle of centralism. In 1899, in the article "Our Immediate Tasks," he explicitly put forward the principle of centralism for the first time. Lenin believed that the new type of proletarian party established according to the principle of centralism had two main characteristics: first, local activities of the party must be completely free, while at the same time a unified and therefore centralized party must be established; second, the party should strive to be a revolutionary political party with the main goal of fighting for political freedom, while firmly abstaining from political conspiracies. The two characteristics proposed by Lenin have three significant implications: first, it is not only a profound summary of the historical experience of the international communist movement, but also a political remedy against the common tendency of small-group habits in the early establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party; second, it clearly puts forward the concept of centralism as a major characteristic of the new proletarian party, distinguishing it from other proletarian parties; third, it opposes the formation of conspiratorial organizations led by a minority, effectively distinguishing the centralism of the new proletarian party from various forms of centralized rules that have appeared in history, and unconsciously laying the theoretical foundation for future proposals of the principle of democratic centralism.
However, at that time, the biggest obstacle to implementing centralism was the economists. The economists believed that centralism violated the principle of democracy. In his book "What Is to Be Done?," Lenin pointed out that the necessary conditions for implementing the principle of democracy were complete openness, elections, and universal supervision. However, under the Tsarist autocracy, implementing such a democratic system was like farmers wielding wooden bats to fight against the secret agents, spies, and gendarmerie forces that possessed all the advanced equipment. More often than not, such actions would immediately lead to failure. Therefore, the party could only implement centralism. Moreover, Lenin made an unprecedented systematic exposition of the principle of centralism and further formulated specific implementation rules, developing the idea of centralism into a practical and relatively complete organizational system. In 1903, at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. This one-party, two-faction situation lasted for nearly a decade.
The struggle between the two factions over organizational issues far exceeds the struggle between the economic factions in terms of time, scale, and extent. The Mensheviks vigorously criticized the principle of centralism, claiming that it was a "bureaucratic" form of centralism and accused Lenin of wanting to turn the party into a "large factory" with the Central Committee acting as the factory manager, implementing a "serfdom" within the party, and transforming party members into "small wheels" and "small screws." They believed that the party should be the sum of various autonomous committees, and that the different parts of the party should not be subordinate to the whole, but should have autonomy over the whole. In response to the Mensheviks, Lenin published the famous book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" in 1904, which deeply criticized the absurd viewpoint of the Mensheviks on organizational issues and elaborated on the principles of centralism. In the book, Lenin repeatedly emphasized that the principle of centralism is the most fundamental and principled idea in the party-building plan of the Iskra newspaper. With centralism, the party's intellectual and moral authority will become authority derived from power. "The ideology of centralism is the method that, in principle, determines the resolution of all local and detailed organizational issues," and it is the only principled ideology. Furthermore, Lenin further proposed the principles of implementing centralism. He believed that in order to carry out the work of the party correctly, there needs to be a principle of majority rule, individuals must obey the organization, the lower levels must obey the higher levels, and the localities must obey the center. Without the principle of majority rule and the principle of parts obeying the whole, it is simply inconceivable. Lenin argued that the principle of centralism must be embodied in the party's organizational charter because "the charter is the formal expression of the organization." The party formulates a good charter as a fundamental organizational measure to ensure the implementation of the principle of centralism. The party can only strictly adhere to this charter in order to eliminate the self-will of small groups, arbitrary behavior of small groups, and meaningless disputes of small groups. Therefore, the principle of centralism "should run throughout the entire party charter." In this way, the ideology of centralism is transformed from theory into practice, transformed into the party's laws, transformed into the will of the whole party, and thereby transformed into a material weapon to destroy the system of despotic rule by the exploiting class.
II. The inheritance and development of the organizational principles of the proletariat by the Communist Party of China
Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle of our party and is a basic element of Mao Zedong's party-building theory. In the long period of revolutionary struggle, Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, continuously developed and perfected the principle of democratic centralism, greatly enriching and developing the theory of Marxist-Leninist democratic centralism.
Before the founding of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong discussed and researched with revolutionary intellectuals such as Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Cai Hesen, and Zhou Enlai about the question of what principles to establish the party upon. On August 13 and September 16, 1920, Cai Hesen wrote two long letters to Mao Zedong from Germany, introducing Lenin's theory of party-building and stating his basic views on the party's organizational issues. Regarding the organization principles of the party, Cai Hesen said: The organization of the Bolshevik Party is an extremely centralized organization, and the discipline of the party is an iron discipline. This must be the case in order to cultivate a small number of extremely conscious and organized individuals who can adapt to the era of war and undertake a huge transformation task. Cai Hesen also proposed that the highest organ of the party should be the Central Committee, and all activities and parts of the party, including newspapers, parliaments, groups, and various movements, should be absolutely under the command and supervision of the Central Committee. In his reply, Mao Zedong expressed: Your letter is very insightful, and I agree with every word. With their advocacy, our party was established in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism from the very beginning. The party's First Congress passed its manifesto, and the party constitutions of the Second, Third, and Fourth Congresses already embody the spirit of the principle of democratic centralism.
In June 1927, the Central Political Bureau, entrusted by the 5th Party Congress, stipulated in the second chapter "Party Building" of the Resolution on the Third Amendment to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, that "the guiding principle of the Party is democratic centralism", which was the first time that the principle of democratic centralism was clearly proposed and affirmed in the Party's constitution. In July 1928, the Party's 6th Congress adopted the Party Constitution, which initially elucidated the content of democratic centralism. In December 1929, in the resolution of the Gutian Conference drafted by Mao Zedong, he advocated combining ideological construction with the construction of democratic centralism in organization, and proposed to eliminate extreme democratization and correct non-organizational views, to carry out democratic life under the guidance of concentration, and for the minority to obey the majority. In 1937, China was facing a severe situation on the eve of the full-scale Japanese imperialist invasion. In order to mobilize millions of people to enter the united front against Japan and jointly defeat Japanese imperialism, Mao Zedong, in the conclusion of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in Yan'an in May 1937, not only raised democracy to the height of being a "guarantee for resistance against Japan", but also put forward that in order to achieve the goal of defeating Japanese imperialism, the Party must have strength. How can the Party have strength? Mao Zedong pointed out that in order for the Party to have strength, it relies on implementing the democratic centralism of the Party to mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole Party. During the period of reaction and civil war, centralism was more prominent. In the new era, centralism should be closely connected with democracy. By implementing democracy, the enthusiasm of the whole Party can be brought into full play. By bringing the enthusiasm of the whole Party into play, a large number of cadres can be trained, residual sectarian ideas can be eliminated, and the entire Party can be united like steel. 
In October 1938, the anti-Japanese war was on the eve of the transition from strategic defense to strategic stalemate. The Japanese aggressors turned their main force to the rear battlefield, and the Kuomintang adopted an extremely passive policy in the war. The Communist Party of China had a rightist error led by Wang Ming, abandoning Party leadership. At the same time, "since our country is a small production family-based country and has not yet had democratic life nationwide, this situation is reflected within our party, resulting in insufficient democratic life. This phenomenon hinders the full play of the Party's enthusiasm". In response to this situation, Mao Zedong, in the political report of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, made clear demands on how to rely on democratic centralism to mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole Party in the anti-Japanese war. He said, "The Communist Party of China, which is in front of a great struggle, requires the leadership organs of the whole Party, all Party members and cadres to fully exert their enthusiasm in order to achieve victory. The so-called exertion of enthusiasm must be manifested concretely in the creative ability, responsible spirit, active work, daring and ability to raise questions, express opinions, and criticize shortcomings, as well as the supervisory role based on the perspective of cherishing of leadership organs and leading cadres. Without these, so-called enthusiasm is empty. And the exertion of this enthusiasm depends on the democratization of Party life. Without democratic life within the Party, the purpose of exerting enthusiasm cannot be achieved. The creation of a large number of capable talents is only possible in democratic life." In order to enhance the Party's fighting capacity and break through the difficulties of war, Mao Zedong also emphasized in this political report, "Expanding internal Party democracy should be regarded as a necessary step to consolidate the Party and develop the Party. It is an important weapon to make the Party lively, active, capable and to grow new strength, and to overcome the war difficulties." He emphasized both the importance of expanding inner-Party democracy and the strict adherence to the discipline of "four obedience" by individuals to the organization, minorities to majorities, subordinates to superiors, and the whole Party to the center, in order to bring Party relations back on track and unify the Party's actions. In 1945, as the victory of the anti-Japanese war was approaching, the Party held the 7th Congress based on the rectification in Yan'an.
The 7th Congress of the Party raised the understanding and argumentation of democratic centralism to the level of organizational principles.In his report on amending the party constitution, Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "Our party is not simply the sum of a certain number of party members, but a unified organic body organized by all party members according to certain rules. It is the combination of party leaders and the led; it is the leader of the party, the various levels of party organizations, and the masses of party members coming together according to certain rules. This rule is the democratic centralism within the party."
The party constitution passed at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China defined democratic centralism as "centralism with democracy as its foundation, and democracy under centralized guidance." This was the first time that the dialectical relationship between democracy and centralism was accurately expressed in concise language. There are some criticisms of democracy under centralized guidance today, with some even considering it the theoretical basis for bureaucratic centralism. In fact, Liu Shaoqi explained its meaning clearly in his work "On the Party": democratic under centralized guidance means that all party meetings are convened by the party's leadership; party elections and resolutions must be thoroughly prepared, carefully considered, and follow certain procedures; all party members must be bound by the party constitution and unified discipline, and must obey the overall interests and firmly oppose extreme democratization and anarchic tendencies. All of this is precisely to promote democracy through normal procedures and channels. In practical work, some people understand democracy under centralized guidance as elections and voting according to the intentions of the party's leadership, thus weakening and undermining internal party democracy. This is indeed a serious problem that must be addressed in the party's life. However, it is a misunderstanding of democracy under centralized guidance and cannot be used to argue that democracy should be separated from centralized guidance.
After the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong's thoughts on democratic centralism underwent further development. During the War of Liberation, in September 1948, Mao Zedong summarized the experience of collective leadership and drafted the Central Committee's decision on "Improving Party Committee System," emphasizing that the party committee system is an important institution for ensuring collective leadership and preventing individual dictatorship. In March 1949, at the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee, Mao Zedong again emphasized the working methods of party committees. This further enriched and developed the thoughts on democratic centralism and made very favorable preparations for the arrival of a new stage of party building.
III. The basic content of party organizational construction
Party organizational construction is one of the main contents of party building and mainly includes tasks such as building the party cadre team, building the party member team, and building democratic centralism. Building the party cadre team occupies a central position in party organizational construction. Building the party member team is the foundation of party organizational construction. Building democratic centralism is an important task of party organizational construction. In the party's organizational construction, the party organization exerts its influence and power through the party cadre team. Party cadres are the backbone of the party organization, the main implementers of the party's line, principles, and policies, and the decisive force in implementing party leadership.
(1) "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor."
The Communist Party of China has always believed that the importance of the cadre issue lies, first and foremost, in the need for a large number of cadres to organize and lead the great revolutionary struggle...
The Communist Party of China is a party that leads the great revolutionary struggle in a nation of hundreds of millions of people. Without leaders who possess both moral qualities and talent, the party cannot fulfill its historical mission. The correct political line depends on the correct organizational line to ensure it. Cadres at all levels of the party are the strategists and organizers of the revolutionary cause. They shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing the party's lines, principles, and policies, organizing and leading the masses to realize the basic lines of the party in various historical stages. Only by playing the role of "leaders" among the masses can the party's general line and policies be transformed into the conscious actions of hundreds of millions of people, and the party's cause can achieve victory. Mao Zedong believed that as the guarantee of the party's victories in all undertakings, cadres are not only essential for the party's general line and overall tasks, but also for specific work and tasks in certain regions and units. In response to situations where work is stagnant, progress is slow, and there are widespread public opinions in some places and units, Mao Zedong pointed out that "a fundamental reason why work cannot progress in many places and many agencies is the lack of a united, well-connected leadership core that can establish normal and sound relations with the masses. If a school of a hundred people does not have a leadership core of several or even a dozen of the most active, honest, and sensitive individuals formed from teachers, staff, and students according to actual conditions (not forcibly gathered), then the school will not be able to do well."
Cadres are the bridge between the party and the masses. The party is the faithful representative of the interests of hundreds of millions of people, the fighting force that wholeheartedly seeks the interests of the people. The party's cause is the cause of the people, and the guidelines and policies formulated by the party must be implemented by relying on the people. However, in order for the masses to sincerely follow the party, unite around the party, and engage in various undertakings under the party's leadership, an important link is to rely on our cadres to carry out propaganda, mobilization, and organization work among the masses. Without the work of a large number of cadres who closely connect with the masses, the party cannot survive. When establishing the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Base Area, Mao Zedong emphasized that cadres should "organize, train, and send the masses to the battlefield of economic construction. They are the commanders on the economic front, while the masses are the soldiers." Later, Mao Zedong listed close ties with the masses as one of the three major styles of the party. The party maintains contact with the masses through cadres at all levels and strengthens its leadership over the masses, thereby accomplishing various tasks. In this way, the party will not be separated from the masses, and its cause will be invincible.
(2) The cadre policy of appointing people based on their abilities and the standards of employing people who possess both moral qualities and talent. "In the history of our nation, there have always been two opposing lines regarding the use of cadres: one is the 'appointing people based on their abilities' line, and the other is the 'appointing people based on personal connections' line. The former is a righteous line, while the latter is an unrighteous line." The proletarian selflessness of the Communist Party determines that its cadre policy is to appoint people based on their abilities. When criticizing Zhang Guozhen's practice of appointing people based on personal connections, Mao Zedong emphasized the need to "adhere to a righteous and fair style in cadre matters, in order to consolidate the unity of the party, which is the important responsibility of the central and senior leadership." Mao Zedong insisted on selecting talent from all walks of life and opposed sectarianism and cliques. He once said, "I refuse all requests for job arrangements. I don't introduce, recommend, speak, or write letters. These 'four nos' are the basis for opposing appointing people based on personal connections."
Adhering to the cadre policy of appointing officials based on their abilities means adhering to the standard of having both moral integrity and talent. The Communist Party of China, based on the Marxist cadre policy and drawing on the standards of ancient Chinese politicians, creatively put forward the specific contents of the Party's cadre requirements in terms of moral integrity and talent. This includes "understanding Marxism-Leninism, having political vision, possessing work capability, being willing to make sacrifices, being able to independently solve problems, not wavering in the face of difficulties, and working faithfully for the nation, class, and Party." Mao Zedong summarized the standard of moral integrity and talent as "firmly implementing the Party's line, obeying Party discipline, closely connecting with the masses, having independent work capabilities, being proactive and capable, and not seeking personal gain."
Once the standard of having both moral integrity and talent for cadres is established, how to identify and select talents for leadership positions at all levels becomes a crucial issue. Mao Zedong believed that, in order to assess and identify cadres, one must first broaden their horizons and improve their thinking methods. Some comrades also agree with selecting cadres with both moral integrity and talent, but they find it difficult to find talented individuals. This is a problem of thinking methods and limited vision. During the period of the land revolution and war, in response to the situation where some people often lamented the lack of cadres, Mao Zedong sharply pointed out, "Are there really no cadres? Countless cadres have emerged from the struggles for land, economic battles, and revolutionary wars. How can it be said that there are no cadres? Discard the wrong viewpoint, and cadres will be right in front of you." Furthermore, Mao Zedong emphasized the main method of identifying cadres, which is to "not only look at a cadre's current actions, but also consider their entire history and all their work." This can avoid mistakes in personnel selection. In addition, Mao Zedong emphasized the need to assess and identify cadres, select and train successors in the practical struggles of revolution and mass movements. "To truly unite and connect with the masses, the core leaders must gradually emerge from the struggles of the masses, and cannot be formed by separating from the struggles of the masses." "It is necessary to continuously promote active individuals who have emerged from the struggle, to replace the mediocre or corrupted individuals among the core leaders."
(3) Cadre training and cadre education.
The proletarian revolutionary cause requires thousands of excellent cadres. In order to ensure a succession of the revolutionary cause, the Communist Party of China pays great attention to the training and education of cadres. Firstly, they must "guide them." Mao Zedong believed that cadres should be given responsibilities and allowed to work, enabling them to enhance their capabilities through practice, and at the same time, providing guidance at appropriate times. Leadership experience can only be gained after assuming leadership positions and can never be achieved before that. "To become a truly capable senior commander, it cannot be achieved by someone who is inexperienced or only talks about warfare on paper. It can only be achieved through learning in war." In war, "it is often not about learning first and then doing, but doing and learning at the same time, doing is learning." Only by doing so can one become a mature leader and make significant contributions to the Party's cause.
Secondly, to "improve them," "this means giving them opportunities to learn, educating them, and helping them improve both theoretically and in their work capabilities." The most important aspect of improving the qualities of cadres is to enhance their level of Marxist theory. Mao Zedong said, "Our vision is not enough, we should rely on binoculars and microscopes. The method of Marxism is the political and military telescope and microscope." However, studying theory is not just about memorizing some aphorisms and conclusions of revolutionary mentors. Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the method of studying theory in connection with practice, pointing out that "the great power of Marxism-Leninism lies in its connection to the specific revolutionary practice of each country. For the Communist Party of China, it means learning to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of the Chinese revolution." "Talking about Marxism without considering Chinese characteristics is nothing but abstract and empty Marxism." Mao Zedong also summarized the guidelines of theoretical study and research as "establishing the study and research centered on studying practical problems of the Chinese revolution, guided by the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism," further indicating the direction of theoretical study for cadres.
Lastly, we should cherish them. The methods of cherishing cadres include "reviewing their work, helping them summarize their experiences, promoting their achievements, and correcting their mistakes." This can make them make fewer or no mistakes. "To entrust without inspection and only pay attention when serious mistakes are made is not a way to cherish cadres." Secondly, it is necessary to treat cadre who make mistakes correctly, "for cadres who make mistakes, generally speaking, persuasion should be used to help them correct their mistakes." Thirdly, "taking care of their difficulties," "if cadres have problems such as illness, life, and family, they must be cared for to the best of our ability." Cultivating new cadres, especially cultivating young new cadres, is of strategic significance. Some Communists are not enthusiastic about selecting new cadres, especially young cadres because they do not trust them and are afraid that they won't be able to handle the situation or steer the ship steadily. This is political shortsightedness. Mao Zedong believes that the Chinese revolution and construction undertaking always need young people to take over, emphasizing that "if our party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." He also requires the entire party to consider the planned cultivation of a large number of new cadres as our battle task.
(4) Correctly treating cadres who make mistakes.
In the practice of transforming society and the world, it is inevitable that cadres will make various mistakes, and there is no one who does not make mistakes. The Chinese Communist Party has a series of correct guidelines, policies, and theoretical ideas on how to correctly treat cadres who make mistakes.
First of all, it is important to focus on understanding the reasons for making mistakes, namely "focusing on the analysis of the current environment, the content of the mistakes at that time, the social roots, historical roots, and ideological roots of the mistakes at that time." Mao Zedong believed that if the specific reasons for the mistakes were not analyzed and there was too much emphasis on individual responsibility, it would not be conducive to uniting more people to work together and would be detrimental to the Party's cause. Secondly, there should be a correct guideline for dealing with cadres who make mistakes. In response to Wang Ming and other "left" opportunists who advocated a policy of "cruel struggle," "ruthless blows," and "killing with one blow" towards cadres who made mistakes, Mao Zedong emphasized, "When we expose errors and criticize shortcomings, our purpose is just like that of a doctor treating a disease, which is completely to save people, not to kill them." "In dealing with ideological and political maladies, we must never adopt a reckless attitude. We must adopt an attitude of 'treating the sickness to save the patient,' which is the correct and effective method." Therefore, Mao Zedong further concretized this guideline of "unity-criticism-unity," which means starting from the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle, and then achieving new unity on a new basis. It is precisely because the Communist Party of China has adhered to this correct guideline that it has tightly united a large number of cadres under the Party's banner and achieved one great victory after another. Finally, cadres who make mistakes should also have a correct attitude towards their own mistakes, as any shortcomings and mistakes will harm the Party and the cause of the people. This requires cadres at all levels of the Party to adopt a serious attitude in the face of mistakes, humbly accept criticism and help from others, seriously summarize their experiences and lessons, and do better in their future work. Mao Zedong has always advocated allowing others to make mistakes and allowing them to correct their mistakes. However, he opposes concealing and clinging to mistakes, as this is not only "harmful to the collective, but also harmful to the individual." Democratic centralism construction: Democratic centralism construction is an important task of Party organization construction. Only by implementing democratic centralism can a complete and tightly-knit organizational system of the Party be established, forming a unified whole with all Party members and various Party organizations. Only then can the relationships between Party leaders and the led, between higher-level Party organizations and lower-level ones, and between individual Party members and Party organizations be properly handled, the normalcy of intra-Party political life be achieved, and the enthusiasm of the entire Party be brought into play. Only then can a scientific leadership system and working system be established and correct lines, principles, and policies be formulated and implemented, thus realizing the Party's correct leadership.
Regarding the basic connotations of democratic centralism, the Party believes that democratic centralism is a combination of democracy on the basis of centralism and democratic guidance. It is the application of Marxist epistemology and the mass line in the Party's life and organizational construction. This summary reflects the essential characteristics of democratic centralism and clarifies the mutual relationship between democracy and centralism. As Mao Zedong said, "Democratic centralism, it is democratic and centralized, and it unifies two seemingly conflicting things, democracy and centralism, in a certain form." "Between democracy and centralism, there is not an impassable deep trench." The dialectical unity of democracy and centralism is manifested in the following ways: On the one hand, democracy is the foundation and premise of centralism. Without extensive democracy as a basis, correct opinions cannot be effectively gathered, and Party members and the masses will lack enthusiasm. Such centralism can only be empty and false. Only by combining democracy on the basis of sufficient democracy can there be correct and authoritative centralism. On the other hand, democracy is also constrained by centralism and carried out under centralized guidance. Centralism is a requirement of democracy itself. Only under centralized guidance can democracy have the correct direction, and Party organizations and the Party's enthusiasm and creativity can be better exerted. Without centralism, unified opinions cannot be formed, and nothing can be accomplished, and democracy cannot be realized.Therefore, when we emphasize the promotion of democracy, we must also pay attention to maintaining the centralization and unity of the party; when we emphasize centralization, we must also pay attention to democracy as the foundation. We cannot unilaterally emphasize democracy or unilaterally emphasize centralization. To adhere to the democratic centralism, we must oppose the two tendencies of personal dictatorship, patriarchalism, extreme democratization, and anarchism. We must overcome the problem of insufficient democracy and centralization.
After the principle of democratic centralism was written into the party constitution, our party's understanding of this principle has undergone a process of continuous development. From the history of party building after 1927, although we have used democratic centralism to guide party organizational activities, there have been exceptionally rich experiences and extremely profound lessons. In the relevant historical documents of the party, in the reports and works of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, etc., these experiences and lessons have been theoretically summarized and summarized, gradually forming some widely circulated basic views on this system within the party.
First, democracy and centralization must be promoted at the same time and not neglected on either side. This is the most basic view adopted by our party in implementing the principle of democratic centralism. The "Resolution on Party Organization during the Gutian Conference" proposed the principle of democratic life under the guidance of organizational centralization. In this way, democracy and centralization are organically unified, showing the dialectical relationship between the two sides. During the rectification period in Yan'an, through studying Marxist-Leninist party building theory and deepening the summary of historical experience, we realized that "democratic centralism means both democracy and centralization. Only with democracy below and no leadership above will lead to an anarchic state and nothing can be done well. Conversely, only with leadership above and no democracy below, there will be no way to expose shortcomings and improve work." Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi used two similar statements in their reports to the 7th Party Congress——"centralization on the basis of democracy, democracy under centralization" to summarize the content of democratic centralism and explain the dialectical relationship between democracy and centralization. At the same time, they also further pointed out that although in practice, due to differences in conditions, democracy and centralization can be emphasized to some extent, but neither can be neglected. Extreme democratization tendencies and bureaucratic centralism tendencies are both undesirable. Since then, during the period of the liberation war, the party successively improved the party committee system, established the system of application and report, and improved the working methods of the party committee. All of these were done under the guidance of the above-mentioned basic views.
Second, the "four forms of submission" are an important principle of democratic centralism, as well as our principle of discipline and expression of party character. In general, the "four forms of submission" are an important manifestation of the party's centralization, and "minority submits to the majority" is also an expression of the party's conference democracy. In October 1938, Mao Zedong summarized historical experience in his report to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, and explicitly summarized the party's discipline as: individuals submit to the organization, minorities submit to the majority, lower levels submit to higher levels, and the party submits to the central authority. At the same time, it was pointed out that these "four forms of submission" are also important principles of democratic centralism. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party accepted Mao Zedong's opinions and included them in the political resolution. In 1940, the Central Committee issued the "Decision on Strengthening Party Character", which regarded the "four forms of submission" as an important manifestation of party character, and called on the whole party to use it as a benchmark for inspection and correction of various violations of the "four forms of submission" in words and deeds. As a result, the view that "the 'four forms of submission' is not only the principle of democratic centralism but also the principle of discipline and expression of party character" was established throughout the party.Since the 7th Party Congress, subsequent party regulations have explicitly stipulated this.
Thirdly, more attention should be given to the construction of intra-party democracy. In 1929, when our party's strength was still like a "spark", Chen Duxiu seized on the fact that intra-party democracy was shrinking normally, attacking and even slandering the Central Committee as "completely cancelling the minimum degree of democracy". At this time, the Central Committee correctly responded: the limit of the party's democratization should be determined by objective and subjective conditions. If the objective white terror is extremely serious and demands exceed possible democratization, it is only a way to "help the Tsarist police" (as Lenin once said). With the significant improvement in the revolutionary situation and the fundamental change in objective conditions, Mao Zedong pointed out in the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in 1938: "Expanding intra-party democracy should be regarded as a necessary step to consolidate the party and develop the party, to make the party vibrant, competent, grow new forces, and an important weapon to break through the difficulties of war." By 1945, our party's views on promoting intra-party democracy as much as possible on the basis of conditions permitting had become more mature. At that time, Liu Shaoqi, based on the objective conditions in Yan'an and various liberated areas, pointed out in the report of the 7th Party Congress: "Now we must expand the democratic life within our party with a free hand, implement a high degree of intra-party democracy, and simultaneously implement a high degree of party leadership based on implementing a high degree of democracy."
Based on the above basic views, the party emphasizes that the following relationships must be handled well in implementing the principle of democratic centralism.
(1) The relationship between democracy and centralism.
The relationship between democracy and centralism in democratic centralism is a dialectical unity. They are two contradictory aspects of the same whole. They are contradictory yet unified. The contradiction between them is manifested in the following aspects: democracy emphasizes the full freedom of individual will expression (before centralism), while centralism emphasizes the constraint of individual will by the will of the majority consolidated by centralization, emphasizing the obedience of individual will. Their unity is manifested in the following aspects: democracy is the method, foundation, and process of centralism, while centralism is the destination and result of democracy, the embodiment and crystallization of the will of the majority. Correct centralism cannot be separated from democracy, and true democracy cannot be without centralism. Centralism without democracy is like a tree without roots, and democracy without centralism is like a flower without fruit. Both cannot truly achieve the unity of will and action.
Centralism without democracy is autocracy. Autocracy and arbitrariness, due to the lack of a democratic foundation and mass support, inevitably lead to everyone doing as they please and ultimately to anarchism in practice. On the other hand, democracy without centralism leads directly to extreme democratization and anarchism. It can be seen that centralism without democracy and democracy without centralism, both paths lead to anarchism in the end.
In the process of implementing democratic centralism, there has been a tendency to separate or even oppose the two, emphasizing one aspect while denying the other, each taking one side. In general, the masses, individuals, and members of the team emphasize democracy, while leaders, organizations, and secretaries emphasize centralization. Both are one-sided expressions. Some practice pragmatism in implementing the democratic centralism system, emphasizing democracy to superiors and centralization to subordinates. Some only pay attention to the formal unity of democracy and centralization, but separate the content of the two. They achieve democracy before centralization in form, where the masses practice democracy and the leaders practice centralization, the members practice democracy and the secretaries practice centralization. However, the will of centralization is not the will of the majority in the democratic process, but the personal will of the leaders. This form of democratic centralization violates the democratic centralism system and cannot truly achieve the unity of will.
(2) The relationship between individuals and organizations.
Party members should obey the organizational principles of the party, which is an important principle of party life. Party members are the elements that make up the organization, and the organization is the sum of party members, but not simply additive. Only when party members obey the party's organization can the unity of will and the consistency of actions be achieved. Only when each party member's will can be fully expressed, can their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity be fully utilized, can the organization have vitality, and can the unity of will and actions be truly achieved. Therefore, the obedience of party members to the organization should be based on democracy. Democratic decision-making and unified action accurately summarize the relationship between individual party members and the party organization. In dealing with the relationship between individuals and organizations, there are cases where some party members do not obey the organization's decisions and do not implement resolutions. There are also cases where some party members fail to fully express their own will and blindly obey. In party life, ordinary party members often take an extreme attitude of not obeying organizational decisions, while cadre party members often tend to see themselves as special members and refuse to implement or even change organizational resolutions without authorization, which is not allowed by organizational principles and discipline.
(3) The relationship between the minority and the majority.
The principle of the minority obeying the majority is the most basic principle of democratic centralism. Implementing the principle of democratic centralism requires fully implementing the principle of the minority obeying the majority to prevent authoritarian decision-making, power decision-making, and arbitrariness. However, because human understanding of truth is not linear but curved, truth is often first discovered by a minority. Therefore, the minority and the majority can be transformed into each other. Therefore, in implementing democratic centralism and dealing with the relationship between the minority and the majority, the correct principle is to obey the majority and respect the minority.
In party life and leadership work, violations of the principle of the minority obeying the majority often occur. Ordinary party members and a minority of members often occur when they do not obey the decisions made by the organization according to the will of the majority during the implementation of decisions. Party cadres and secretaries often occur when major issues are decided by personal preference, violating the principle of obeying the majority. To strictly implement the principle of the minority obeying the majority, it is very important to implement a voting system based on full democratic discussions for major issues.
(4) The relationship between subordinate organizations and superior organizations.
Subordinate organizations should obey superior organizations, which is an important organizational principle of the party. However, this obedience is not blind. Before making decisions regarding subordinate organizations, superior organizations should fully listen to the opinions of the subordinate organizations and strive to achieve consensus. During implementation, if subordinate organizations have different opinions, they should humbly listen and make adjustments to their work or ideological and political work. Therefore, the correct way to handle the relationship between the two is to obey the superior organization and respect the subordinate organization, so that the two can coordinate harmoniously. In party life and leadership work, situations arise where superior organizations do not respect subordinate organizations or where subordinate organizations do not obey superior organizations. Some superior organizations, before making decisions on major issues, neither investigate nor listen to the opinions of subordinate organizations. They exhibit subjectivism, bureaucracy, arrogance, and giving orders from a superior position. Such decisions are not based on reality and can generate resistance from subordinate organizations, making the resolutions unable to be implemented. Some subordinate organizations do not understand the overall requirements, and some even prioritize their own local interests. They adopt a pragmatic attitude towards the decisions of the superior organizations, implementing beneficial ones and refusing to execute those that are not favorable, using the excuse that they do not comply with reality, or arbitrarily changing the decisions of the superior organizations. These actions are all contrary to the organizational principles of the party.
(5) The relationship between all party organizations and the central authority.
All party organizations should obey the central authority, which is the most important principle in the basic principle of democratic centralism. In this relationship, the central authority respects the innovative spirit of all party organizations and pays attention to absorbing their opinions and suggestions. All organizations must strictly obey the central authority and, on the basis of seriously implementing the central authority's line, principles, policies, and decisions and resolutions, creatively implement them in conjunction with their own units, departments, and regional realities. In party life and leadership work, some party organizations, prioritizing their own local interests, refuse to implement the central authority's line, principles, policies, and decisions. Some even, under the pretense of acting based on reality and being creative in their implementation, boldly refuse to obey the central authority's decisions. This is not tolerated by the party's political discipline.
(6) The relationship between collective leadership and individual division of labor and responsibilities.
Collective leadership and individual division of labor and responsibilities are important systems of democratic centralism and also important leadership systems of the party. Both collective leadership and individual division of labor and responsibilities should not be neglected. The principle of collective leadership is the working system of the party committee.In the work of Party leadership, any major matter involving the Party's line, principles, and policies, major work arrangements, cadre appointments, transfers and dismissals, and major issues concerning the interests of the masses must be collectively discussed and decided by the Party committee, and must not be decided by individuals or a few individuals. In the implementation of decision-making and in the Party's daily work, the system of individual division of labor and responsibility must be enforced. Matters decided collectively must be implemented with corresponding responsibilities assigned to individuals, each should be held accountable for their respective tasks, and those who fail in their duties should be held responsible. Without collective leadership, it is not possible to ensure the scientific and authoritative nature of decision-making. In fact, without the constraints of the collective, personal arbitrary decision-making may be practiced, leading to the pursuit of personal interests in making decisions on major issues. Without the system of personal division of labor and responsibility, collective decisions may not be effectively implemented due to the lack of clear responsibilities. Mao Zedong made a concise summarization on collective leadership and the system of personal division of labor and responsibility, saying, "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regard it as the guide to action. Don't forget Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party.' The Party leads the people in everything; this is the fundamental principle of our Party and the fundamental guarantee of our socialist revolution and construction. Leadership by the Party, Party committees at all levels exercising leadership, and the principle that party members and cadres at all levels owe everything to the Party, must be strictly upheld. The Party must take firm control of all the work of the state. All organizations and individuals must submit to its leadership, must be subject to Party discipline, and must be under the supervision of the Party." This has important guiding significance to handle the relationship between Party committee collective leadership and the system of personal division of labor and responsibility well.
In managing the relationship between collective leadership and the system of personal responsibility, it is often difficult to distinguish between major issues and daily work, resulting in problems that should be decided collectively not being discussed collectively, which weakens collective leadership and affects the level of decision-making, resulting in decision-making mistakes. Conversely, issues that should not be submitted for collective discussion are submitted, leading to ineffective operation and low efficiency. Both of these situations should be avoided as much as possible.
The responsibilities of the Party committee collective leadership can be summarized according to the principles of scientific leadership as follows: establishing goals, formulating norms, authorizing personnel, inspecting and supervising, handling emergencies, solving difficult problems, conducting investigations and research, and creating conditions. This should be the focus of collective leadership.
Based on correctly handling the above-mentioned relationship, the Party has put forward the following basic ideas and approaches to adhere to and improve the democratic centralism in practice: (1) strengthen the education of the Party's democratic centralism and enhance the consciousness of implementing democratic centralism.
In the construction of the Party's democratic centralism, some party members and party organizations have a weak understanding of the Party's concept, party nature concept, and concept of organizational discipline, which is an important reason for the weak implementation of democratic centralism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of the Party's democratic centralism, focusing on educating party members and cadres on the Party's concept, party nature concept, and concept of organizational discipline, in order to enhance the consciousness of implementing democratic centralism.
In the education of party concepts, party members and cadres should be made aware of the Party's core leadership position and crucial role. The Party holds a core leadership position in its relations with various other organizations. The Party plays a crucial role in the advancement and development of the revolutionary cause. This position and role of the Party determine the extreme importance of implementing democratic centralism and achieving unity of the Party's organization, will, and actions. It should be clarified that only party members and cadres who recognize the Party's core leadership position and crucial role can have the consciousness to implement the principles of democratic centralism.
In the education of party nature concept, party members and cadres should be made aware that the Party has the proletariat and the broad masses of the people as its class foundation, represents the interests of the majority of the people, seeks benefits for the majority of the people, sacrifices personal interests for the interests of the majority, and sacrifices partial interests for the overall interests. It is the embodiment of the Party's purpose and party nature.Only party members and cadres who understand the party's mission and possess party consciousness can consciously adhere to the four obediences within the organization and avoid distorting the relationship of the four obediences due to personal or partial interests.
In terms of disciplinary education within the party's organization, we should help party members and cadres establish the correct relationship of the four obediences. In situations where their ideological understanding and party consciousness have not reached a level of self-awareness, they should abide by organizational principles and accept the constraints of organizational discipline.
(2) Effectively strengthen the construction of the democratic centralism system.
In the construction of democratic centralism within the party, the system is another weak link. Due to the lack of well-established and comprehensive specific systems, norms, and procedures in the party's internal life and leadership work, it is not easy for party members and cadres to follow, nor is it conducive to organizational operation and supervision. Therefore, establishing a complete set of clear, specific, systematic, and improved institutional norms and procedures to provide reliable institutional guarantees for democratic centralism is an important aspect of democratic centralism construction. In terms of the system of internal life, the focus is on formulating specific systems, norms, and procedures for elections, implementing and safeguarding the election rights of party members, and maintaining the democratic rights and the system of democratic life meetings for party members. In terms of decision-making systems, it includes the system of collective leadership, the system of discussing major issues, decision-making procedures, rules, and voting systems. In terms of supervision and inspection systems, it includes the reporting system for major issues and the supervision and inspection system for the implementation of decisions.
(3) Establish a working adjustment mechanism for the implementation of the principles of democratic centralism.
To ensure the implementation of decisions, it is necessary to prevent deviations from the original intent of decisions and avoid mechanical execution that lacks creativity. To strictly implement decisions while maintaining creativity, it is essential to establish a working adjustment mechanism. In the absence of a sound working adjustment mechanism, some party members, cadres, and lower-level organizations may act according to their own understandings and standards, resulting in a great deal of arbitrariness and occasionally inaccurate mastery, which may affect the correct implementation of decisions. Some organizations, based on the interests of their own units or local areas, may arbitrarily change the decisions of higher-level authorities under the pretext of being practical and creatively implementing them, resulting in distortions during implementation. It can be seen that the issue is not whether lower-level organizations and individuals can deviate from the implementation of resolutions, but rather the issue lies in the arbitrary deviation during the implementation process. Therefore, in order to combine implementation with creativity in the implementation of democratic centralism, a working adjustment mechanism must be established. If an individual or lower-level organization finds it inconvenient or impossible to execute a decision made by the organization or higher-level organization, they should report to the organization and higher-level organization within the specified time frame, and it is up to the organization and higher-level organization to decide whether or not to make changes. When the organization and higher-level organization refuse to change the original decision, individuals and lower-level organizations should resolutely obey and diligently carry it out. This way, implementation and creativity can be organically unified.
(4) Improve the supervision and constraint mechanisms and strictly enforce organizational discipline.
Supervision, inspection, and discipline are the ultimate guarantee mechanisms for democratic centralism. Only by incorporating the implementation of democratic centralism into effective supervision and holding violators accountable can the other conditions for the implementation of democratic centralism play an effective role and form a guiding mechanism. Supervision, inspection, and discipline are not only the guarantee conditions for the implementation of democratic centralism but also powerful means and guarantee mechanisms for leadership and management. The Party Central Committee requires that every leader and manager learn to use this means to implement leadership and management work, promote the development of various undertakings. 
Party Member Team Construction
The construction of the party member team is the foundation of the Party's organizational construction. The Party is composed of party members, and party members are the basis and the main body for implementing the Party's line. Strengthening the construction of the party member team is of great significance for consolidating the Party's organization, maintaining the proletarian vanguard nature of the Party, maintaining close relations between the Party and the masses, and fully exerting the Party's leadership. Therefore, in the Party's organizational construction, the construction of the party member team occupies a very important position.From the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1921 to the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, it was the initial period of the establishment of the Communist Party member team and the budding period of the theory of party member team construction. When the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, there were only over 50 party members. In response to the needs of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggles, the Party seized the key link of developing party members and establishing party organizations and continuously expanded the party member team. By September 1927, the party member team had grown to 57,967, and the party member team had begun to take shape. However, because our party was still in its infancy, it also showed immaturity in the construction of the party member team. This mainly manifested in three aspects: First, the uneven development of the party member team. From the distribution of party members in April 1927, it was concentrated in various southern provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, with fewer party members in northern provinces. In terms of the proportion of party member composition, there were more worker party members and fewer party members from other classes of laborers. There were more male party members and fewer female party members. Second, the exposition of the theory of party member team construction was limited to the aspects of party member development and party member education, and it ignored the importance of developing party members among peasants and soldiers. Third, Chen Duxiu believed that "the increase in the number of party members is the first important issue." If "the increase in the number of party members is not urgently sought, it is a slackening of the Party, it is a reactionary behavior." This erroneous guiding ideology resulted in the blind pursuit of quantity over quality in party member development work. This is an important lesson for the construction of the party member team during this period. After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the party suffered extremely heavy losses, with a large number of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses being massacred. The number of party members decreased from more than 57,000 to around 10,000, and the revolution was in an extremely critical situation. At this critical juncture of the Chinese revolution, the Party held the Eighth Party Congress, corrected Chen Duxiu's rightist mistakes, and established the general principles of land revolution and armed resistance against the Kuomintang reactionary clique. Subsequently, rural revolutionary base areas were established, and the road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and armed seizure of power was opened up, shifting the Party's work focus from the city to the countryside. Establishing the Party in the countryside and among the Red Army posed new problems in the history of Marxist party building. With Mao Zedong as the representative of the Chinese Communists, with extraordinary pioneering spirit, they successfully solved the problem of the construction of the Communist Party member team both in theory and practice. However, during this period, "a part of the Party's leading organs failed to grasp the correct political line and organizational line throughout this period", and the Party suffered from the harm of "left" leaning errors, especially Wang Ming's "left" leaning errors, which almost destroyed the Chinese revolution.In terms of the construction of party members, Wang Ming's "left" deviation was mainly manifested in: the development of the "only component theory" of party members; the quota-based and hasty recruitment of party members; in party life, the implementation of a patriarchal system, and the excessive internal struggle with "cruel struggle" and "relentless attacks". Due to Wang Ming's "left" deviation, the party suffered serious losses.
Therefore, from the Party's Eighth Congress in 1921 to the Zunyi Conference in 1935, it was a period of tortuous development for the Communist Party of China (CPC) membership and the basic formation period for the theoretical construction of the party membership. The Zunyi Conference held in 1935 ended the dominance of Wang Ming's "left" deviation in the Party Central Committee, established the correct leadership of the new Central Committee represented by Mao Zedong, and thus put the construction of the CPC membership on the right track. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee held in 1938 established the party's Marxist organizational line and marked the completion of the transformation of the party's organizational work since the Zunyi Conference, especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After entering the stalemate stage of the war, until 1941, the construction of the CPC membership was widely carried out, and the theoretical development of the construction of the CPC membership was further enriched and developed. The Yan'an Rectification Movement, which started preparing in May 1941 and ended at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in 1944, closely integrated the construction of the CPC membership with the rectification movement, indicating the deepening development of the construction of the CPC membership. After the victorious Seventh National Congress of the CPC in April 1945, it indicated the formation of a complete theoretical system for the construction of the CPC membership.
From the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan in August 1945 to the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, this period was a period of unprecedented development for the CPC membership and a period of rich and perfect theoretical construction of the CPC membership. During this period, in order to win the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Party made some major decisions on the construction of the CPC membership, thereby strengthening the party organization and enhancing the party's combat effectiveness.
The basic experience of the construction of the CPC membership during the period of the New Democratic Revolution is as follows: First, the construction of the CPC membership must be carried out under the condition of adhering to the nature of the vanguard of the proletariat. In China, a country where the number of proletarians is very small and the majority of the population consists of peasants and other petty bourgeoisie, it is an extremely arduous task to build a mass proletarian political party. Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, started from China's reality and put forward a party-building line suitable for the Chinese situation: "Emphasize ideological and political construction first, while also building organizationally." That is to say, party building should not only focus on the class composition of party members, but also realize proletarianization of thought through the transformation and overcoming of various non-proletarian thoughts among party members. Guided by this correct party-building line, during the period of the democratic revolution, the Party strengthened ideological construction and overcame non-proletarian thoughts among party members. It trained a large number of party members to become strong vanguard soldiers of the proletariat and built the Party into a mass, strong proletarian political party.
Second, in the process of recruiting party members, the relationship between quantity and quality must be correctly handled. In the work of developing party members, quantity and quality are contradictory aspects that are dialectically unified. On the one hand, the development of party members cannot be without a certain quantity and standards. Because of the arduous tasks of the Chinese revolution, the Communist Party of China needs sufficient strength to assume the important responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the Party must constantly increase its fresh blood and regularly and carefully absorb outstanding individuals who meet the conditions for party membership into the party organization. On the other hand, in the work of developing party members, attention must also be paid to quality.Because the quality of party members directly affects the nature of the party, and directly relates to the implementation of the party's line, policies, and the role of party leadership. Therefore, the quality issue is the core of developing party members and cannot be separated from quality when discussing the quantity of party members. During the democratic revolution, our party's successful experience was that while ensuring the quality of party members, we should also focus on developing the quantity, and not pursue quantity at the expense of quality.
Thirdly, the development of party organizations must follow the correct guiding principles. During the democratic revolution, there were two erroneous tendencies regarding the development of party members: one was laissez-faire, disregarding quality; the other was sectarianism, excluding some individuals who met the requirements for party membership. These two tendencies hindered the normal development of the party. In the struggle to overcome these tendencies, our party put forward the correct guideline of "developing boldly without allowing a single bad element to infiltrate," which overcame sectarianism, enabled the significant growth of party organizations, and maintained the party's purity.
Fourthly, to enhance the party's fighting capacity, we must effectively carry out party member education. Through education, party members should: enhance their ideological cultivation, firmly establish a revolutionary outlook on life; be loyal to the party politically, maintain a firm stance, be willing to sacrifice everything for the party, and never betray the party; strengthen their party consciousness, fulfill their obligations as party members, uphold party unity, and strictly observe party discipline; be proficient in their work, be proactive, and wholeheartedly serve the people. Party member education runs throughout the party's history, and it should be subordinate to and serve the party's line and central work. It should be based on helping party members establish a proletarian worldview and strengthen education especially during critical historical junctures. The principles, methods, and approaches of education should adhere to the principles of connecting theory with practice, hierarchical teaching, and self-guidance. Party organization life should be closely monitored, and rectification campaigns should be conducted.
The rich experience accumulated in long-term revolutionary struggles has enriched and improved the theoretical framework and policy guidelines for building the party's ranks.
Firstly, the correct guidelines for building the party's ranks have been formulated. That is, the guideline of "developing boldly without allowing a single bad element to infiltrate." It is necessary to overcome the tendency towards "sectarianism" and increase the vigilance against "infiltration by spies and opportunists." The long-term guiding principles for building the party's ranks are Mao Zedong's proposal that "the Communist Party should demonstrate its high degree of initiative in the national war; this kind of initiative should be specifically manifested in all aspects, that is, it should play a pioneering and exemplary role in all aspects." Communist Party members should be "models of courageous combat, models of executing orders, models of maintaining discipline, models of political work, models of internal unity"; models of high integrity, not seeking personal gains, working more and taking fewer rewards; models of seeking truth from facts, as well as having farsightedness and insight, models of learning. Only by "exerting their exemplary role to the highest degree" can Communist Party members mobilize all the dynamic forces of the nation and strive to overcome difficulties, defeat enemies, and build a new China.
Secondly, the specific and accurate standards for Communist Party members have been put forward. Namely: lifelong commitment to the struggle for communism; the revolution's interests take precedence over everything else; abide by party discipline, strictly keep party secrets; unwaveringly execute resolutions; be exemplary to the masses; and be committed to learning. Chen Yun believed that only those who possess these six conditions can truly be considered good Communist Party members and worthy of the great and honorable title of party member.
Thirdly, it comprehensively and scientifically expounded the issue of "party members". In the party constitution passed at the 7th Party Congress, the section on "party members" consists of 13 articles, including the basic requirements for party membership, the obligations of party members, the rights of party members, the development of party members, and the withdrawal and expulsion of party members. Among them, the obligations and rights of party members are specified for the first time. The party constitution specifies that the obligations of party members are: ① strive to improve their level of consciousness and understanding of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; ② strictly adhere to party discipline, actively participate in political life within the party and the revolutionary movement within the country, actively implement party policies and resolutions, and fight against any phenomena that harm the interests of the party; ③ serve the people, consolidate the party's connection with the masses, understand and timely reflect the needs of the people, and explain the party's policies to the people; ④ be exemplary in observing the discipline of the revolutionary government and revolutionary organizations, excel in their own work, and play a leading role in various revolutionary undertakings. The rights of party members are: ① the freedom to participate in practical discussions on the implementation of party policies at party meetings or in party publications; ② the right to vote and the right to be elected within the party; ③ the right to make suggestions and declarations to any party organization, including the central committee; ④ the right to criticize any party official at party meetings. These provisions not only indicate higher requirements of the party for its members and a more comprehensive intra-party democracy, but also demonstrate the maturity of the party.
Fourthly, it established the theory of communist party member cultivation. During this period, Liu Shaoqi combined the practical leadership of the Communist Party of China in revolutionary struggles, and conducted long-term and effective research and exploration on the issue of party member cultivation, forming a unique, complete, and systematic theory about the cultivation of party members. It proposed the necessity of cultivating party members' party spirit; the content of party spirit cultivation and the basic methods of party spirit cultivation, etc.
Fifthly, it successfully resolved the issue of party member education. ① The main content of internal party education: firstly, conducting Marxist-Leninist education, class education, and party education within the party, to enable party members to understand the correct relationship between Marxism-Leninism and the Three Principles of the People, the united front of the nation and the class struggle, the national position and the class position. Secondly, conducting education on historical materialism, so that party members truly understand "the laws of human social history development and the inevitable realization of communism", and understand "the historical status and role of the proletariat in society, comprehend the proletariat's interests and its great cause of liberating all of humanity, and grasp the current tasks and fundamental goals of the Communist Party and its members." Thirdly, conducting education that regards revolutionary interests as supreme, so that party members truly "give top priority to the interests of the revolutionary party, and handle all personal matters in accordance with the principle of prioritizing the interests of the revolution and the party." Fourthly, education on party discipline, so that party members "strictly adhere to the principle of personal obedience to the organization, compliance of the minority with the majority, subordination of lower levels to higher levels, and subordination of the entire party to the central committee as a basic principle." Fifthly, education for cadres at all levels of the party, mainly to "effectively improve the political level and work capacity of cadres." ② The form of Marxist ideological education. The central committee believes that the rectification movement is a good form of Marxist ideological education. On one hand, it earnestly studies the works of Marxism, studies the documents of the central committee, constantly improves the theoretical level of party members, and achieves ideological unity. On the other hand, it combines with practice, conducts serious criticism and self-criticism, overcomes all kinds of non-proletarian ideologies, and establishes the proletarian world outlook. ③ The issue of regularizing party school education. The central committee believes that party schools are important bases for training party cadres at all levels and theoretical cadres. In this regard, the central committee stipulates: the basic task of party schools at all levels is to "educate cadres with Marxist theory and practice"; the teaching method should be based on the principle of starting from the few and gradually increasing, from the shallow to the deep, from China to foreign countries, from the concrete to the abstract, in order to achieve the goal of enabling students to truly understand the subjects they have learned. The learning method should adopt the principle of personal self-study under the guidance of teachers as the main method, and use group discussions as an auxiliary method.
Sixth, the issue of the work attitude of party members and cadres. In October 1945, Mao Zedong clarified the correct attitude that party members and cadres should have towards work, regarding the problem of sending a large number of party members and cadres from Yan'an to the frontlines. He pointed out that "what is work? Work is struggle. Those places that have difficulties and problems need us to solve them. We work and struggle in order to solve these difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. That's what being a good comrade means." He called on party members and cadres to "enjoy giving others opportunities, pick up the heavier burdens, endure hardships before others, and enjoy privileges afterwards." He required all party members going to the frontlines to be mentally prepared, prepared to "take root and blossom among the people," and to "establish good relations with the masses, care for them, and help them solve difficulties." At the same time, he emphasized the need to "tell the people, tell our comrades that the road is tortuous," and to "be prepared to take the tortuous road." "We still face many difficulties that cannot be ignored," and we must "overcome all obstacles and achieve victory."
Seventh, the issue of party member development in base areas. Chen Yun pointed out that the development of party member should follow a "cautious policy" and that in the military, they must go through the test of battle or the struggle against internal traitors and deserters. Peasant party members must be selected after going through the test of struggle. He emphasized the conditions for developing party members: the three dares, which means daring to demand land, daring to struggle, and daring to arm oneself; the three fears, which means not fearing leaving home, not fearing landlords, and not fearing the Kuomintang. He stressed the need to adhere to active development, with selective methods of recruitment.
Eighth, the issue of internal party life. Chen Yun proposed three principles: 1) to honestly and openly differentiate right from wrong; 2) to strictly implement the democratic centralism within the party; 3) every party member has the right to express their opinions and discuss issues within the party, but they must also have the obligation to obey decisions and actively work. Mao Zedong proposed that "the party committee system is an important system to ensure collective leadership and prevent individual dictatorship within the party." He required party committees at all levels and party groups in various departments to "establish sound systems for party committee meetings," to discuss and solve major problems, and to implement decisions respectively. "Attention must also be paid to both collective leadership and individual responsibility, neither should be neglected."
Ninth, the issue of rectifying the party's ranks. The central leadership believed that it was necessary to rectify the forced commands in the party's work style, the deviation from the party's line and policies in ideology, and the selfish and self-serving tendencies, as well as the impure composition of party members. The central leadership prescribed the method for rectifying the party: first, convene two to three branch meetings to educate party members and prepare them mentally. At the same time, publicize the significance and methods of party rectification to the masses, and publish the list of party members.Then, convene a branch meeting with the participation of representatives of the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and listen to criticism and opinions from the masses, further carry out self-criticism and reflection within the party. Decisions should be made regarding party members who deserve disciplinary action, and modifications should be made regarding past mishandlings. Finally, democratic elections should be held to select a strong branch committee and team leaders to assume regular leadership of the branch, and a system of branch meetings and routines should be established to make the branch a true organization of advanced and conscious individuals - the highest form of class organization.
The tenth point is to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and strengthen the issue of ideological construction within the party. Mao Zedong pointed out: because of victory, there may arise an attitude of arrogance within the party, a complacency of considering oneself a hero, a stagnation of not seeking progress, and a desire for a life of luxury without wanting to go through hardships again. "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to applaud." There may be some Communists who "cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets" and "will be defeated in front of sugar bombs." He stressed that achieving national victory was only the first step in completing the long march, and the journey after the revolutionary victory is longer and the work more arduous. The entire party must continue to maintain the excellent style of humility, prudence, neither arrogance nor rashness, and hard work.
Section 4: Party style construction
I. Party style construction is a significant characteristic that sets the Communist Party of China apart from other political parties.
Party style construction is a unique style of our party. Putting the issue of style on the level of worldview, analyzing and resolving it in connection with the party line, is another significant characteristic of the self-construction of the Communist Party of China. It is organically linked with ideological and organizational construction. This is a major development of Marxist-Leninist party building theory.
The broad connotation of party style refers to a relatively stable style and spirit that a political party and its members often and repeatedly demonstrate in politics, ideology, organization, work, and life. The party style we usually talk about specifically refers to the style of the Communist Party of China, which is a customary term. It refers to the excellent style that has been formed by the Communist Party of China through long-term revolutionary practice, embodying the nature, purpose, and essential characteristics of the party. Mao Zedong was the first to propose the concept of party style and conducted a systematic exposition on it. In 1942, in the article "Rectify the Party's Style," he proposed opposing subjectivism to rectify the style of study, opposing sectarianism to rectify the party style, and opposing Party Eight-Legged Essays to rectify the literary style. In "On the Coalition Government," he explicitly proposed the three unique styles of Communists that distinguish them from any other political party, namely, integrating theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and criticism and self-criticism. In addition, through long-term practice, the Communist Party of China has also developed styles of humility and prudence, guarding against arrogance and rashness, conducting in-depth practical investigations and studies, treating people justly and equally, conducting business diligently and striving hard, democratic style, and sacrificing oneself for the truth and the interests of the people. All these reflect the nature of the party, and are related to the formulation and implementation of the party's lines, principles, and policies, as well as the realization of party leadership. Therefore, party style construction has always been an important part of party building. The introduction of the theory of party style construction enriches and develops the theory of proletarian party building of the Communist Party of China.
First, for the first time in the history of the development of the theory of proletarian party, the concept of party style was put forward, and new content of party style construction was added to the theory of party building.
From its birth, the proletarian party began to develop its unique style, different from other parties, and formed its own party style. However, for this actual formation and existence of party style to be theoretically manifested, that is, to form a systematic theory of party style construction, it is the result of the development of party style construction practice to a certain stage. From the perspective of the development history of proletarian parties around the world, when Marx and Engels were establishing some proletarian parties in Europe, they expounded more fully the reasons for establishing independent proletarian parties, the nature, worldview, program, line, and strategy of the proletarian party, without directly discussing the issue of party style. The practice of party style construction during this period focused on why to establish an independent proletarian party and how to build a vanguard party of the working class, and it aimed to ensure the ideological and political advancedness of the newly established proletarian party in terms of style, so as to assume the important task of leading and promoting the workers' movement in various countries. Marx and Engels' discussions on these aspects laid the theoretical foundation for party style construction, especially their communications with leaders of workers' movements in various countries, which covered more content related to party style and party style construction. There are two aspects that are more prominent and obvious.
First, when discussing the personal conduct of certain party members and leaders, they introduced the concept of "style". For example, in 1879, Engels criticized the social reformist Hugo Hirschberg's group for "bringing flattery and sycophancy into the party" in a letter to Johann Philipp Becker, a leader of the German workers' movement. In 1891, Engels pointed out in a letter to August Bebel that party leaders should be open-minded and "not so small-minded, and act with less Prussian style". In 1895, in a letter to Filippo Turati, a famous activist of the Italian workers' movement, Engels strongly criticized the harmful "superficial and insubstantial style" pursued by the Baccuninists. Here, the concept of "style" used by Engels mainly refers to the qualities and styles of party members and leaders, and it is only one aspect of the broader concept of party style. But after all, the concept of "style" has been put forward, becoming the initial form of the concept of party style in its formation process. Second, when expounding their own theories of party building, they put forward certain basic principles closely related to party style construction. For example, they emphasized that party members must have "pure qualities" and "voluntarily put themselves in the ranks of fighters", and "guard against the transformation of the state and state organs from public servants to masters of society"; "I do not advocate raising any banners of dogmatism", "Marx's entire worldview is not a doctrine, but a method"; "criticism is the lifeblood of the workers' movement"; "relentless self-criticism" is the manifestation of the party's great internal strength. In fact, it proposed the idea that the proletariat must develop a good style of close contact with the masses, theoretical integration with practice, criticism and self-criticism.
In the process of leading the Russian Bolshevik Party, Lenin put into practice and developed the ideas of Marx and Engels on party style construction, especially the ideas of strengthening style construction under the conditions of party governance. After the October Revolution, Lenin repeatedly criticized the bureaucracy and procrastinating style of the party, and warned that one of the greatest and most serious dangers of the ruling party is to be alienated from the masses. It is necessary to resolutely fight against the infiltration of bureaucracy and the mindset of seeking personal gain within the party, and the misuse of party and Soviet authority by party members. After Lenin, Stalin further proposed the concept of "work style" and further elaborated on the two characteristics of "Leninist style": the first is the revolutionary courage of the Russian people, and the second is the practical spirit of the American people.The style of Leninism is the combination of these two characteristics in the work of the party and the country. Although limited by historical conditions, Lenin and Stalin were unable to clearly propose a scientific concept of "party style" and did not form a systematic theory of party style construction. However, their theoretical inheritance and development of Marx and Engels' discussions on party style construction, especially their exploration of party style construction and resistance against bureaucratic and other undesirable practices after the party came to power, undoubtedly played an important role in the formation of the theory of party style construction. Mao Zedong inherited and developed the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on party style construction in the new historical conditions of the Chinese revolution. He followed the trajectory of "style" - "Leninist work style" - "party style" development, summarized the fresh experience of building a vanguard party of the working class under semi-colonial and semi-feudal social conditions, clearly proposed the scientific concept of "party style," and established the concept of party style construction theory with Chinese Communist characteristics. This is the theoretical sublimation of the unique experience of the style construction of the Communist Party of China. The special conditions of self-construction and leading the revolutionary struggle for the Communist Party of China determine the special importance of the party's attitude towards Marxism, the people, its own shortcomings and mistakes, and the difficulties and failures, successes and victories in the revolution. The fundamental requirement for building a Marxist political party in China, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal Eastern country, is to arm the entire party with Marxist theory. This raises the question of how to approach Marxism: adopting a realistic and pragmatic attitude towards Marxist theory or adopting a subjective attitude. This is related to whether the party can truly become the vanguard of the working class, whether the party can truly assume the historical responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution, and whether the cause of the Chinese revolution will thrive or decline. 
The proletariat and communists in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China were small in number, and the revolutionary forces at the beginning were just a few "sparks." The enemies of the Chinese revolution, on the other hand, were very powerful and brutal imperialists, feudalists, and bureaucratic capitalists. To defeat the powerful enemy with weak revolutionary forces, the party must adhere to a historical materialist attitude and treat the people correctly, maintaining the closest possible contact with the masses. China's national conditions are different from those of Western Europe and Russia. The contradictions are extremely complex and unique. It is very difficult to correctly understand China's national conditions, formulate and implement practical lines, principles, and policies, and achieve the victory of the revolution. In the process of realizing this difficult task, it is difficult to avoid making various mistakes. Any mistake will cause some losses to the interests of the people, so criticism and self-criticism are indispensable for a party that is highly responsible for the people. Our party, under such historical conditions, advocated and cultivated by Mao Zedong personally, gradually formed a good style of linking theory with practice, closely connecting with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing. The concept of "party style" is the generalization of the unique experience of the Communist Party of China in carrying out party style construction and meets the needs of building a good party style for the Communist Party of China.
The concept of party style proposed by Mao Zedong inherits and develops the concept of "style" put forward by Engels and the concept of "style" used by Lenin to criticize bureaucratic and procrastinating style in the party and Soviet state organs after the October Revolution until Stalin proposed and argued for the concept of "Leninist work style". This development is manifested in the subject of behavior, from the attitude and style of individual party members or cadres to the overall image and style of party organizations. Party style is not only the style of individual party members, but also the overall style of party organizations.
Secondly, in terms of the connotation and extension of Party conduct, it mainly refers to the personal conduct and work style of Party members or officials, expanding to various aspects such as politics, ideology, organization, and daily life. It encompasses the academic style and literary style within the concept of Party conduct, thereby revealing the intrinsic connection between Party conduct, Party character, and the Party's worldview.Secondly, Mao Zedong proposed the concept of Party conduct, discussing the importance of Party conduct in realizing the Party's political leadership, and emphasizing that strengthening Party conduct is an important guarantee for implementing the Party's political line.
In his article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," Mao Zedong pointed out: "We are the Communist Party. We must lead the people to overthrow the enemy. Our team must be orderly, our steps must be consistent, our soldiers must be well-trained, and our weapons must be good. If we do not possess these conditions, then the enemy will not be defeated by us." This tells us that in order for the Party to lead the people in accomplishing the political task of defeating the enemy, it must possess the conditions in terms of ideology, politics, organization, and style. Mao Zedong believed that at that time, the Party's political line was correct. The problem was that there were still improper aspects in our Party conduct, including subjectivism, sectarianism, and formalism. Therefore, in order to realize the Party's political leadership and implement the Party's political line, it is necessary to rectify the Party's style of work. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong, our Party went through the rectification movement in Yan'an, overcame the three unhealthy trends within the Party, strengthened Party conduct, and ensured the realization of the Party's political leadership. On the basis of achieving great victory in the rectification movement, our Party held the 7th National Congress. In Mao Zedong's political report "On the Coalition Government," he further discussed the significant meaning of promoting the Party's fine conduct in realizing the Party's Seventh Line. Due to the adherence and promotion of the three fine conduct advocated by Mao Zedong, all levels of Party organizations and a large number of Party members and officials were able to unite with the local conditions of their respective regions and units, creatively and perseveringly implementing the Party's political line, so that the Party's line, as well as the guidelines and policies formulated to implement this line, could truly become the practical actions of hundreds of millions of people. In this way, it effectively ensured the realization of the Party's political leadership and the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the great victory of the Liberation War. Historical experience has proven that promoting the Party's fine conduct and strengthening Party conduct is indeed an important guarantee for implementing the Party's political line and achieving the Party's political leadership.
Thirdly, Mao Zedong's concept of Party conduct discusses the important position of Party conduct issues in the Party's own construction, emphasizing the significant significance of strengthening Party conduct in maintaining the nature of the Party as the vanguard of the proletariat.
The reason why our Party highlights the construction of Party conduct in the Party's construction is because the issue of Party conduct is closely related to the nature of the Party as the vanguard of the working class and the Party's worldview. Any improper style within the Party is a violation of the Party's nature and the Party's worldview, thus it is "a great enemy of the Communist Party, a great enemy of the working class, a great enemy of the people, a great enemy of the nation, and a manifestation of impure Party character." On the other hand, a completely upright style within the Party is the criterion for practicing Marxism faithfully and maintaining the nature of the Party as the vanguard of the working class. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize and address the construction of Party conduct from the perspective of the Party's worldview and attach importance to the nature of the Party. This is another characteristic of our Party's self-construction.
As early as the period of the land revolution war, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai realized the significance of Party conduct issues for the healthy development of the Party's body. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong specifically considered the construction of Party conduct as an integral part of the Party's self-construction and took various effective measures to consciously correct improper trends within the Party, promote the Party's fine conduct, and strengthen the construction of Party conduct. Mao Zedong profoundly discussed the importance of adhering to the Party's fine conduct, believing that the three fine conduct of our Communist Party is a prominent characteristic that distinguishes us from any other political parties.This statement tells us that the issue of party conduct is directly related to the nature of the party. By adhering to and promoting the party's good conduct, the nature of the party as the vanguard of the proletariat can be maintained. Disregarding the party's good traditions and conduct will seriously affect the nature of the party as the vanguard of the proletariat, and if the party conduct becomes completely corrupt, it may lead to a transformation of the party's nature. It is precisely because our party attaches great importance to the significant role of party conduct in maintaining the nature of the vanguard party that we have always been able to consciously strengthen the construction of party conduct in the practice of party building. This is an important reason why our party has been able to maintain its nature as the vanguard of the proletariat in a country where peasants make up the majority.
Mao Zedong raised the issue of party conduct to the level of maintaining the nature of the party. This not only has important practical significance for guiding us to consciously strengthen the construction of party conduct, but also has significant theoretical significance in social life for people to judge and identify whether a party is truly a vanguard organization of the proletariat. Marxists believe that every political party has its own program, theory, and conduct. To judge what kind of party a party is, one must not only look at its theory and program, but also its conduct. Marx and Engels were the first to put forward a scientific proposition that the nature of a party can be judged based on its program, emphasizing that the program of a party is a banner openly established, and the outside world judges the party based on its political program. Lenin and Stalin, in response to the betrayal of Marxist theory by revisionists in the era of imperialism, proposed the famous proposition that the nature of a party can be judged based on whether it adheres to the basic principles of Marxism. They believed that any political party that adheres to the basic principles of Marxism is a new type of proletarian revolutionary party, while any political party that betrays the basic principles of Marxism is a party of revisionism or reformism. Mao Zedong, based on the social and historical conditions of the Communist Party of China, further proposed that the issue of conduct is an important indicator for judging the nature of a political party. This is a significant contribution to the theory of Marxist-Leninist party construction and an important contribution to the construction of party conduct.
Fourthly, it discusses the importance of strengthening the construction of party conduct in maintaining the high prestige of the party among the masses, emphasizing that only by rectifying the party conduct can the popular sentiment and social atmosphere be improved.
Starting from the basic perspective of historical materialism, Mao Zedong believed that the issue of people's support or opposition determines the future and fate of a party. If the people support the party, it has strength, vitality, and is invincible; if the people withdraw their support, the party has no strength, loses vitality, and is defeated. So, what factors determine people's support or opposition? For a political party, the most direct and easily discernible factor for the people is the issue of party conduct. From historical experience, an important factor that determines whether the people support the party is whether the party's actions are beneficial to them, especially whether the words and actions of the party members and cadres serve their interests, which determines whether they support and endorse the party. For a long time, because our Communist Party is selfless, putting the interests of others before our own, always working hard and enduring hardship, sacrificing for the sake of the masses, closely connecting with the masses, and even being willing to shed blood and sacrifice to protect the interests of the masses, we have won the trust, support, love, and endorsement of the masses. Historical experience tells us that the issue of party conduct is actually the issue of how the party appears to the people, and it directly affects whether the party can maintain its high prestige among the masses. It is precisely because of this that Mao Zedong consistently emphasized that we must adhere to and promote the party's good traditions and conduct, and always serve as exemplary models: on the battlefield, we should be models of bravery; in the rear area, we should be models of base construction; in our work, we should be models in shouldering heavy responsibilities; in our lives, we should be models of hardship and struggle; and in our relationships with comrades, we should be models of unity and mutual assistance, and so on.
Mao Zedong believes that the issue of Party conduct not only directly affects the Party's lofty prestige among the masses, but also directly influences and even to some extent determines the national ethos. When discussing the importance of rectifying the Party's conduct in 1942, Mao pointed out that our Communist Party is the leader of the people's revolutionary cause, and the conduct of our Party has a great influence on the entire nation. "As long as the conduct of our Party is completely upright, the people of the whole country will follow us. Those outside the Party who exhibit such negative traits, as long as they are good-hearted, will learn from us and correct their mistakes, thus affecting the entire nation." Mao Zedong clearly linked Party conduct with the national ethos, which not only can stimulate the initiative of all Party members to uphold Party conduct, but also can enhance their political sense of responsibility in transforming social norms. This important idea has significant guiding significance for today's efforts to rectify Party conduct, promote progress in social norms, and strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization.Through arduous exploration, our Party has put forward and established effective methods and measures to strengthen the construction of Party conduct: first, raising the issue of Party conduct to the level of world view and Party nature for resolution. Our Party has always believed that Party conduct is closely related to its world view, and Party conduct is the concrete manifestation of the Party's world view in action. The world view of our Communist Party is dialectical materialism and historical materialism. The world view of dialectical materialism is manifested in the Party's actions by the unity of theory and practice, seeking truth from facts, and linking theory with practice; the world view of historical materialism is manifested in the Party's actions by believing in the masses, relying on the masses, maintaining close ties with the masses. With the world view of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, Communists will fear nothing in all practical activities. They dare to criticize various negative phenomena within the Party and in society, and are brave enough to engage in self-criticism. Therefore, the three major commendable conduct of the Party are the concrete manifestation of the Marxist world view in the Party's actions.
Since Party conduct is the manifestation of the Party's world view in action, promoting commendable Party conduct and overcoming negative trends must focus on resolving issues from the perspective of world view. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Mao Zedong addressed the issue of Party conduct by focusing on resolving issues from the perspectives of world view and outlook on life. First, he wrote works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction", conducting criticism of the negative conduct of subjectivism and dogmatism from the perspective of world view, and profoundly expounded the Marxist world view of dialectical materialism, laying the ideological and theoretical foundation for the smooth development of the Yan'an Rectification Movement. Then, the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong guided senior Party cadres and all Party members to start from studying Marxist theory and Party documents, conducting investigations and research, and using the method of criticism and self-criticism to further resolve the issue of Party members' world view. Resolving the issue of Party members' world view mainly means guiding Party members to apply the basic principles of Marxism and connect them with their own ideological and work realities, consciously transforming their subjective world. The transformation of the subjective world has two basic aspects: the transformation of ideological consciousness and the transformation of ideological methods. The former pertains to the issue of improving ideological and political awareness, while the latter relates to the problem of enhancing cognitive abilities. These two aspects of improvement are the main problems to be addressed in the transformation of the subjective world. Since our Party firmly grasped the fundamental issue of transforming the world view during the Rectification Movement, we effectively overcome the problem of the "Three Winds" and ensured the success of the Yan'an Rectification Movement. The three major commendable conduct of the Party were put forward on the basis of this great victory in the Rectification Movement. This historical experience tells us that only by raising the issue of Party conduct to the level of world view can we effectively overcome negative trends and firmly establish commendable conduct.
In the construction of party conduct, Mao Zedong attached great importance to party character education, which is the central link to solve the problem of party conduct from the perspective of worldview. He believed that party conduct is precisely a manifestation of impure party character. To thoroughly overcome improper conduct, it is necessary to strengthen party character cultivation and enhance the proletarian party character. During the Yan'an rectification period, under the guidance of Mao Zedong, our party specifically made a decision on enhancing party character, pointing out various manifestations of impure party character and proposing various measures to enhance party character. This has played a positive role in promoting the development of the party's fine style and overcoming various improper conduct. At the same time, Liu Shaoqi also made a report on "The Cultivation of Communists", giving a systematic discussion on party character cultivation. Party character cultivation, in short, means that communist party members consciously use the fine qualities of the proletarian vanguard to educate and transform themselves, gradually acquiring these fine qualities of the proletarian vanguard. An important characteristic of party character cultivation is that it mainly relies not on external force and compulsion, but on the consciousness and self-improvement of party members to elevate ideological awareness. Party organization education is of utmost importance. The effect of this education lies in mobilizing the inherent positive factors of party members, relying on their own positive factors to overcome their negative factors. Mao Zedong believed that if a communist party member and cadre have a strong party character, they can fully play a vanguard and exemplary role in various work. This vanguard and exemplary role concretely embodies the fine style of the party. Therefore, strengthening party character cultivation is the fundamental measure to develop the party's fine style and overcome various improper conduct.
Another important aspect and measure to solve the problem of party conduct from the perspective of worldview is to strengthen investigation and research. Mao Zedong believed that "implementing investigation and research throughout the party is the fundamental link in transforming the party's style." He had a famous saying: "No investigation, no right to speak." This view is a vivid summary of his practical experience in conducting investigation and research for a long time, and it is also a vivid embodiment of his application of Marxist dialectical materialism epistemology to the party's practical work. This is an important condition for rectifying the party's conduct.
Secondly, a good form of comprehensive party rectification was created, which is a major measure to rectify party conduct and strengthen party conduct construction.
In order to more effectively overcome the negative work style within the party, promote the party's fine style, and improve the party's quality, our party has also created a good form of comprehensive party rectification. The so-called comprehensive party rectification means focusing on the party's ideology, work style, and organization for a comprehensive rectification within a certain period of time. Specifically, our party selects several classic works, party internal documents, and other works and reports by central leaders with leadership, purpose, planning, and steps to review and criticize, in connection with the actual situation of ideology, work style, organization, and work. This aims to improve the Marxist theoretical level and ideological and political consciousness of the broad masses of party members and cadres, overcome deficiencies and mistakes in work, and achieve the goal of unifying thinking, rectifying work style, strengthening discipline, purifying the organization, and improving the party's combat effectiveness.
From the anti-Japanese war to the establishment of the new China, our party has conducted three successful campaigns of comprehensive party rectification. The first one was the Yan'an rectification in 1942...The most prominent achievement of this rectification movement, as Mao Zedong put it, "lies in enabling our leading organs and many cadres to further grasp the unity of the general truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution as a basic direction." The second instance was the Party rectification during the land reform in 1948. This rectification exposed the existence of impure elements and inappropriate work styles within the party to some extent, overcoming the tendency of some cadres in rural grassroots organizations to disconnect from the masses. The third instance was the rectification and rectification movement in the early stages of the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This rectification and rectification movement universally raised the ideological and political awareness of Communist Party members, purified the party's ranks, consolidated the party's relationship with the masses, and strengthened party leadership.
From the above historical experience, it is indeed an effective form of strengthening party discipline to carry out rectification and rectification. This is because: First, rectification and rectification is a systematic and mass Marxist ideological education movement. Through this form of education, the theoretical level and political consciousness of the entire party will be greatly improved, communist ideology will be greatly promoted, and individualism and other non-proletarian ideologies will be further overcome, providing a reliable ideological guarantee for rectifying the party's style. Second, rectification and rectification is a comprehensive rectification of the party's style and organization with leadership, planning, and organization, which can effectively achieve "comprehensive governance," that is, effectively correct unfavorable trends such as particularism, bureaucratism, subjectivism, and commandism from various aspects, and effectively overcome phenomena such as paternalism, sectarianism, anarchism, liberalism, and extreme democratization without organization and discipline. In particular, in the later stages of rectification and rectification, organizational review and organizational measures should be carried out, not only disciplining those who have committed serious mistakes but also purging those elements and corrupt individuals who harm the party and oppose the party, in order to achieve the goal of purifying the organization. In this way, rectification and rectification provide a reliable organizational guarantee for rectifying the party's style. Therefore, rectification and rectification is an effective form of rectifying the party's style and a significant measure for our party to strengthen its work style. This excellent form of rectification and rectification is a great innovation by Mao Zedong in the history of proletarian party-building.
II. The style of integrating theory with practice
The excellent style of combining theory with practice focuses on the basic qualities and styles that communists should have in understanding and transforming the objective world. The basic point of this style is that one must understand the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and only when it is combined with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution does it truly become a weapon for the Chinese people to win all battles.
In the long practice of revolutionary struggle, the Communist Party of China has adhered to and developed the scientific principles of integrating Marxist theory with practice, elevating it to the level of a fundamental principle of Marxism.
The Communist Party of China believes that integrating theory with practice is not only an important ideological principle but also an important methodological principle. This methodological principle can be summarized as follows: First, the Marxist worldview is not a doctrine but a method. It does not provide ready-made dogmas but rather a starting point for further research and a method for conducting such research. Second, theory must be combined with practice, which is a scientific approach to achieving the unity of the subjective and objective, and the consistency of theory and practice. It is also an objective requirement for the purpose of understanding and transforming the world. Third, theory can only be enriched and developed through its combination with practice. This is an inherent requirement for the development of theory.
Firstly, the combination of theory and practice is the methodological principle for correctly handling the dialectical relationship between theory and practice. Without practical application, theory becomes empty; without theoretical foundation, practice becomes blind. Throughout the history of our party, both dogmatism and empiricism have been characterized by the separation of theory and practice, and the division of subjectivity and objectivity. Dogmatists fail to understand that Marxism is not a doctrine, but a methodology. They detach the universal principles of Marxism from the practicality of the Chinese revolution, refuse to conduct in-depth research on the Chinese revolution, and instead apply Marxism as an abstract doctrine without considering the specific circumstances. The result is that the Chinese revolution faces crisis, with Wang Ming's "ultra-left" dogmatism being the most severe example in the history of the party. On the other hand, empiricism creates a dichotomy between the universal principles of Marxism and the concrete reality of the Chinese revolution, denying the guiding role of Marxist principles in practice. They fail to understand that "without a theory of revolution, there can be no revolutionary movement" and are satisfied with superficial success, falling into the trap of empiricism. Both tendencies separate theory from practice. Only by adhering to the method of linking theory with practice, combining Marxist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution, can we guide the Chinese revolution towards victory.
Secondly, the combination of theory and practice is a methodological principle for achieving the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, and the consistency of knowledge and reality. The fundamental problem of philosophy is the relationship between thought and existence. This problem encompasses two aspects: firstly, which comes first between thought and existence, spirit and matter, subjectivity and objectivity; secondly, whether there is unity between thought and existence, spirit and matter, subjectivity and objectivity. The first aspect concerns the question of which determines the other between thought and existence, while the second aspect concerns how to achieve dialectical unity between thought and existence - the interrelationship, interdependence, and transformation. The fundamental problem of philosophy, when reflected in reality, reveals itself as the relationship between theory and practice. Theory originates from practice and, in turn, provides guidance for practice. The unity of theory and practice reflects the unity of thought and existence, subjectivity and objectivity. The method of combining theory with practice, or theory's connection to reality, provides us with a scientific approach to achieving the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, knowledge and reality. At the same time, the method of combining theory and practice also embodies the highest principle of Marxist philosophy. The purpose of understanding the world is to transform the world, and the combination of theory and practice is precisely the means to achieve this purpose, uniting the understanding of the world with the transformation of the world through scientific methods.
Furthermore, the combination of theory and practice is the methodological principle for the development of theory. Theory originates from practice and is tested and developed in practice. The detachment of theory from practice is the fundamental epistemological root cause of theory becoming stagnant and practice failing. Objective phenomena are constantly in motion, changing, and developing, and people's understanding should also develop with the concrete process of objective phenomena. Generally speaking, theory, as a form of subjective understanding, has a certain degree of stability, while objective phenomena are constantly changing and developing. This creates a contradiction and a dynamic process between subjectivity and objectivity, theory and practice. The task of human understanding is to seek the concrete and historical unity between these two aspects.When the concrete process of objective practice has progressed, subjective understanding should also change accordingly. If understanding remains at its original stage, there will be errors where theory lags behind practice. When the concrete process of objective practice is not yet complete, forcing future tasks to be done in the present will also lead to errors of subjective-objective separation. The method of integrating theory with practice is precisely the dialectical method of achieving the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, theory and practice in a concrete historical sense. Theory is constantly tested, revised, supplemented, enriched, and developed in the process of combining with practice.
From the perspective of our party's practice during the democratic revolution period, the following three aspects are highlighted in terms of the integration of theory and practice: First, one must have a good command of Marxism and learn to apply Marxist theory to analyze and explain China's actual problems.
Marxist theory is the scientific summary of the practical experience of proletarian revolution, it reflects the general situation and universal laws of proletarian revolution, and has universal guiding significance for proletarian revolution in various countries. However, in order to guide the proletarian revolution in various countries using Marxist theory, it is necessary to first apply Marxist theory to analyze and explain the specific realities of each country, and integrate Marxist theory with the specific realities of each country.
In the Chinese revolution, dogmatists did not understand this. They "only know how to selectively quote Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's individual words and phrases, but do not know how to apply their positions, viewpoints, and methods to study China's current situation and history, and specifically analyze and solve China's revolutionary problems." Mao Zedong criticized their mistakes and pointed out that their approach "violates a basic principle that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have repeatedly admonished people with: the unity of theory and practice." Therefore, they demanded a purposeful study of the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and looked for positions, viewpoints, and methods from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to solve China's revolutionary theoretical and strategic problems, and applied the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism to study China's current situation and history, so as to "be able to correctly interpret practical problems that have occurred in history and revolution based on the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and provide scientific explanations and theoretical explanations for various economic, political, military, and cultural problems in China." It is clearly pointed out that this attitude is the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, "it is an expression of party spirit, it is the style of Marxism-Leninism that combines theory and practice in unity," and "it is an attitude that a communist should possess at the very least." It can be seen that Mao Zedong regarded the application of Marxist theory to analyze and explain China's reality as an important content of the integration of theory and practice.
Second, we must be grounded in practice, combining Marxist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution.
Marxist theory is a powerful ideological weapon for the proletariat to understand and transform the world. Adhering to the principle of integrating theory with practice is to fully exert the tremendous role of Marxist theory in understanding and transforming the world.
In the practice of the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong attached great importance to the combination of theory and practice and regarded this combination as an important content of integrating theory with practice. In "On Practice," he quoted Stalin's words: if theory is not related to practice, it becomes a theory without an object, and similarly, if practice is not guided by revolutionary theory, it becomes blind practice. In order to draw attention to the combination of theory and practice within the party, he raised this combination to the level of party spirit principles, believing that "without a scientific attitude, that is, a Marxist-Leninist attitude of unity between theory and practice, it is called lack of party spirit or incomplete party spirit...
"How can we combine Marxist theory with the practice of revolution in China? On one hand, Mao Zedong localized, popularized, and massified Marxist theory, integrating it with the practical activities of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses. He pointed out, 'Communist Party members are Marxists of the international community, but Marxism must be combined with the specific characteristics of our country and realized through a certain national form.' Therefore, he demanded that Marxism be made specific to China, so that it carries the necessary Chinese characteristics and style, making it accessible and applicable to the largest masses of people in China. On the other hand, Mao Zedong concretized Marxist theory as the ideological, working, and leadership methods of the Party, integrating Marxist theory with the revolutionary practice conducted by Chinese Communists. The Communist Party of China is the leading core of the Chinese revolutionary cause, the organizer and leader of the Chinese revolutionary cause. Combining Marxist theory with the practice of revolution in China is also combining it with their practice. In the long-term revolutionary practice, Mao Zedong developed a set of scientific methods of thinking, working, and leading. These methods are not only the concretization of Marxist theory, but also the basic principles and methods that our Party must follow in all its work. His concept of 'one divides into two' is both a popular and mass expression of dialectical materialism, and an effective basic method that our Party follows in all its work. His leadership and working method of 'coming from the masses and going to the masses' are both the line and method that our Party must follow in all its work, as well as the concretization of Marxist epistemology and historical materialism. In this way, he transformed Marxist theory into the guiding principle of our Party's actions, organically combining Marxist theory with the practical activities of the Chinese revolutionary practice.
Thirdly, we need to take the development of theory as the highest goal, summarize new theories from the practice of the Chinese revolution, and enrich and develop Marxism.
Marxist theory comes from the practical struggle of the proletariat and has been proven by the practical struggle of the proletariat to be a scientific truth. Like any truth, it does not end the truth, but opens up the path to it. With the changes in objective reality and the development of practice, Marxist theory must also be constantly enriched and developed. Otherwise, Marxist theory will not be able to explain and illustrate objective reality well, will not be able to effectively guide practice, and will inevitably lead to the separation of theory and practice. It is precisely based on this point that the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the enrichment and development of Marxist theory in revolutionary practice and regards the enrichment and development of Marxist theory as an important content of theoretical connection with practice. In the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong regarded the enrichment and development of Marxist theory as an important content of theoretical connection with practice, and explicitly pointed out, 'Chinese communists can only be said to have a connection between theory and practice if they are good at applying the theories of Lenin and Stalin to the study of Chinese historical and revolutionary reality and make theoretical creations that meet the practical needs of China in all aspects.' Mao Zedong later further stated that the books of Marx, Engels, and Lenin must be read first. However, communist intellectuals of any country, proletarian intellectuals of any country, must create new theories, write new works, and produce their own theorists to serve the current politics. In any country, at any time, relying solely on old things is not enough.
The three aspects of the theoretical connection with practice in the thought of the Communist Party of China are both interrelated and have their own emphasis. From the perspective of connection, the three aspects of theoretical connection with practice are a closely connected and indivisible organic whole. Using Marxist theory to analyze and explain China's practical problems is the basis or premise of theoretical connection with practice."To apply Marxist theory to the specific reality of China, the first step is to use Marxist theory to analyze and explain the practical problems of China, so as to make Marxist theory consistent with the specific reality of China. Without analyzing and explaining the specific reality of China, it is impossible to combine Marxist theory with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction, and it is impossible to talk about enriching and developing Marxist theory. Combining Marxist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution is the fundamental way to link theory with practice. Without this combination, analyzing and explaining practical problems would lose its meaning, and Marxist theory would not be able to become a great force to transform the world and change reality. It would inevitably result in the separation of theory and practice, and enriching and developing Marxist theory would only be an empty talk. The summary of new theories from the practice of the Chinese revolution, and the enrichment and development of Marxism, are necessary requirements for linking theory with practice. Objective reality is diverse and constantly changing, and revolutionary practice is constantly deepening and developing. Theory, as a reflection of objective reality and a summary of practical experience, must also change with the changes in objective reality and develop with the development of practice. Otherwise, theory will lag behind reality. From the perspective of differentiation, the three aspects of the connection between theory and practice each have their own emphasis, forming three levels from low to high. Analyzing and explaining the specific reality of China using Marxist theory focuses on understanding and comprehending the specific reality of Chinese society, politics, economy, military, culture, and so on. It only solves the problem of how to correctly perceive and reflect objective reality. This kind of connection between theory and practice is a low-level connection. Combining Marxist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution and construction focuses on using Marxist theory to transform and change objective reality. It solves the problem of how Marxist theory can transform the world and change reality. Because it not only stays at the level of reflecting objective reality, but also delves into the transformation and change of objective reality. Therefore, this connection between theory and practice is a higher level of connection than using Marxist theory to analyze and explain the specific reality of China. The summary of new theories from the practice of the Chinese revolution, and the enrichment and development of Marxism, focuses on summarizing and summarizing practical experience, conducting theoretical creation, and solving the problem of how Marxist theory reflects the changing and developing objective reality, and guides the practice of continuous development. Because it not only reflects objective reality and guides practice, but also further enriches theory. Therefore, this connection between theory and practice is a high-level connection. If we deny the difference between them, mix the three levels of content indiscriminately, or replace the high-level connection with a low-level connection, it will inevitably lead to the separation of theory and practice and unconsciously violate the principle of linking theory with practice.
III. The Style of Criticism and Self-criticism
Adhering to the style of criticism and self-criticism is about the character and style that Communists should have in correctly understanding and transforming the subjective world. The basic point of this style is that transforming the old society and establishing a new society is a difficult and new cause. In the long process of revolution, making some mistakes, and even serious ones, is inevitable. Adhering to truth and correcting mistakes is a necessary path for a revolutionary party and a Communist to mature and succeed. Criticism and self-criticism are the driving forces for the party to correct mistakes and move forward. "Criticism and self-criticism are an inherent requirement for the survival and development of the Communist Party." The revolutionary mentors attached great importance to and repeatedly emphasized the use of criticism and self-criticism as a weapon when establishing the proletarian party. Marx insisted on criticizing the bourgeoisie and various erroneous trends within the international workers' movement throughout his life. Engels explicitly pointed out that criticism is the essence of the life of the workers' movement. He regarded mutual criticism as a means to strengthen unity, saying: "The unity of democratic forces in various countries does not exclude mutual criticism. Without such criticism, unity cannot be achieved."
Without criticism, mutual understanding is impossible, and thus unity cannot be achieved. He also emphasized that a proletarian party must have the courage to criticize and engage in self-criticism. The presence or absence of this courage indicates whether the party is strong or weak, whether it can withstand various tests. He proudly said, "Where else is there another political party daring to do this?" 
In the process of establishing and leading the proletarian revolutionary party, Lenin attached great importance to cultivating a culture of self-criticism. He believed that self-criticism is absolutely necessary for any vibrant and lively political party. He believed that the attitude a party holds towards its own mistakes is the most important and reliable measure of whether the party is serious and truly fulfills its obligations to its own class and the working masses. Publicly admitting mistakes, exposing the reasons for the mistakes, analyzing the environment that led to the mistakes, and carefully discussing methods to correct the mistakes - these are the signs of a serious party. These are the parties fulfilling their responsibilities, educating and training the class, and even the masses. 
The fundamental reason for the difference between the proletarian party and other parties lies in the fact that it is a party that does not seek any personal interests. Its purpose is to serve the people wholeheartedly, which provides the possibility for criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are our party's valuable traditions and political advantages. 
The Communist Party of China, guided by Marxism and established according to Lenin's principles of party building, inherited the fine traditions of criticism and self-criticism in the international socialist movement, and in the practice of leading the Chinese revolution, it has creatively developed its own characteristic style of criticism and self-criticism. 
Within our party, the first generation of central leadership core with Mao Zedong at the center first created a new method of rectification and self-improvement, with criticism and self-criticism as the main means. Starting from the period of rectification in Yan'an, Mao Zedong often used metaphors such as "washing one's face every day", "cleaning the floor every day", "running water does not stagnate", and "the hinge does not rust" to vividly and profoundly explain the necessity of self-criticism for communists. He pointed out that there always exists contradiction between advanced and backward, correct and incorrect within the party. The progress of the party is built upon the constant development and resolution of these contradictions, and criticism and self-criticism are the main methods of resolving internal contradictions within the party. Mao Zedong said, "Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is wholly just and are willing to sacrifice everything personal, are always ready to devote their lives to our cause. Is there any thought, opinion, view or method that does not conform to the needs of the people, which we are unwilling to discard? Are we still welcoming any political dust or political microorganisms to soil our clean appearance and erode our healthy body? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making us, the living, feel sorrow. Are there any personal interests we cannot sacrifice, any mistakes we cannot abandon?" It is this thorough materialistic attitude that helped the Communist Party of China form and develop a set of effective guidelines and methods for criticism and self-criticism. They are the precious spiritual wealth of our party, and they effectively guarantee the thorough victory of the new democratic revolution from an organizational perspective. The presence or absence of serious criticism and self-criticism is an important indicator of a party member's party spirit. First of all, self-criticism is the foundation for internal party criticism: Our party is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the faithful representative of the interests of the Chinese ethnic groups. This determines all its actions and statements, which must be highly responsible to the people and must not allow any special interests of its own to exist, let alone any shortcomings or mistakes that harm the people's interests. Therefore, our party solemnly declares to the broad masses of the people: adhere to what is good for the people's interests, correct what is wrong for the people's interests. This is also the starting point and foundation for our party to conduct self-criticism.
It is precisely because self-criticism is based on the interests of the people that its smooth implementation is the foundation for the healthy development of intra-party criticism.
Through self-criticism, party members can strengthen their self-cultivation and create favorable moral conditions for intra-party criticism.
The consciousness of self-criticism is based on correct self-evaluation. In order to make correct evaluations of oneself, one cannot do without cultivating one's own moral cultivation and moral judgment standards. Moral judgment, in simple terms, refers to a person judging others and evaluating the goodness or evil of one's own actions based on their own political and moral perspectives. This is a kind of rational and emotional power that comes from within, and it is a set of values formed by people's social status, level of education, and practical experience in transforming the objective world. The closer this set of values is to a scientific worldview, the more it can be integrated with the interests and emotions of the vast majority of people, and the more it can accurately distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. This enables conscious adherence to correct behavior, correction of mistakes, and the emergence of the internal demand for self-criticism. An individual's moral cultivation is the spiritual force that propels self-criticism and noble moral power that drives people to take a positive and non-conservative attitude towards their own shortcomings and errors. This positive attitude will broaden one's spiritual realm and improve one's moral cultivation. A person with ideal goals and moral pursuits, in order to fulfill their responsibility for the interests of the people, cannot allow oneself to be complacent or stagnant. Therefore, the consciousness and initiative of self-criticism will inevitably be greatly enhanced.
Through self-criticism, the spirit of democracy within the Party can be promoted, and a good practical foundation for intra-party criticism can be created.
It is easy to listen to compliments but difficult to listen to differing opinions. It is easy to criticize others, but it is difficult to actively engage in self-criticism. This is a commonly occurring problem among party members and cadres. There are various reasons for the emergence of this problem, but fundamentally, the indifference to the spirit of democracy is an important aspect. Without a doubt, treating others as equals is an important principle for party members to handle their relationships with each other. Within our party, superiors and subordinates have a subordinate relationship in work, but in terms of adhering to the principles of democratic centralism and party discipline and law, they should be treated equally. However, some comrades, especially certain leading cadres, lack democratic concepts and act as if they were parents, exhibiting a rough style, often resorting to lecturing and failing to be objective when criticizing others or handling problems in a fair and just manner. The lack of an active and self-critical style is an important reason for the weakness of democratic consciousness. The practice of party construction tells us that in order to create a lively and relaxed development environment within the Party, we must open up channels for free expression by fostering a spirit of democracy and be willing to listen to various opinions with an open mind. When we make mistakes, we should not be stubborn. When others are correct, we should accept their opinions readily. Only in this way can we establish the correct relationship between the Party, the people, and the masses, truly create a positive and upward spiritual outlook within the Party, and promote the vigorous development of the revolutionary cause.
Through self-criticism, party unity can be promoted, and a favorable organizational atmosphere for intra-party criticism can be created.
To enhance the initiative and foresight in problem-solving, it is necessary to actively engage in self-criticism activities. This can be achieved through sincere communication and heart-to-heart conversations, with the aim of resolving conflicts, unifying thoughts, and fostering camaraderie among comrades. It is crucial to always prioritize people, respect them, understand them, and care for them. One should put oneself in others' shoes, treat others as equals, appeal to emotions, and persuade through reasoning, avoiding simplistic and coercive commands. By innovating content, format, and methods, one should address the hot and difficult issues in the ideological realm of Party members. In-depth exchange of opinions and thoughts should take place, with the goal of clarification, consensus building, emotional guidance, and conflict resolution. In summary, it is essential to fully recognize the challenges and complexities in the Party's construction and development under the new circumstances, and to create a harmonious atmosphere of unity and progress through high-quality self-criticism outcomes.
Furthermore, engaging in criticism is a political responsibility of Communist Party members. Comrades with experience in intra-Party activities often feel that although launching criticism activities may be easy to talk about, it is difficult to put them into practice. Engaging in criticism invariably entails exposing contradictions and touching upon sensitive issues. Hence, the prevalent situation within intra-Party life is one where there is "more planting of flowers and less planting of thorns." However, our Party's principles of Party conduct tell us that this attitude towards criticism is incorrect and un-Marxist.
Everything in the world is filled with contradictions, and all things progress and develop through the movement of their own contradictions. Our Party is no exception. If there are no ideological struggles and no endeavor to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will come to a halt. Engels stated long ago that it seems that any workers' political party in a major country can only develop through internal struggles, which is consistent with the general law of dialectical development. Recognizing contradictions, facing contradictions squarely, and handling and resolving contradictions correctly is the fundamental way to transform both the objective and subjective world using Marxism. From this perspective, the so-called attitude of "more planting of flowers and less planting of thorns" is tantamount to negating severe ideological struggles and advocating for the "peaceful coexistence" approach that abandons principles. It is an attitude that substitutes protecting the Party and people's interests with a "not offending others" mentality, and advocates for not criticizing, resisting, or fighting against wrong ideas and instead trivializing significant matters and magnifying trivial ones. All these are manifestations of losing the Party's character. Within intra-Party life, actively engaging in criticism activities and opposing the unprincipled peace that dismisses ideological struggles should be the political responsibility of every Party member.
Practice has proven that the political responsibility of engaging in intra-Party criticism is embodied in the efforts of Party members to adapt to the needs of Party construction and development, as well as in their correct treatment of comrades and themselves. It is also a process of receiving ideological training and education in communist thought.
Lastly, engaging in intra-Party criticism must follow the correct principles and methods. "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." This "tool" not only refers to instruments but also to methods. Once we possess a good style and effective instruments for criticism and self-criticism, we must not only dare to use them but also be adept at using them. Otherwise, not only will they be ineffective, they might even backfire. Only with the right principles and methods of using the tools can we achieve the intended goals of criticism and self-criticism.
First, we need to carefully summarize the experience and lessons learned from intra-party criticism. Our party is an armed Marxist political party organized according to the principle of democratic centralism and armed with advanced theories. Therefore, for a long period of time, we have been paying great attention to using criticism and self-criticism as weapons to strengthen the construction of the party's advanced nature. The practice of our party successfully leading the Chinese revolution fully proves that we are a party that is good at self-criticism, self-improvement, and self-improvement. We are a party that can rely on its own strength to discover and solve internal contradictions, correct its own mistakes, and address its own issues. In this historical process, we have accumulated extremely rich experience. The main manifestations are as follows: 
(1)starting from the overall situation of the cause, adopting a friendly attitude towards others, not arbitrarily labeling, not arbitrarily attacking, not arbitrarily picking quarrels, not excessively generalizing, forming a good atmosphere of speaking freely, expressing everything, speaking without guilt, and being willing to listen and learn.
(2) we need to use the correct means. In intra-party criticism, we should adopt a "gentle and considerate" approach, stay calm and composed, and absolutely avoid the wrong approach of "unmerciful struggle and ruthless repression" like the "left" sectarianism.
(3) we need to have the correct standards of right and wrong. The party charter, basic line, and policies should be taken as the standard of right and wrong. Criticism should focus on political and principled issues. We should not get involved in disputes without principles or be entangled in trivial matters.
(4) in conducting criticism and self-criticism, we also need to have a pragmatic attitude. We should speak with evidence, not speculate, exaggerate, or excessively generalize. We should persuade others with reason, not force. We should not focus on one point to the neglect of the rest. We must not fabricate accusations under the guise of criticism.
Secondly, we need to be pragmatic in our dealings with others and ourselves. Being pragmatic is the fundamental guiding principle and style of our party. It is also the basic leadership and working method of the party. When conducting criticism and self-criticism, we must pay attention to implementing the principle of being pragmatic. We must rely on facts, present evidence, and make rational arguments. We should not excessively generalize or fabricate unfounded claims.
To clarify the facts, we must acknowledge the existence when there is evidence, and recognize the absence when there is none. We cannot rely on subjective imagination, hearsay, or gossip. We should strongly discourage framing, false accusations, defamation, and baseless fabrications. We must always remember the importance of speaking with evidence and being politically cautious in our criticisms. Criticizing without evidence will only lead to suspicion and mistrust among comrades, causing unnecessary disputes within the party without principles.
We need to distinguish the nature and severity of the mistakes committed. We should neither exaggerate nor diminish them. We must not treat occasional errors as consistent patterns, or portray a local issue as a general problem, or turn intellectual and academic matters into political ones. And above all, we must not elevate issues to an extreme level or confuse the nature of contradictions. We should learn to evaluate and consider ourselves and others from a historical and dialectical viewpoint. We must not ignore achievements just because of mistakes, nor hide mistakes because of accomplishments. Regarding ourselves, we should not only recognize our strengths and virtues but also acknowledge our weaknesses and shortcomings. Only then can we humbly accept criticism from others. When dealing with others, we should not only focus on their weaknesses and flaws but also recognize their strengths and virtues. This way, we can objectively and dialectically evaluate a person without denying their correct proposals even when criticizing them. When criticizing comrades who have made mistakes, we should also affirm their strengths and virtues while pointing out their shortcomings and errors. This approach helps promote accomplishments, overcome shortcomings, and rectify mistakes. 
We should allow the criticized individuals to retain their opinions and provide explanations, defenses, or counter-criticisms. If the criticizers realize their criticisms were misplaced, they must promptly correct themselves and must not persist in their wrongdoings, as it would unjustifiably harm their comrades. Only by maintaining a responsible attitude towards oneself, others, and the party's cause, and steadfastly adhering to the principle of seeking truth from facts, can we create a constructive environment for criticism and self-criticism and truly achieve our original intentions and goals in utilizing this sharp ideological weapon.
Thirdly, we should start from the desire to care for, love, and help our comrades, focusing on understanding their thoughts and uniting their determination.
When engaging in criticism and self-criticism, we must always keep in mind the purpose of using this tool. The purpose is not to attack or undermine others, making it impossible for them to recover, but to help our comrades overcome their weaknesses and progress together, achieving unity and consolidation within the party at a higher level. Mao Zedong had profound insights on this matter. He pointed out, "In 1942, we concretized this democratic method of resolving contradictions within the people into a formula called 'unity-criticism-unity.' To be more specific, it means starting with the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle, and thus attaining new unity on a new basis." He believed that "here, starting with the desire for unity is of utmost importance. Without this subjective aspiration for unity, the struggle will undoubtedly lead to chaos and become unmanageable. How can we achieve party unity then? From this experience, we have found a formula: unity-criticism-unity. In other words, rectify mistakes with self-reflection, and treat illness to save people."Therefore, when conducting internal party criticism, we must always start from the desire for unity, and from the desire to care for and help comrades. Otherwise, it will violate the essence and requirements of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and inevitably go against the actual results and our initial intention.
Fourth, we need to stimulate the internal motivation of party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism.
Party members are the cells and the main actors of the party's body. Whether we can truly stimulate the internal motivation of the majority of party members fundamentally affects whether we can actively and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, our party emphasizes:We must make party members truly aware of the necessity and importance of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are sharp ideological weapons for strengthening the construction of the party's advanced nature. It is an excellent tradition and style that our party has continuously developed and always maintained. It is an important magic weapon for enhancing the vitality of the party. It is also a prominent symbol that distinguishes our party from any other political party. It is the character that a communist should have. Only when the majority of party members realize this, can we greatly improve their consciousness in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. We must make party members truly establish the correct principles of right and wrong, and consciously use these principles to evaluate their own thoughts and actions. The majority of party members and cadres should study Marxist theory seriously, consciously arm their minds with scientific theories. On this basis, we should strictly compare ourselves with the party member standards stipulated in the party constitution, conduct self-examination seriously, identify the gaps and outstanding issues, analyze and reflect on them from the depths of our thoughts. We should uphold truth over face, principles over relationships, and party nature over personal interests, promptly eliminate mistakes in their infancy, accumulate experience in distinguishing right from wrong, and improve our own ideological level and work ability. We should effectively play the exemplary role of party members, further improve the party's style, and raise the level of party's style construction to a new level.
We must learn to extract political nutrition from criticism. For us communists, criticism is like air, water, and sunlight, it is an essential element in our lives and the magic weapon to maintain our political youthfulness. It is unavoidable for a person to have shortcomings and make mistakes due to the inconsistency between subjectivity and objectivity in daily work, and one's self-awareness ability is also limited. No matter how strict one's self-examination is, it is not easy to see one's own shortcomings and inadequacies. Therefore, the majority of party members and leading cadres, can only make progress by sincerely accepting criticism from others and continuously drawing nutrition from it.
We must enhance the consciousness of party members as the main body. Party members are the main actors in all activities within the party. The formulation and implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies rely on the active participation of the majority of party members. The establishment and maintenance of the party's good image depends on the efforts of the majority of party members and grassroots party organizations. Therefore, the majority of party members must enhance their sense of pride and responsibility as Communist Party members, consciously use criticism and self-criticism as a sharp ideological weapon in their daily lives and work, through actively engaging in ideological struggles, sweeping away the dust on their thoughts, adhering to the good and correcting the wrong.
Fifth, we should actively use the form of heart-to-heart talks. Heart-to-heart talks have always been an effective method in the ideological and political work of the Communist Party of China, especially as an effective carrier for criticism and self-criticism. It has been proven that in conducting criticism and self-criticism, it often has effects that other methods do not possess. In heart-to-heart talks, everyone identifies the problems, communicates candidly, and collectively improves, which plays an important role in promoting close ties between the Party cadres and the masses, harmonizing the relationship between the Party and the people, and achieving unity of thinking among the cadre and the masses.
IV.The style of closely connecting with the masses. 
The style of closely connecting with the masses refers to the basic qualities and style that Communists should have in dealing with the issues concerning the people. In the long-term revolutionary struggle, our Party has formed a close connection with the people. This connection has withstood the test of various complex and dangerous situations and has become the source of strength and effective tool for our Party to overcome enemies in the cause of revolution and construction. The Marxist view of the masses is the theoretical basis for our Party to closely connect with the masses. Marx said that only with thoroughly scientific theories can the masses be convinced. Therefore, the primary issue in closely connecting the Party with the people is the correctness of the Party's theories. The Marxist view of the masses is the theoretical basis for our Party to closely connect with the masses. Is it the people who create history, or the heroes who create history? This is a fundamental divergence between historical materialism and historical idealism. Before the emergence of Marxism, almost all historians and philosophers advocated the view of heroism, believing that history is created by certain great individuals or a small group of elites. This is because they do not have a thorough understanding of the fundamental principle that social existence determines social consciousness. Therefore, they cannot have a correct understanding of the decisive role of the masses in history and cannot make a correct evaluation. They excessively exaggerate the role of a few outstanding individuals, heroes, emperors, and generals in history, believing that they are the masters of history, while the people are merely tools to be manipulated at will. The emergence of Marxism, for the first time, scientifically answered the basic question of the view of history from a philosophical perspective: it is not people's social consciousness that determines their social existence, but their social existence that determines their social consciousness. And the so-called social existence fundamentally refers to the mode of production of social material resources. The mode of production of material resources is the determining force of social development. In the mode of production, productivity is the most active and revolutionary factor. Therefore, productivity is the basis of human social existence and development, and the ultimate determining force of social development. Therefore, the history of human society is first and foremost the history of the production of material resources, and thus the history of the main body of material resources production - the people. All material civilization and spiritual civilization of human society are ultimately created by the people. The people are the determining force that propels historical development and the true masters of history. Of course, Marxism also recognizes the significant role played by individuals, especially outstanding figures in history. It believes that in the process of history, without outstanding thinkers, politicians, and military strategists to inspire the masses, organize the strength of the masses, guide the way forward, and lead the revolutionary struggle from the front, it would be impossible for the people to achieve victory. However, it also emphasizes that individuals are only ordinary individuals subordinate to the collective.The contradiction within the production mode caused by the development of productive forces, as well as various factors and objective conditions such as politics and economy, form the basis for great individuals to make achievements.
The Marxist principle that the people are the creators of history scientifically solves the relationship between the laws of social historical development and the practical activities of the people, and comprehensively summarizes the decisive role that the people play in the development of social history. It lays a solid theoretical foundation for the proletarian party to establish the perspective of the masses and formulate the correct party-building line. Based on this historical materialist principle, the revolutionary mentors of the proletariat always regard close connection with the masses as a fundamental principle in their struggle and practice of establishing the party. They emphasize that the party established by the working-class itself must always be a party closely connected with the masses, representing the fundamental interests of the people, and serving the interests of the majority. Marx and Engels clearly pointed out in "The Communist Manifesto": "Communists have no interests separate and apart from those of the whole proletariat."
In the practical struggle to lead the creation of the world's first proletarian dictatorship, Lenin further developed the Marxist perspective of the masses and put forward the idea of a new type of party, a party with a different nature. The party we need should be a party that truly connects with the masses, and is good at leading the masses. At the same time, Lenin believed that the power of the people is the source of victory. To achieve revolutionary victory, it is not only necessary to obtain the sympathy and support of the vast majority of workers, but also for the party to organize and lead the masses. Organizing millions of workers is the most favorable condition for revolution, and the most profound source of revolution's victory. The Bolshevik Party in the Soviet Union followed Lenin's teachings and carried out extensive work in organizing and mobilizing the masses, leading to the great victory of the October Revolution. After the victory of the October Revolution, the position of the party fundamentally changed, and the people truly became the masters of the country. Lenin believed that throughout the entire period of socialist construction, the laboring masses are the foundation of the entire national life and the fundamental guarantee of the Soviet Republic. The vigorous creativity of the masses is the basic element of the new society, and only when the people themselves participate in national construction can socialism be built. Therefore, for the ruling party, it is even more important to extensively connect with the masses, have faith in the masses, rely on the masses to consolidate political power, and carry out socialist construction. At the same time, Lenin also pointed out profoundly that one of the greatest and most serious dangers for the vanguard of the working class is to disconnect from the masses and develop bureaucracy. In order to prevent the occurrence of this phenomenon, it is necessary to strengthen party building, overcome mistakes in work, and always maintain a close connection with the people. In practice, many efforts have been made, not only emphasizing the need to respect the historical position of the people as masters, but also selecting outstanding workers and laborers to participate in the management of the country, and requiring party members and non-party members to supervise each other. It is precisely because of the efforts of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party that the close connection between the party and the people was guaranteed, and the young Soviet power was consolidated and achieved rapid development in a short period of time. Maintaining close connection with the masses is the political advantage of our party. The Communist Party of China was established under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist basic theory, educated and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It also grew and matured in close connection with the people, and in the common struggle with them. Chinese communists, represented by Mao Zedong, have not only cultivated unique fine traditions and styles for the Communist Party of China during their long-term practice of leading the Chinese revolution and construction, but also creatively put forward a line with Chinese communist characteristics, which is to be everything for the masses, rely on the masses, and go from the masses to the masses.
The theory of the mass line of the Communist Party of China began to take shape during the period of the land revolution and war. In September 1929, in the "Central Instruction Letter to the Front Committee of the Red Fourth Army," it elaborated on the relationship between the Red Army and the masses, emphasizing that "the work of the Party and the Red Army among the masses must definitely go through the mass line." This was the first time in the history of the Communist Party of China that the concept of the "mass line" was used. In 1933, Mao Zedong repeatedly expounded on the importance of caring for the interests of the masses and improving their lives in his "Preliminary Summary of the Land Inspection Movement" and some articles on economic work, emphasizing that Party and Soviet workers should face and deeply integrate with the masses. Only by patiently and arduously carrying out the work of mobilizing and winning over the masses can we gain the support of the majority of the people. During the period of the Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, our Party made a systematic summary of historical experience from a theoretical perspective and the experience of the mass line gradually took on a complete theoretical form. In 1942, Mao Zedong wrote "Several Issues on Leadership Methods," analyzing the entire process and various aspects of the correct leadership method of "coming from the masses, going to the masses," "unifying" and "persisting." At the same time, during this period, many mass viewpoints were proposed, such as the view that the masses are the true heroes, the view that seeking the interests of the masses is the starting point and destination of Communist Party members' revolution, the view that the opinions and experiences of the masses are the basis for formulating policies, the view that being responsible to the Party is consistent with being responsible to the people, the view of learning from the people, the view of serving the people wholeheartedly, and so on. 
In 1945, the 7th National Congress of the Party clearly incorporated the basic spirit of the mass line into the Party's constitution and regulations. In his report on the revision of the Party constitution, Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the Party's mass line "is our fundamental political line and organizational line," and elucidated the four elements contained in the mass viewpoint: everything for the people, taking full responsibility for the people, believing that the people can liberate themselves, and learning from the people. Who wins the people's hearts will win the world. During the period of the democratic revolution, our Party relied on the mass line to establish a close relationship with the people, allowing its own strength to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, overcoming the heavy oppression of domestic and foreign rulers, toppling three mountains, and achieving a thorough victory in the new democratic revolution, seizing nationwide political power. The key to the style of closely connecting with the masses lies within the Party's internal practice. In the contradiction between the Party and the masses, who is the main aspect of the contradiction? Our Party has pointed out that the key to closely connecting the Party and the masses lies within the Party, in the purity of the Party's organization and the Party's work. Our Party is the revolutionary leader and the embodiment of the people's interests. As long as the Party's line, principles, and policies can reflect the fundamental interests and demands of the people, the people will support the Party's leadership and follow the Party. On the contrary, if the Party's line, principles, and policies are incorrect and its work runs counter to the interests and demands of the masses, the people will alienate the Party and develop estrangement. Therefore, in the contradiction between the Party and the masses, the Party is the main aspect. Starting from improving the Party's organization and work, our Party has pointed out several principles and methods for closely connecting the Party and the masses, enriching the content of the excellent style of the Communist Party of China's close connection with the masses, and playing a tremendous role in guiding the construction of the Party. We must recognize the status and role of the people in history from the standpoint of the proletarian worldview in order to correctly position the relationship between the Party and the masses. "The people, only the people, are the driving force for creating world history." This is a profound explanation of the basic viewpoint of historical materialism by Mao Zedong. 
Zhu De also said, "Only the masses can create historical heroes."It is precisely based on the fundamental viewpoint of historical materialism that the party's mass line and basic mass viewpoint are formed. These viewpoints are: ①The viewpoint of everything for the people, wholeheartedly serving the people; ② The viewpoint of being responsible to the people, consistent with being responsible to their own leading bodies; ③ The viewpoint of believing that the masses can emancipate themselves and learning from the masses.
Only by scientifically understanding the historical status and role of the masses can these basic mass viewpoints be established, and it is possible to adjust the following relationships: ①The relationship between the party and the masses, that is, the party of the working class does not treat the people as tools, but consciously recognizes itself as the organization of the people to accomplish specific historical tasks in a specific historical period. Confirming this concept about the party means confirming that the party does not have a power beyond the people, and confirming that the party does not have the power to grant, dictate, and force the people. ② The relationship between individuals and the masses, that is, no one can detach themselves from the masses, otherwise they will achieve nothing. At the same time, all Communist Party members, regardless of their positions, are servants of the people. ③ The relationship between outstanding individuals and the masses, that is, outstanding individuals can only represent the fundamental interests of the masses and emerge from the struggles of the masses. They lead the masses and create history together with the masses. There will never be a person who can achieve everything and exclude the masses.
We must always remember that the fundamental purpose and entire task of the party is to serve the people with all our heart and soul. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental purpose and entire task of the party. Therefore, Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party "takes the greatest interest of the vast majority of the people of China as the starting point" and "all words and deeds of Communist Party members must be supported by and conform to the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people." Communists should "always consider the interests of the masses and put their interests first." They should "serve the people wholeheartedly and never detach themselves from the masses; start from the interests of the people rather than the interests of individuals or small groups." The interests of the people can be divided into partial interests and overall interests, immediate interests and long-term interests. Communists must not only consider the partial interests of the masses and neglect their overall interests, only care about the immediate interests of the masses and ignore their long-term interests, but should combine them and, when contradictions arise, make partial interests subordinate to overall interests, and immediate interests subordinate to long-term interests. If the party "cannot represent the greatest interest of the vast majority of the people at all times and under all circumstances, cannot timely put forth correct tasks, policies, and work styles, cannot adhere to the truth, and cannot correct mistakes promptly when they occur, then it will be divorced from the people". The reason why the Communist Party "has become the vanguard force and can lead the masses" is precisely because, and only because, it is the wholehearted and dedicated servant of the people, it reflects the interests and will of the people, and strives to help the people organize and fight for their own interests and will.
How can we truly serve the people with all our hearts and souls? Our party has summarized a series of discussions through long-term practice. 
(1) We must earnestly address policy and work style issues. The interests of the people are always reflected through the party's policies, and in order to formulate correct policies and implement them, we must also address work style issues. Mao Zedong regarded the party's policy as the "life" of the party, believing that "policy is the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party, and it is manifested in the process and outcome of actions." The formulation of correct party policies must go through the process of "coming from the masses and going to the masses." Party policies must also be tested and proven correct or incorrect through the practice of the people.
Any correct policy is in line with the interests and demands of the local population at the time and place, and it is connected with the people. Otherwise, it is not in line with the interests and demands of the local population and is detached from them. In the process of implementing the party's policies and completing tasks, there are sometimes behaviors that violate the party's policies and discipline. These behaviors can cause dissatisfaction among the masses towards the party. Zhu De pointed out that if these violations of policies and discipline are not effectively overcome, it will seriously detach our party from the masses.
Regarding the issue of work style, only by promoting the correct work style and overcoming negative work styles can the connection between the party and the people be strengthened. The integration of theory with practice, close connection with the masses, criticism and self-criticism, these are the three excellent work styles that our party has developed in the long-term revolutionary practice. They reflect the party's worldview and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. They embody the scientific attitude of Communist Party members towards Marxist theory, the masses, and themselves, and they are also the fundamental guarantee for the development of the party and its cause. In the process of socialist modernization construction, we must continue to promote the party's three excellent work styles. In overcoming negative work styles, our party's leaders repeatedly emphasize the need to oppose dogmatism, empiricism, commandism, tailism, sectarianism, bureaucracy, subjectivism, formalism, and arrogant and self-righteous attitudes towards work. They believe that these problems are definitely unacceptable and must be corrected because they will inevitably harm the interests of the masses and detach from them.
(2) We must adhere to the "from the masses, to the masses" line of thinking.
To formulate correct policies and implement them correctly, it is necessary to establish close connections between the party and the people, and also to solve the issue of ideological orientation. In 1943, Mao Zedong systematically explained the methods and work approaches of the "from the masses, to the masses" line of thinking. He said, "In all of our practical work, every correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses. This means gathering scattered and unsystematic opinions from the masses (through research, turning them into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then going back to the masses to propagate and explain, turning them into the opinions of the masses, making the masses adhere to them, implementing them in action, and testing whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Then gather them from the masses again and persist in going back to the masses. Such an infinite loop makes it more correct, vivid, and rich each time. This is the Marxist theory of knowledge."
"From the masses, to the masses" includes several basic links: first is "coming from the masses." From the perspective of understanding, it means deeply engaging with the masses, immersing in reality, conducting thorough investigations, and thereby obtaining rich sensory understanding. It is also a process of understanding the emotions, will, desires, and experiences created by the masses. The people are the subject of understanding and transforming the world, and they have rich practical experience. If one does not deeply engage with the masses, investigate and understand their situation, and absorb their valuable experience, it will be impossible to come up with decisions and methods that are suitable for local characteristics and the wishes of the local people. In practical work, many of our cadres may subjectively want to serve the people well, but if they do not go deep into the masses to understand the situation and listen to opinions, they often end up doing a poor job, causing losses to the people. The fact is that anyone, regardless of who they are, if they do not deeply engage with reality, do not deeply engage with the masses, and do not sincerely listen to the opinions of the masses, they will inevitably make major mistakes.
The second point is to "gather the opinions of the masses". This refers to analyzing and organizing the intuitive understanding that comes from the masses, turning it into systematic and rational understanding, and forming the process of leadership decision-making and methods. The so-called "gathering" does not simply accumulate the opinions of the masses. It is necessary to use the fundamental viewpoints and methods of Marxism to sort out, analyze, discern, and summarize the dispersed opinions and experiences of the masses, so as to make them into a systematic and scientific proposition. Of course, sorting out, analyzing, discerning, and summarizing may also be prone to errors, but through continuous consultation with the masses and continuous research on their practices, errors can be reduced and mistakes can be detected and corrected in a timely manner. 
The third point is "going to the masses". This is the process of testing the propositions and policies gathered from the masses through their practices, and modifying, enriching, and improving them. "Going to the masses" not only involves propagating the party's principles and policies to the masses, allowing them to understand and implement them, but also involves collecting the experiences of the masses in implementing policies, examining and modifying the policies. Historical experience has shown that as long as the party's principles and policies incorporate the correct opinions of the masses, reflect the wishes and demands of the masses, and the party is good at thoroughly and meticulously explaining the correct principles and policies to the masses, the people will sincerely support and resolutely implement the party's principles and policies.
(3) Party members and cadres must strictly discipline themselves and set an example.
In the revolutionary struggle, Mao Zedong always emphasized the vanguard role and exemplary role of Communist Party members, which was very important. Zhou Enlai strictly disciplined himself and regarded "never isolating oneself from the masses, learning from the masses, and helping them" as his "code of conduct" and basic requirement for leaders. Chen Yun also repeatedly emphasized "never isolating oneself from the masses, learning from the masses", and "the party's style of work is a matter of life and death for the party". The reason is clear. The party sets an example for the whole society, and the party's leaders set an example for the entire party. If the party organization ignores the opinions and interests of the masses, how can it expect the masses to trust and love the leadership of such a party organization? If party leaders themselves do not strictly demand of themselves, do not abide by party disciplines and national laws, violate party principles, engage in factionalism, pursue special privileges, engage in extravagance and waste, use public resources for personal gain, do not share the hardships with the masses, do not practice hard work first and enjoy later, do not obey the decisions of the organization, do not accept the supervision of the masses, and even retaliate against those who criticize them, how can they expect to lead the masses in achieving revolutionary goals? Therefore, our party consistently emphasizes that party members and cadres should care about the sufferings of the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and especially, leaders should set an example, be honest in performing their official duties, and fight resolutely against all kinds of illegal and undisciplined behavior. From the above, it can be seen that the party needs to make efforts from many aspects to maintain close ties with the masses and avoid the danger of alienation. However, if we can achieve the above two basic aspects, that is, establish the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people and serve the people well and strive for their happiness, then the relationship between our party and the masses will inevitably become closer, and the masses will trust and support the party even more. The cause led by the party will be invincible.
Chapter V The Ideology of Party Leadership
I. The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution.
The fundamental reason why our party has been able to lead the Chinese revolution and construction to achieve continuous victories lies in the use of scientific theories as ideological weapons, exploring and gradually mastering the laws of modern social and historical development in China, and being able to represent the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in China. At the same time, it also lies in the ability to sum up leadership experience through the use of Marxist party doctrines, and gradually form its own leadership theory.
The ideological leadership of the party is the scientific worldview and methodology led by the proletariat, and it is a theoretical system with high creativity, distinct practicality, and class nature, with rich content and logical integrity.
The Chinese people's resistance struggle is extremely brave. In the history of modern China, in order to save the unprecedented serious national and social crisis, the Chinese people have carried out numerous determined struggles and countless intellectuals have explored the path of saving the country and the people. Each of these struggles and explorations has had a certain impact on pushing Chinese society towards progress, but each time the immediate outcome has been failure. The fact proves that the self-improvement movement and reformism that do not touch the feudal foundation, the old-style peasant wars, the democratic revolution led by the bourgeois revolutionaries, and various other schemes that blindly follow Western capitalism cannot fulfill the historical mission of saving the country and anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. China looks forward to new social forces searching for advanced theories to open up new revolutionary paths.
The historic mission of leading the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism, striving for national independence and people's liberation, and realizing the rejuvenation of China, fell on the Communist Party of China. After the Communist Party of China, as the vanguard of the working class, ascended to the political stage in China, the Chinese revolution entered the historical stage of the new democratic revolution. In the long struggle, the Communist Party of China has exerted its political advantages and organizational strengths, uniting and consolidating the Chinese people, who were seen as "disunited sand," into an unbeatable force. After 28 years of arduous and heroic struggle, especially through the Northern Expedition, the land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism was finally overthrown, and a great victory was achieved in the new democratic revolution. The long-cherished dream of the Chinese people to establish an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous new China has finally come true. China's great historical transformation from the most miserable situation to a bright future is entirely due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China. "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." This is the most basic and important conclusion drawn by the Chinese people based on the historical experience of the Chinese revolution in modern times, and it is the great truth confirmed by the Chinese people based on their own personal experience.
The leadership position of the Communist Party of China is not achieved solely by anyone's wish or will. After the 1911 Revolution overthrew feudal imperialism, for a long period of time in the first half of the 20th century, there were several choices for the establishment of a country in China, and various forces were fiercely fighting for it. One choice was represented first by the Beiyang warlords and later by the Kuomintang ruling group, implementing the dictatorship of the big landlords and bourgeoisie, continuing China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal path. Another choice was represented by certain moderate groups or individuals, envisioning the establishment of a bourgeois republic, leading China towards independent and capitalist development. The third choice was represented by the Communist Party of China, establishing a people's republic led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, moving from new democracy towards socialism. These three paths, or three options, have been repeatedly tested in the historical development of Chinese society. The result is that the first option was abandoned by the Chinese people, and the reactionary ruling forces representing this option were overthrown. The second option did not receive the approval of the Chinese people, and most of its representatives later acknowledged that this option cannot be achieved in China. Only the third option ultimately won the support of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, including the national bourgeoisie and their political representatives. The Chinese people accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China and accepting the transition from new democracy to socialism is a solemn historical choice.
The reason why the Chinese people accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China ultimately lies in the advanced nature of the Communist Party of China. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has represented the advanced productive forces in China and stepped onto the historical stage.The purpose of the party-led new democratic revolution is to oppose imperialism's plunder of China, eliminate the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, change the feudal comprador production relations, and change the decayed political superstructure built on this economic foundation, and establish a new political superstructure with people's democratic dictatorship as the core to fundamentally liberate the shackled productive forces. The Communist Party of China has been guided by the most advanced and scientific ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism from the beginning, and has combined it with the actual revolution in China, putting forward and developing advanced theories and advanced cultures that can greatly mobilize, inspire and guide the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China, as the political party of the most advanced class in China, represents not only the interests of the working class, but also the interests of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Throughout the period of the new democratic revolution, all the struggles carried out by the party are ultimately for the fundamental interests of the broadest people. The party not only puts forward a democratic revolutionary program against imperialism and feudalism, but also sets clear goals and political slogans at every stage of revolutionary development, laying a political foundation for uniting the people of the whole country to struggle together. The party calls on all party members to fear no sacrifice and fight bravely for the victory of the revolution. The majority of party members, with unlimited loyalty to the people and spirit of self-sacrifice, have created countless heroic achievements that are touching and tearful, establishing a glorious model of wholeheartedly working for the interests of the people in people's hearts, and the party has thus won the trust and support of the Chinese people. The party's theory, program, line, policy and all work during the period of the new democratic revolution show that the Communist Party of China deserves to stand in the forefront of the times, representing the fundamental interests of China's advanced productive forces, the direction of advanced culture and the broadest people, and tirelessly fighting and making the greatest sacrifices for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is precisely because of this advanced nature demonstrated by the party that the Chinese people have a profound understanding that the Communist Party of China is the faithful representative of their interests and will, and therefore voluntarily choose and accept the party's leadership and fight under the party's leadership to win the victory of the new democratic revolution. From this, it can be seen that the core position and leadership role of the Communist Party of China in the Chinese revolutionary cause have a profound foundation and cannot be shaken or changed by any force. 
The road taken by the Communist Party of China in leading the Chinese revolution has been extremely tortuous and difficult, and the Chinese people have paid a great price to win the victory of the revolution and social progress. In this process, the Communist Party of China has accumulated extremely rich experience. Mao Zedong pointed out when summing up the historical experience of the new democratic revolution: "A disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, employing the method of self-criticism, and linked to the masses; an army led by such a party; a united front of all revolutionary classes and revolutionary groups led by such a party - these three weapons of ours provide the guarantee for our victory over the enemy." "With the help of these three weapons, we have won basic victory." Marxism-Leninism, as the guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China, is a scientific theory and method that correctly understands objective reality and has a progressive theoretical character that keeps pace with the times. Its vitality lies in its close combination with social practice, which can provide people with the direction to recognize the truth and open up the path of progress. In the long and complex revolutionary struggle, Chinese Communists, with Mao Zedong as the main representative, overcame the erroneous tendencies prevalent within the party of mechanically applying Marxist-Leninist books and experiences from other countries. Through arduous exploration, they summed up extremely rich and creative revolutionary practical experience, realizing the first historic leap of combining the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with the actual Chinese revolution, and thus Mao Zedong Thought was formed. This theoretical achievement embodies not only the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, but also the outstanding ideas of the Chinese nation and the summary of the entire party's revolutionary practice.The party closely combines the tasks of national revolution and democratic revolution, establishes the theory and route of the new democratic revolution, and creates a revolutionary path with Chinese characteristics of surrounding the countryside and capturing political power by armed force. The formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted Marxism-Leninism in the land of China. Once this Chinese Marxism-Leninism is accepted and mastered by the Chinese people, it transforms into a great material force for revolution and transformation in Chinese society. The reason why the Communist Party of China can lead the Chinese revolution to victory is precisely because it adheres to the correct direction of integrating the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution, is able to grasp the changes in the objective situation and summarize the practical experience of the people, adheres to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and unwaveringly walks its own path. This is the most basic experience summarized from the history of the party.
The Communist Party of China is the faithful representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people. Adhering to the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, and always maintaining the flesh and blood connection with the masses, is the fundamental condition for the Communist Party of China to overcome various difficulties and dangers and achieve the victory of the new democratic revolution. In the struggle for national independence and people's liberation, the party always relies closely on the people, sincerely seeking the interests of the people. In all its activities, the party breathes the same air and shares the same fate as the people, always taking the expression of the will and interests of the people as the starting point and destination of all work, always drawing inexhaustible strength to advance the revolutionary cause from the wisdom and power of the people, gradually forming a set of mass line principles about believing in the people, relying on the people, coming from the people, and going to the people. The party uses this leadership method and working method of the mass line to ensure that the formulation and implementation of the party's program, line, policies, and strategies conform to the maximum extent to the requirements of the masses, obtain the support of the masses, and enable the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to continuously play out and improve. This is the important guarantee for the party's continuous victories.
The Communist Party of China must play the advanced role of a proletarian party, lead the people to achieve victory in the Chinese revolution, and also tightly rely on the party's political line, strengthen its own construction, and continuously enhance the party's creativity, cohesiveness, and combat effectiveness. The Communist Party of China is the product of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese workers' movement. The growth and strengthening of the working class are the fundamental conditions for the establishment of the party. However, under the social conditions in China, the vast majority of party members come from peasants and other workers, there are also many intellectuals, and there are also revolutionary activists from non-working class backgrounds. At the same time, the party has long been in the environment of rural revolutionary base areas. Based on these characteristics, the party regards its own construction as a great project, attaches great importance to ideological construction, organizational construction, and style construction of the party, and successfully solves the fundamental problem of maintaining the proletarian vanguard nature of the party and building a Marxist-Leninist party. Through regular ideological education, criticism, and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism, and through summarizing experience and rectifying the party, the party is able to overcome subjectivism, sectarianism, "left" and rightist errors in politics, and learn lessons and make progress from mistakes and failures, gradually becoming mature. In the long-term struggle, the party has cultivated and formed a fine style of linking theory with practice, closely connecting with the masses, and self-criticism, and regards these three major styles as distinctive marks that differentiate it from any other political party, emphasizing the important role of adhering to and carrying forward the party's fine style in realizing the party's political tasks. After being tempered by the flames of revolution for a long period of time, the party's organization has continuously developed and become stronger, from a party with just over five members initially, to a mass Marxist-Leninist party with more than 4.48 million members nationwide by September 1949. The Communist Party of China is the most advanced and powerful leading force to ensure the victory of the Chinese revolution.
II. Basic Conditions for Implementing Party Leadership
Liu Shaoqi pointed out: The party's mass line is the line that establishes the correct relationship between the party and the people. It is about leading the people with the correct attitude and methods. It is about establishing the correct relationship between the party's leading organs and leaders and the masses. This vividly points out the essence of Marxist leadership science. Marxists believe that only the people are the true heroes, and only they can liberate themselves. The responsibility and role of leaders can only be to understand the needs of the masses, harness the wisdom of the masses, propose slogans and plans that reflect the fundamental interests of the masses, inspire the consciousness of the masses and help them understand their own interests, guide the masses to organize and struggle for their own interests, and synthesize the experience of the masses' struggles, and channel their enthusiasm towards higher stages. In this process, the main force and foundation are the people, and the role of the leaders is both a teacher and a student. Moreover, if one does not first focus on and consistently act as a student of the masses, there is no qualification to be a teacher of the masses.
Proletarian leaders never regard the people as their own tools, but consciously consider themselves as tools for the people to accomplish their specific historical tasks. The ability to lead the masses depends entirely on serving the people wholeheartedly. Broadly speaking, it means serving the vast masses of the people; more directly, it means serving those who are being led. Leadership is service, which is the fundamental standpoint for the correct understanding and handling of the relationship between leadership and the masses by the proletariat. It is precisely from this standpoint that Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasizes that we must closely link concern for the people's livelihood with the realization of the party's political tasks, make providing visible material benefits to the people or at least not harming their interests as one of the fundamental conditions for leadership, and regard the interests that are in line with the greatest number of people and supported by the vast majority of the people as the highest criterion for all words and actions of Communist Party members.
Therefore, whether or not one can obtain the support of the masses and qualify for leadership first depends on solving ideological and conceptual problems. Only by standing firmly on the standpoint of the people's masses can policies, methods, and approaches that fundamentally represent the interests of the masses be generated. If one stands on the standpoint of individuals or small groups, treating the masses as tools for realizing individual or small group interests, one will ultimately stand in opposition to the masses and inevitably determine and adopt policies, methods, and approaches from the perspective of how to compel and control the masses. This is incompatible with the scientific nature of Marxist leadership. Our Party repeatedly emphasizes that such leaders will definitely be abandoned by the masses.
Leadership is premised on the possession of certain powers. In the practice of leading the people in revolutionary struggles, our Party points out that it is particularly important to truly clarify in theory, especially in terms of ideology, where power comes from. Exploiting class rulers either believe that power is God-given or believe that it is earned through "personal struggle," and always regard it as a privilege that completely belongs to themselves and stands above the masses. Under the guidance of this view of power, even the most enlightened political view is only advocating "being the masters for the people." The master is still himself, not the people. In contrast to this view of power, our Party believes that only the masses of the people are the true masters of society, and leaders are nothing more than servants who carry out tasks in accordance with the will of the people.The power in their hands is given by the people, not leaders making decisions for the people, but the people themselves being the masters of their own affairs. The obedience of the masses to power is precisely the obedience to their own collective will. If leaders violate the will of the people in exercising power, the people can withdraw and replace that power at any time. Under two different concepts of power, the application of power not only results in completely opposite outcomes for the interests of the masses, but also creates leaders with different positions, abilities, character, and style.
Who are the creators of history? Whom do they serve? Who does power belong to? In summary, it depends on who is the subject of history. The vast masses of the people represent the strength of the advanced productive forces and the historical direction of society. Therefore, only they are the subjects of history. Understanding this social and historical truth deeply, leaders will consciously place themselves in the position of public servants and diligently fulfill their responsibilities.
III. The basic laws of the leadership activities of the Party
Our Party takes the Marxist perspective of the masses as the theoretical basis, summarizes the experience of leading revolutionary struggles, and, from the standpoint of epistemology, analyzes the significance of implementing correct leadership. It emphasizes the need to adhere to the methods of "coming from the masses and going to the masses" and "centralizing and persisting" to avoid detachment from reality and the masses, overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism, fully tap and mobilize the consciousness, initiative, and creativity of the people, ensure that leadership makes correct decisions and smoothly implement them. The ideological foundation of this leadership approach is seeking truth from facts; the organizational guarantee is democratic centralism. The close combination of seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and democratic centralism reveals the essential characteristics of various leadership methods of the proletariat in the process of understanding and transforming the world, embodying the most fundamental laws of leadership.
Seeking truth from facts is the only correct ideological line that guides leaders in making scientific decisions and correcting mistakes. Our Party emphasizes that everything should be achieved based on seeking truth from facts, but it is also difficult to adhere to seeking truth from facts. The key to solving this problem lies in closely linking seeking truth from facts with the mass line, so that the two complement each other. Seeking truth from facts is a prerequisite for adhering to the mass line. When Mao Zedong addressed the issue of leadership methods, he first started with resolving the ideological approach of the leaders. He initially proposed that "the victory of the Chinese revolution depends on Chinese comrades understanding the Chinese situation", repeatedly emphasizing slogans such as "no investigation, no right to speak" and "without correct investigation, there is no right to speak", making seeking truth from facts and investigation and research the guiding principles of the ideological and practical actions of the entire party, realizing the first essential element for correct leadership. Seeking truth from facts must also be based on the mass line. The most basic channel for understanding reality is to conduct investigations among the masses. All true knowledge can only come from the masses engaged in various practical activities. If leaders do not humbly learn from the masses and personally go to the masses to conduct thorough investigations, but make decisions, express opinions, and solve problems based on presumptions, they are bound to make mistakes. Precisely because the connection with reality and the connection with the masses are so important and inseparable, in order to implement scientific leadership, one must start with understanding the practical activities of the masses. In 1930, Mao Zedong pointed out that without the practice of the masses, merely living in books would not only inevitably fall into opportunism or impulsive actions but also risk walking the path of counter-revolution.
The mass line is the fundamental guarantee for implementing leadership intentions. Correct decisions that come from the masses can only be realized by persisting among the masses. Without the close combination of leadership enthusiasm and mass enthusiasm, it is impossible to achieve anything significant. Therefore, believing in the masses and believing in the Party are the two inseparable fundamental principles that our Party and people have long adhered to, and they are the basic basis for doing well in leadership work. The more setbacks, pressure, and difficulties we encounter in our work, the more we need to emphasize these two principles. In the revolutionary practice, there have been cases where people believed in foreign forces more than they believed in their own Party and people, or they set the Party and the people against each other, resulting in disorder every time. Therefore, our Party emphasizes that leaders at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, work solidly, and implement the Party's line, principles, and policies. This is the correct approach to following the laws of leadership, improving leadership work, and raising the level of leadership.
Democratic centralism, as the fundamental organizational principle of the Party and the political system of the country, is the embodiment of the mass line in the Party's life and the national political life. The basic principles and system of democratic centralism, such as collective leadership and minority subordination to the majority, are all based on trust and reliance on the wisdom and strength of the masses. If the leader believes in himself more than he believes in the masses, he will tend towards personal dictatorship; if he believes in a minority of people around him more than he believes in the masses, it will lead to sectarianism. This will undermine democratic centralism and strike at the enthusiasm of the masses. Democratic centralism is also the organizational guarantee for adhering to the mass line as a leadership method. Coming from the masses, gathering the opinions of the masses can only be done by focusing on the majority's opinions in accordance with the principles and procedures of democratic centralism; going to the masses and putting the opinions into action requires a certain level of authority, which can only be established on the basis of democratic centralism. Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the work report of the 7th National Congress of the Party that democratic centralism is the organizational law of the Party, and the correct organizational line is the mass line. This profoundly explains that adhering to democratic centralism is an objective requirement of the law of leadership.
IV. The basic methods of the Party's leadership work
In the process of leading the people to fight for national liberation, our Party has deeply explored the laws of leadership work and initially formed an effective set of leadership methods.
First, leadership work should focus on the center while taking into account other aspects. The Party has different central tasks in different periods of historical development, and all Party work must revolve around this central task. Therefore, leaders of an area or a unit must position various tasks appropriately and carry them out in an orderly and rhythmic manner, like playing the piano.First of all, it is important to differentiate between central tasks and routine tasks. Central tasks and routine tasks are interconnected yet distinct from each other, with routine tasks serving as the foundation and central tasks driving routine tasks. While focusing on central tasks, one should also take care of routine tasks. Forgetting about routine tasks and lacking a grasp of the actual situation can lead to empty-headed politicians. On the other hand, if routine tasks are not combined with the party's central tasks, it can result in blind activism. Only by skillfully connecting routine tasks with the party's central tasks and goals for a certain period of time can one become a politically astute revolutionary and the party's leadership will also be effective. 
Secondly, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the overall and the local. Work should be centered around the central tasks and achieve consistency between the overall and the local. Leaders should be adept at distinguishing the urgency of tasks, the main and secondary work, and the central and routine tasks. It is important to ensure the focus while also taking care of other aspects, striving to achieve consistency between the local and the overall.Another key issue in leadership style is the correct handling of the relationship between superiors and subordinates. Our party emphasizes that superiors and subordinates should trust each other based on the maintenance of the party and the people's interests, which is an important condition for managing the superior-subordinate relationship well. While superiors lead subordinates, the fundamental attitude should be to help subordinates and absorb their experiences to improve leadership, which is crucial to managing the superior-subordinate relationship well. Building trust and mutual respect between superiors and subordinates depends on superiors being humble enough to learn from subordinates, absorb and summarize their experiences, while also enthusiastically assisting and stimulating their initiative and creativity, strengthening their dedication and sense of responsibility, and improving their policy awareness and work ability. Mao Zedong once said that the main responsibilities of leaders are to give ideas and use cadres. Chen Yun also pointed out that the leading organ determines the plans. The execution of plans and inspection work must be subjectively and objectively consistent. Only by conducting in-depth investigations and research, listening to the experiences and opinions of subordinates, and finally formulating resolutions or tasks can they be practical and withstand testing in practice. At the same time, superiors should help subordinates correctly implement resolutions or tasks and inspect the results of execution. Specific analysis and handling of new problems that arise in practical work should be conducted. Therefore, policy formulation and task assignment should be flexible, allowing subordinates to make decisions based on actual circumstances. After clarifying the work tasks, corresponding methods should be proposed, and concrete and practical guidance should be given to subordinates, ensuring the healthy and smooth completion of tasks. In the process of leadership and being led, our party emphasizes that superior leaders should be willing to criticize themselves and dare to take responsibility. This is an effective way to resolve conflicts and improve the relationship between superiors and subordinates.
Thirdly, fully mobilizing the masses is the key to carrying out all work. The masses are the foundation on which the party relies to exist, consolidate, and develop, and they are the sole source of the party's strength. At the same time, the party is the tool for the masses to carry out liberation struggles. Therefore, our party points out that party work should start from the problems that the masses urgently demand to solve. This is a key aspect of implementing effective leadership. Paying attention to the lives of the masses and their immediate interests is an important link in fully mobilizing the masses and achieving effective leadership of the party. Combining the party's slogans, propositions, and policies with the practical interests of the masses is a major aspect of the party's leadership.
Fourth, we must combine the specific situation and flexibly apply various working methods. To conscientiously implement the Party's line, principles, policies, and instructions from superiors, it is necessary to pay attention to leadership art and adopt flexible and diverse working methods according to the different circumstances in each locality. Chen Yun pointed out that all working methods must be determined according to the different situations in each place. General principles and methods can refer to various resolutions of the central government, but they must also be combined with the actual local conditions at the time to propose appropriate slogans and flexibly apply various working methods. It is the most basic ideological and working method that all Communist Party members must bear in mind to determine the work policy based on the actual situation. The implementation of the Party's line, principles, policies, and instructions from superiors must be combined with the actual situation. We must study new situations, solve new problems, summarize new experiences, open up new prospects, and creatively implement and implement the revolution and construction work in practical work to move it forward. Here, we must oppose two tendencies: one is to refuse to implement under the pretext of special circumstances, and the other is to blindly execute regardless of the actual local conditions. If we blindly mechanically apply the superior's resolutions or instructions without considering the actual local conditions, this is not a good working method, but a opposition to the superior's instructions. Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "Oppose Dogmatism" that blindly and completely implementing the superior's instructions without any objections on the surface is not truly implementing the superior's instructions, but a clever method of opposing or neglecting the superior's instructions.
V.The correct style of Party leadership
Leadership style is inherently linked to the nature of leadership and is the external manifestation of the leader's stance and understanding of the world. Mao Zedong specifically pointed out in the Seventh National Congress of the Party that it is a new working style of the Party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory that has emerged among the Chinese people. It is a significant feature that distinguishes communists from any other political party. Our Party emphasizes that in order to implement the correct leadership style, we must first pay attention to the difference from the leadership style of other classes, and must recognize that it is based on theoretical advancement and close contact with the masses. Our Party has pointed out that how to treat the masses is, for proletarian leaders, first and foremost a question of stance, purpose, and sentiment. With the attitude of genuinely treating oneself as an ordinary member of the masses, starting from the purpose of respecting and loving the masses, and wholeheartedly serving the people, a good style will be consciously formed and adhered to. Without achieving a fundamental transformation of worldview and stance, and focusing only on methods, it will only be possible to maintain a superficial relationship with the people. Once the consciousness of being an official overwhelms the concept of the masses, various erroneous styles that detach from the masses will inevitably arise and grow, and the image of the leader will change from being "a servant of the people" to "a bureaucrat", resulting in the loss of leadership authority and the difficulty of implementing effective leadership.
Theoretical integration with practice is the main manifestation of leaders overcoming subjectivism and adhering to the proletarian party spirit. It requires leaders to have a solid theoretical foundation and a real understanding of reality, and to adhere to the analysis of specific problems. It requires both practicality and correctness, striving to combine the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the spirit of superior instructions, with the specific local conditions and departmental realities, creatively solving problems. It requires the courage to think and act, to take paths that previous generations have not taken; but it also requires solid examination, constantly evaluating whether one's thoughts and actions conform to objective laws and can withstand the test of practice. Our Party has always emphasized that to achieve correct leadership, we must further develop this tradition...
Maintaining the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people is the source of wisdom and strength for proletarian leaders, and it is the fundamental guarantee for them to remain true to their role as "servants of the people." It requires leaders to constantly understand the will of the people, grasp their pulse, care about their sufferings, and learn from their experiences. In terms of ideology, leaders should stand at a higher standpoint, see farther, and timely propose tasks that meet the needs of the people and can be solved. In terms of action, leaders should always advance together with the majority of the people. When the majority of people become conscious, it is necessary to quickly and decisively organize mass actions; when the majority of people are not yet conscious, patience and the ability to inspire are required. In terms of style, leaders should be modest, cautious, and treat people equally. In terms of lifestyle, leaders should live a hard and simple life, and avoid being extravagant. In short, leaders should neither be detached from the people nor place themselves above the people.
Being courageous in conducting criticism and self-criticism, engaging in active ideological struggles, adhering to the truth, and correcting mistakes are important manifestations of solemn responsibility towards the masses. Our Party believes that for us Communists, working for the interests of the people and being cautious and modest, speaking the truth and not caring about face, dealing with the shortcomings and mistakes in our leadership work, whether they come from ourselves or other aspects, must all be subject to serious criticism and self-criticism with a genuine intent to make improvements, rather than perfunctory remarks. If one becomes arrogant and domineering, in order to save face, distorts the truth, or blames the responsibility for failures and setbacks on the led, complains about the backwardness of the masses, or even insists on mistakes and acts in a stubborn manner, it will inevitably lose the trust of the masses and become isolated.
Establishment of the Guiding Position of Mao Zedong Thought
Section 1: The Party's Understanding and Acceptance of Mao Zedong Thought
I. The Introduction of the Concept of "Mao Zedong Thought"
At the beginning of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the guiding position of Marxism was established. The gradual integration of Marxism and the practice of the Chinese revolution gave rise to Marxism with Chinese characteristics. Because Mao Zedong was the main pioneer of the cause of the Sinicization of Marxism and the primary creator of the theory of Sinicized Marxism, Chinese Communists named this theoretical innovation with Chinese characteristics "Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought "was systematically summarized and extensively developed during the later stage of the land revolution and the period of the anti-Japanese war." The concept of "Mao Zedong Thought" is precisely the recognition and theoretical summarization of this historical fact.
Just as Mao Zedong Thought went through a long process of exploration from its conception to maturity, the concept of "Mao Zedong Thought" also went through a considerable period of time, from brewing to proposing and becoming the consensus of the whole Party. After Mao Zedong's leadership position within the Party was actually established at the Zunyi Conference in 1935, the Communist Party of China's ability to independently handle the problems of the Chinese revolution gradually strengthened. Around the time of the outbreak of the nationwide War of Resistance against Japan, the Party successfully transformed from a domestic revolutionary war to a nationwide anti-Japanese national war. Mao Zedong's leadership position was not only consolidated within the Communist Party of China but also recognized by the Communist International.
In September 1938, at the successive meetings of the Central Political Bureau and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party's Sixth Central Committee, Wang Jiaxiang, who had returned from Moscow, conveyed the opinions of the Communist International and Dimitrov affirming the correctness of the CCP's line and Mao Zedong's leadership position. The Communist International pointed out that since the start of the resistance against Japan, "the CCP's political line has been correct, and the CCP has truly applied Marxism-Leninism in a complex and difficult environment." It also specifically pointed out that the problems occurring within the leadership organs "should be resolved under the leadership of Mao Zedong, and there should be an atmosphere of close unity within the leadership organs." These opinions from the Communist International played a significant role in further promoting innovation, the use of Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution under Mao Zedong's leadership, and undoubtedly also promoted the party's attention and study on Mao Zedong's theoretical contributions.
Shortly after the publication of "On New Democracy," the term "Comrade Mao Zedong's theory" appeared within the Party. In early May 1940, at the opening ceremony of the "Zedong Youth Cadres School" in Yan'an, Wang Ming, who was then the Secretary of the Central Secretariat, was invited to deliver a lecture titled "Learning Mao Zedong," praising Mao Zedong as not only a "great political and military leader of the Chinese revolution" but also a "great theorist," calling for "learning Comrade Mao Zedong's life and work and his theory." He further elaborated on the "innovative spirit" displayed by Mao Zedong in the areas of "building Soviet political power," "building the Chinese Red Army," "creating revolutionary military strategies and tactics," "establishing a united front of the nation," and "building a new democratic political power." This was the earliest preliminary summary of Mao Zedong's theoretical contributions. Wang Ming especially mentioned "On New Democracy," stating that this work made new contributions to Marxist-Leninist theories about the state. Although Wang Ming's praise for Mao Zedong and his contributions may not have been sincere based on his later remarks and actions, given his academic background and position, this lecture still had a considerable influence.
The theoretical workers within the Party played an important role in promoting the study of Mao Zedong's theoretical contributions. In February 1940, Ai Siqi published an article stating that, based on practice, China had "produced some theoretical developments of Marxism, and therefore has its own Marxism." This statement played a leading role in proposing the concepts of "Sinicized Marxism" and "Mao Zedong Thought." From March 1941 to February 1942, Zhang Ruxin wrote several articles presenting a series of important views and judgments. He was the first to use concepts such as "Comrade Mao Zedong's thought," "Mao Zedong's theoretical and strategic system," and "Mao Zedongism," stating that Mao Zedong's speeches and writings were the "best embodiment of Sinicized Marxism," and that "Comrade Mao Zedong's theory is Chinese Marxist-Leninism." He argued for studying how Comrade Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese context and developed creative Marxism. He divided Mao Zedong's innovative contributions and developments of Marxism into four aspects: the nature of Chinese social class relations and the characteristics of the Chinese national democratic revolution, the united front of the nation, the political power of the Chinese national democratic revolution, and the construction of revolutionary armies and base areas as well as the strategies and tactics of revolutionary warfare. He also discussed them from three aspects: ideological perspective or methodology, political line or political science, and military line or military science. Deng Tuo, in an editorial written on July 1, 1942, for the "Jin-Cha-Ji Daily" commemorating "July 1st - the Party's study and mastery of Mao Zedongism," said, "In the Party's twenty-one years of struggle, it has made Marxism Leninism nationalized and Sinicized. The Sinicization of Marxism Leninism is Mao Zedongism." "Mao Zedongism is Chinese Marxist-Leninism. Every Chinese Marxist-Leninist must, in reality, be and also only be a Mao Zedongist..."The article, like Zhang Ruxin's writings, divides Mao Zedong's theoretical contributions into three aspects: scientific ideological methods, political science theories, and military science theories and strategies. It emphasizes, "The essence of Marxist concreteization, nationalization, and sinicization is the characteristic of Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological methods." Afterwards, Deng Tuo also used the term "Comrade Mao Zedong's theory." In addition, in their works, Hu Qiaomu, Chen Boda, Tao Zhu, Lu Dingyi, and Hua Gang, use Mao Zedong's basic theoretical viewpoints and research methods to analyze and solve problems, which also reflects the recognition of Mao Zedong's contributions in the theoretical field from a different perspective.
With the development of the rectification movement, the whole Party has made further progress in understanding Mao Zedong's contributions to the cause of Marxist Chinese revolution. This is highlighted by the fact that many senior leaders have published articles expressing their views. On July 1, 1942, Zhu De used the concept of "Chinese Marxism" in his article "Commemorating the 21st Anniversary of the Party," stating, "Today, our Party has accumulated rich experiences in struggles, correctly grasped the theoretical principles of Marxism, and created a theory of Chinese Marxism to guide the Chinese Revolution through its practice."
On the same day, Chen Yi pointed out at the 21st anniversary celebration of the establishment of the New Fourth Army that Mao Zedong "advocated treating the Chinese Marxism issue with a scientific mind and scientific methods" and established a "correct ideological system." He summarized Mao Zedong's theories on the Chinese revolution into five aspects: the nature of Chinese society, revolutionary drive, future, and corresponding revolutionary strategies; the issue of organizing and leading the revolutionary war; the theory and construction of the Soviet regime; the issue of party building; and the correct ideological methods, treatment of Western academic studies, transformation of Chinese national traditions, and transformation of Chinese academic thoughts. In June 1943, Ren Bishi pointed out in his article that one essential reason why Mao Zedong was able to "concretize and sinicize Marxism" was his strong sense of the masses and his attitude of humbly learning from the masses. This is the greatest characteristic of Mao Zedong's ideological methods and working methods. When learning Marxism, it is particularly important to learn sinicized Marxism. On July 6, 1943, Liu Shaoqi used the concepts of "Comrade Mao Zedong's ideology" and "Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological system" in his article "Rectifying the Menshevik Thoughts within the Party." On July 8, 1943, Wang Jiaxiang published "The Chinese Communist Party and the Path to Chinese National Liberation", not only using the concept of "Mao Zedong Thought," which has since been consistently used, but also discussing the process of the growth, development, and maturity of Mao Zedong Thought, explicitly stating, "Mao Zedong Thought is China's Marxism-Leninism, China's Bolshevism, China's Communism". It is the created Marxism-Leninism, and it is the development of Marxism-Leninism in China. On August 2, 1943, Zhou Enlai attended a welcoming evening party held by the Central Office and delivered a speech, pointing out that the 22-year history of the Party has demonstrated that "Comrade Mao Zedong's opinions have run through the entire history of the Party, developing into a line of sinicized Marxism. That is, the line of Chinese communism!" Communism has taken root in Chinese land through Mao Zedong's application and development. On November 10, 1943, Deng Xiaoping stated in his speech at the rectification mobilization meeting of the North Bureau Party School, "After the Zunyi Conference, the Party's cause was placed completely under the guidance of 'sinicized Marxism, namely, Mao Zedong Thought.'"
The above situation shows that, along with the continuous accumulation of revolutionary experiences and the publication of a series of important works by Mao Zedong, the development of the rectification movement throughout the Party, and especially the discussions among the Party's senior leaders on historical issues, the Party has not only reached a consensus on Mao Zedong's development of Marxism-Leninism but has also found a scientific expression to summarize the fruitful achievements of sinicized Marxism, which is "Mao Zedong Thought," and has made a preliminary summary of its basic content.There have been various terms used, such as "Comrade Mao Zedong's theory," "Comrade Mao Zedong's doctrine," and "Mao Zedong Thought." After a selection process, the Central Committee of the Party made a resolution on several historical issues and unified them during the 7th Party Congress. On April 20, 1945, the Resolution on Several Historical Issues (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution"), which was basically passed at the 7th Plenary Session of the Party's 6th Central Committee, was the theoretical outcome of senior leaders' discussions on the Party's historical issues during the rectification movement. It fully affirmed Mao Zedong's historical status and established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the whole Party.
The Resolution summarized the historical experience since the establishment of the Communist Party and made a summary of several major historical issues. It criticized the tendency within the Party during the period of the land revolution war that led to the dogmatization of Marxism, the sanctification of decisions made by the Communist International and the experience of the Soviet Union. It revealed the political, military, organizational, and ideological manifestations of various "Leftist" deviations and their social and ideological roots. At the same time, it highly appreciated Mao Zedong's outstanding contributions in solving the problems of the Chinese revolution using Marxist-Leninist principles and affirmed the significant importance of establishing Mao Zedong's leadership position throughout the Party. The draft of the Resolution, which was unanimously passed at the 7th Plenary Session of the Party's 6th Central Committee, stated, "The Party has produced its own leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and has formed a correct line of thought that is different from all erroneous lines and thoughts - the Mao Zedong Line and Mao Zedong Thought." This was the first time the concept of "Mao Zedong Thought" was officially used in the Party's documents. The Resolution elaborated on the basic content of Mao Zedong Thought from political, military, organizational, and ideological aspects, expounded on how Mao Zedong applied Marxist principles, perspectives, and methods, and put forward a set of theories, lines, principles, and policies that met the needs of the Chinese revolution. The Resolution emphasized that the Party's future tasks were to "unite all Party comrades like a harmonious family, like a solid steel, on the basis of consistency with Marxist-Leninist ideology, and strive for the complete victory of the war of resistance against Japan and the complete liberation of the Chinese people."
The convening of the 7th Plenary Session of the Party's 6th Central Committee and the passage of the Resolution marked the successful conclusion of the rectification movement and strengthened the unity of the entire Party based on Mao Zedong Thought. It also laid a solid foundation for the convening of the 7th Party Congress and the inclusion of Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology in the Party's constitution, preparing for ideological tasks.
The establishment of Mao Zedong Thought's guiding position was of special importance during the process of the sinicization of Marxism. On one hand, it pushed forward the Party's revolutionary theory for building a state; on the other hand, it provided a systematic summary of the achievements made in sinicizing Marxism and clearly defined the guiding position of Mao Zedong Thought.
Mao Zedong's written political report titled "On the United Front Government," his oral political report, and the conclusions he made for the meeting further enriched the theory of the new democratic revolution.
Firstly, he provided a comprehensive explanation of the general line of the new democratic revolution, which is "the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people." Mao Zedong said, "To summarize our line and program in one sentence, it is 'the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people.' This is the new democratic revolution. This line involves the issue of the army, the issue of the enemy, and the issue of the leader and commander of the army." He particularly emphasized the important position of peasants in the Chinese revolution, pointing out that peasants are "the most important part of the masses," the "main force of China's democratic revolution," and that "without peasants, there would be no democratic revolution in China; without China's democratic revolution, there would be no socialist revolution in China, and there would be no revolution at all." He said, "The proletariat should lead, mainly lead peasants."
Secondly, he further specified the political, economic, and cultural program of the new democratic revolution and added new content.Mao Zedong not only distinguished between the highest and lowest programs of the Party, but also differentiated between the general program and the specific program of the Party during the democratic revolution stage. The general program advocates for the establishment of a national system based on a democratic alliance of the absolute majority of the people, i.e. the "system of new democratic democracy". Under this national system, there will be the implementation of new democratic politics, new democratic economy, and new democratic culture. Among them, Mao Zedong specifically emphasized the issue of "broad development of capitalism". He explained that this report "differs from the New Democracy theory in that it determines the need for the broad development of capitalism, and takes anti-feudalism as the first priority".
"Why do communists not fear capitalism, but instead promote its development?" Because "replacing foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism with the development of capitalism is not only a progress, but also an inevitable process. It is not only beneficial to the bourgeoisie, but also beneficial to the proletariat. In present-day China, we have foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism, but we do not have enough domestic capitalism. On the contrary, our capitalism is too little". Of course, this "broad development" of capitalism refers to "capitalism that does not manipulate the livelihood of the people", it refers to "capitalism of the new democratic democracy". Mao Zedong pointed out that this proposition clearly distinguishes itself from "populism". As for the specific program, Mao Zedong listed 40 points, including: eliminating Japanese aggressors, not allowing mid-way compromise; abolishing the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang, establishing a democratic united government; implementing land reform, liberating farmers; developing industry, striving for China's industrialization and agricultural modernization; nurturing, uniting, and educating intellectuals, developing cultural and educational undertakings, etc. In order to develop industry, Mao Zedong also said: under the condition of obeying Chinese laws and benefiting the Chinese economy, foreign investment is welcome.
Thirdly, the viewpoint of evaluating the historical role of political parties based on the standard of productivity was put forward. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The good, bad, big, and small effects of the policies and practices of all political parties in China, as manifested among the Chinese people, ultimately depend on whether they are helpful to the development of the productivity of the Chinese people and the degree of help they provide. Do they restrict or liberate productivity?" The various programs of the Communist Party of China are all for the liberation and development of China's social productive forces, and to build China into an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous country, which is welcomed by the Chinese people.
In addition, in Mao Zedong's aforementioned political report, Zhu De's military report on the "Liberated Area Battlefield", Liu Shaoqi's report on "Amending the Party Constitution", and Zhou Enlai's "On the United Front" and other important speeches, there are full explanations on the Party's military line composed of the people's army, people's war, and the strategic tactics of people's war. They also emphasize the Party's line of prioritizing ideological and political construction, while also focusing on organizational construction, as well as the Party's mass line, good style, and the principle of democratic centralism. They also reflect the Party's experience and lessons in the issue of the united front since the period of the Great Revolution. The Seventh Congress of the Party added many new contents to the Marxist Chinese characteristics.
The Seventh Congress of the Party made a systematic summary of the fruitful results of the Marxist Chinese characteristics and formally established the guiding position of Mao Zedong Thought. This is an important aspect of the Seventh Congress to promote the cause of Marxist Chinese characteristics. The contribution of Liu Shaoqi's report is mainly reflected in the systematic and comprehensive summary and interpretation of Mao Zedong Thought, which represents the historical leap and achievements of the Marxist Chinese characteristics for the first time.
First, the report elaborates on the difficulty of Sinicizing Marxism and the reasons why Mao Zedong was able to successfully carry out this task. Liu Shaoqi pointed out that due to the unique development of Chinese society and history, as well as the underdeveloped state of Chinese science, it was a special and challenging endeavor to systematically Sinicize Marxism, transforming it from its European form to a Chinese form. This meant using the Marxist standpoint and methods to address various issues in modern Chinese revolution, including many problems that had never been raised or solved by foreign Marxists. Success in this endeavor could not be achieved simply through rote memorization and quoting Marxist works, but required a combination of a high scientific spirit and a high revolutionary spirit. It necessitated a rich understanding of history, society, revolutionary struggle, and an unwavering dedication to the cause of the people. One must be adept at applying Marxist methods to make precise scientific analyses of objective situations and be skilled at consolidating the experiences, will, and thoughts of the masses and applying them back to the masses. Only in this way could one integrate Marxism with the actual conditions of China, make independent and brilliant contributions to Marxism, and express them in the form of Chinese language to become a weapon guiding the Chinese people's fight. Liu Shaoqi concludes that it was Comrade Mao Zedong who successfully carried out this difficult task of Sinicizing Marxism. The reason is that Mao Zedong was not only the greatest revolutionary and politician in Chinese history, but also the greatest theorist and scientist. He possessed the highest theoretical cultivation and the greatest courage in theory, daring to engage in bold theoretical innovations by abandoning certain outdated and unsuitable principles and conclusions from Marxist theory and replacing them with new principles and conclusions suitable for the specific Chinese context. Mao Zedong had all the necessary inner conditions for theoretical innovation, allowing him to succeed in the arduous task of Sinicizing Marxism.
Second, the report defines Mao Zedong Thought from multiple perspectives, revealing its rich connotations and essential characteristics. First, it defines Mao Zedong Thought in relation to Marxism, stating that it is the unity of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and it is the communism and Marxism of China. "It is something of China, and it is also the complete Marxism." Second, it defines Mao Zedong Thought based on the requirements of applying Marxism to the era and the nation, stating that it is the continued development of Marxism in the national democratic revolution of colonies, semi-colonies, and semi-feudal countries, and it is an excellent model of the nationalization of Marxism. Third, it defines Mao Zedong Thought based on its function in guiding the Chinese revolution, stating that it is the correct theory about the revolution and construction of our nation, and it is the only correct theory and policy for the Chinese proletariat and all laboring people to liberate themselves. Fourth, it defines Mao Zedong Thought in the history of the Party's struggles over lines, stating that it not only grew and developed in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies but also emerged in the principled struggle against various erroneous opportunist ideas within the Party. "It is the only correct guiding ideology of our Party, the only correct general line." Liu Shaoqi also pointed out, "Countless historical facts have proven that when the revolution was guided by Comrade Mao Zedong and his thought, it succeeded and advanced, whereas when the revolution deviated from the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong and his thought, it failed and regressed." These statements by Liu Shaoqi conform to the objective laws of the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought, and they correctly explain the relationship between its individuality and commonality with Marxism, the relationship between learning and applying and innovative development, as well as its relationship with the progress and regression, success and failure of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Consequently, they also demonstrate the inevitability and necessity of establishing the guiding position of Mao Zedong Thought.
Third, the report summarizes the main content of Mao Zedong's ideological system. Liu Shaoqi pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought, as the complete theory of revolution and state-building for the Chinese people, "is reflected in the various works of Comrade Mao Zedong and many documents of the Party. It includes Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis of the modern world situation and China's national conditions, his theory and policies on new democracy, his theory and policies on liberating the peasants, his theory and policies on the revolutionary united front, his theory and policies on revolutionary warfare, his theory and policies on revolutionary base areas, his theory and policies on building a new democratic republic, his theory and policies on building the Party, and his theory and policies on culture." These theories and policies are "the highest expression of Chinese national wisdom and the highest generalization in theory." The report's nine aspects of summarizing Mao Zedong Thought constitute a New Democratic Theory system with Chinese characteristics, and answer a series of questions such as what kind of revolution China should carry out, how to carry out this revolution, and what kind of country should be established after the revolution. This is the most significant achievement of the first historical leap of Marxism's localization in China.
Fourth, the report calls for "launching a movement to study Mao Zedong Thought within the Party" and welcomes the "peak of Marxist culture." This is a call to further advance the cause of making Marxism Chinese.
Liu Shaoqi's scientifically reasoned exposition of Mao Zedong Thought is an important milestone in the history of the Chinese Communist Party's Marxist theoretical understanding and the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. If the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought reached the highest level of Marxism's localization in China at that time, then Liu Shaoqi's scientific elucidation of Mao Zedong Thought also reached the highest level of the Party's understanding of Mao Zedong Thought at that time. Although some expressions, formulations, and even analysis may not be very appropriate, his profound analysis and demonstration of logical force have made indispensable and unique contributions to establishing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding position of the Party and promoting the Party's better understanding and grasp of this theoretical system.
The general outline of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, passed at the Seventh National Congress, clearly states: "The Communist Party of China, taking the unified theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese Revolution - Mao Zedong Thought, as the guiding ideology for all its work, opposes any dogmatism or empiricism." This historical decision is the most authoritative confirmation of the great achievements of the first historical leap in the localization of Marxism in China.
It needs to be clarified that the naming of the Party's guiding ideology after Mao Zedong's name is closely related not only to the need of the Party's cause but also to the understanding of the relationship between "Mao Zedong Thought" and "Comrade Mao Zedong's thought." At that time, within the entire Party, including Liu Shaoqi's report, there was no distinction made between the two, which means that the relationship between personal creation and collective wisdom was not particularly noted, and "Mao Zedong Thought" was equated with "Comrade Mao Zedong's thought." However, it should be pointed out that Mao Zedong himself did not consider Mao Zedong Thought to be completely his personal creation. He explicitly expressed this understanding at the 6th Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee and the preparatory meeting for the Seventh National Congress. At the 7th Central Committee's Plenary Session, while explaining the draft resolution on historical issues, he pointed out, "The resolution attributes many good things to me, and I do not object to it, but this does not deny that I have shortcomings and mistakes; it is just that they were not included for the sake of the Party's interests." At the preparatory meeting for the Seventh National Congress, in his speech on the guidelines for the conference's work, he said, "The resolution attributes all the good things to me, so I have to express some opinions on this. If it is written as a representative, that would be acceptable, but if it's just me alone, it wouldn't be an embodiment of the Party." Furthermore, he also disagreed with being placed on par with the founders of Marxism-Leninism.In the process of the formation of "Mao Zedong Thought," Mao Zedong stated in a letter to He Kaifeng, the acting minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee: "I am conscious that my thoughts (Marxism-Leninism) have not yet matured and are still in the learning stage, not the stage of advocacy. If we need to advocate, we should do so with certain fragments (such as those in the rectification documents), not as a complete system, because my system has not yet matured." In August 1948, Wu Yuzhang, the president of Huabei University, telegraphed the central government, expressing his desire to propose "the main focus should be on studying Mao Zedong Thought" at the school's opening ceremony, and "to change Mao Zedong Thought to Mao Zedongism." Mao Zedong replied, "That is inappropriate. There is no Mao Zedongism now, so we cannot say Mao Zedongism. It is not 'the main focus should be on studying Mao Zedongism,' but it is necessary to call on students to study the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin and the experiences of the Chinese Revolution. Here the 'experiences of the Chinese Revolution' include some booklets written by Chinese Communists (including Mao Zedong) based on the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, as well as various documents and policies of the Party Central Committee. In addition, it is also wrong for some comrades to put my name alongside Marx, Engels, and Lenin in publications, saying 'Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao.' Both your statement and the latter one are unrealistic and harmful. We must firmly oppose such statements." At the 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee in March 1949, Mao Zedong once again emphasized that "Chinese Communists should not be put on par with Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." All of these statements indicate that Mao Zedong himself had a clear understanding of the term "Mao Zedong Thought."
Before and after the 7th National Congress of the Party, in order to meet the needs of the entire party in studying Mao Zedong Thought, a number of anti-Japanese base areas and liberated areas successively published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Before this, from 1927 to 1943, Mao Zedong's works had been published in various single volumes, special collections, and collections of essays. Some of his works were also included in the Party's internal literature collections "Since the Sixth National Congress," "Before the Sixth National Congress," and "Two Lines." This laid the foundation for the editing of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The first volume was edited and published by the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily Press in 1944, consisting of 5 volumes with a total of about 400,000 words, including 29 works by Mao Zedong, mainly from the period of the Anti-Japanese War. The "Jin-Cha-Ji Daily" stated in the publication announcement that the purpose of publishing this book was "to implement Mao Zedong Thought throughout the entire Party in the border areas." Only with the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought could the victory of the Chinese Revolution be achieved, so it was necessary for both party members and the general public to deeply study Mao Zedong Thought. Based on this collection, Dalian Mass Bookstore made some minor modifications and published a five-volume edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in 1946; the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau revised and published a sixth-volume edition and a supplementary edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in 1947. Afterward, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, under the name of the Northeast Bookstore, published a six-volume edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in 1948 (the hardcover edition was a combined six volumes). This was another significant collection of Mao Zedong's works and included 50 articles written by Mao Zedong from March 1927 to December 1947, totaling over 800,000 words. In addition to the aforementioned works, in anticipation of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the Su-Zhong Publisher published a one-volume edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." One noteworthy aspect of this edition is that it includes introductory remarks on Mao Zedong Thought by 8 individuals, such as Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Liu Shaoqi, and is titled "On Mao Zedong Thought," serving as the preface for the entire book. In 1948, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau of the CPC edited and published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as an "internal Party document," consisting of 61 articles written by Mao Zedong, divided into two volumes (Volume I: Period of the Great Revolution, Volume II: Period of the Civil War, Period since the Anti-Japanese War). The two volumes contain a total of over 900,000 words, making it the largest and most comprehensive collection of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" published before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The publication of various versions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" provided teaching materials for the study of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party, playing a positive role in the study and promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in various base areas and liberated areas.
Section 2: The Strategic Thinking of Transition from Rural to Urban Areas
II. Historical Conditions for the Proposal of the Strategic Thinking of Transition from Rural to Urban Areas
China's social and historical conditions determined that the New Democratic Revolution must take the path of surrounding the cities with the countryside. Timely achieving the transition from rural to urban areas is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the revolution through to the end and achieving and consolidating nationwide victory. In the second half of 1947, the Chinese People's Liberation War reached a turning point, and the People's Liberation Army launched a nationwide offensive, disrupting Chiang Kai-shek's plan to continue the war and completely destroy the liberated areas. Mao Zedong pointed out that this was a historical turning point, marking the transition of Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-year counter-revolutionary rule from development to elimination, as well as the transition of imperialist rule in China from development to elimination over the past hundred years. It was a great event. In October 1947, Mao Zedong solemnly issued the call to "overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and liberate the whole of China" in the "Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and pointed out deeply, "We are now shouldering the most important and glorious task in the history of our revolutionary movement. We must make active efforts to complete our task." It was precisely under these historical conditions that the Party Central Committee timely proposed to attach importance to and strengthen urban work, and initiated the problem of political and strategic transformation. Urban work became one of the important agendas of the Party Central Committee. In February 1948, the CPC Central Committee requested that "the party's attention should not be overly focused on war and rural work, but should be guided to urban work." In September, the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau clearly stated the need to "strengthen the management of cities and industry, and gradually shift the focus of the party's work from rural areas to cities." From the end of 1947 to the beginning of 1949, the CPC Central Committee issued multiple specific instructions on policy issues such as military control, organizing representative meetings of various sectors in cities, handling urban real estate, workers' wages, prices, factory resumption, and accepting educational institutions, indicating that the focus of the party's work had begun to shift from rural areas to cities. In March 1949, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC explicitly stated, "From 1927 until now, our work has been focused on rural areas, concentrating our strength in the countryside, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and then capturing the cities. The period of working in this way is now over. Now, the period of moving from the cities to the countryside and leading the countryside from the cities has begun... The party's focus of work must be placed in the cities. Great efforts must be made to learn how to manage and develop cities."
Faced with glorious historical tasks, the Communist Party of China once again advanced and developed the theory and practice of New Democratic Revolution with great theoretical courage and revolutionary spirit, and formed and developed the strategic thinking of transferring from rural to urban areas.
II. The Viewpoint of Recognizing Urban Work as the Central Work of the Party in a Timely Manner
Considering that cities have always been the center of imperialist and reactionary rule in China, the enemies who are unwilling to accept failure will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us in various ways. Mao Zedong particularly pointed out that after we enter the cities, we must learn to engage in political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie, and conduct diplomatic struggles against imperialists. In these urban struggles, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite other laboring masses, win over intellectuals, and strive to win as many nationalist bourgeoisie members and their representatives who can cooperate with us to stand on our side, or keep them neutral, so as to gradually overcome the enemy step by step. At the same time, Mao Zedong emphasized that great efforts must be made to learn how to manage and develop cities.From the first day we took over the city, our eyes are focused on the recovery and development of the city's production industry; all other work in the city revolves around this central task and serves this central task. Similarly, in all old liberated areas, the Party's central task is "mobilizing all forces to restore and develop the production industry, which is the focus of all work".
Under the guidance of the above strategies and policies, the Communist Party of China has elaborated on various strategic ideas for leading urban work. In the process of taking over the city, Liu Shaoqi pointed out that we must have a comprehensive view of urban and rural areas. In the past, we only had rural areas, but now we also have cities, which means we have new issues such as heavy industry, state-owned enterprises (of a socialist nature), state capitalism, and urban-rural relations. In order to lead the party's work with urban work at the center, we must consider and take care of these issues. The "one-at-a-time" approach must be changed, otherwise mistakes will be made. He believed that there are two problems that need to be solved in the takeover of cities: one is the issue of resuming private enterprises, and the other is the rapid arrangement and management of enterprises after takeover, so as to ensure normal production. The problem of urban management after takeover has not yet been basically resolved. After the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, everyone should strive to learn and solve it. If the takeover is done well, it also needs to be managed well and transformed. Some old things need to be eliminated, but not too much. New things need to grow. Building the city and developing production is the key. It brings workers and peasants closer together. The power to rely on in urban work is the working class. Liu Shaoqi emphasized: in the issue of managing the city, Chairman Mao Zedong proposed the question of who to rely on and what to do, and Chairman Mao's answer is to rely on the workers and develop production. The working class must be relied upon. But are the workers reliable? Marxism holds that the working class is the most reliable. This is a general statement. Specifically, there are still issues, so we must work hard to make the working class completely reliable. If we neglect to do our work and rely on them without making any efforts, it will not be reliable. Our party used to have a close connection with the workers, but later we were forced to turn to the countryside. The Kuomintang has been active among the workers for so many years, spreading influence, and the situation within the workers has also become complex; and our connection with the workers has weakened, and we are no longer familiar with the workers' situation. Therefore, we must strive to learn and always pay attention to Chairman Mao's instructions to rely on the workers, strengthen our work with the workers, and make them completely reliable. The main methods are three: to ensure the workers' living standards as much as possible and not let them fall too low; to educate the workers in depth and breadth; to organize the workers. Deng Zihui pointed out in response to certain erroneous tendencies that appeared during the early period of entering the cities: in the future, the center of work will shift to the cities, relying on the working class after entering the cities, and focusing on restoring and developing production. Chairman Mao's clear and affirmative proposal on these two issues is very necessary.Who to rely on after entering the city, with vague thoughts, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng first focus on the poor and laborers, forgetting about industrial workers. This is a common phenomenon, the thinking of relying on the working class is not clear. The center of urban work is to restore production, which I didn't understand before. I thought that production should be done after mobilizing the workers; if you don't solve the workers' living problems, how can you carry out workers' movements?
The most essential requirement of urban work is to promote China's industrialization, as Ren Bishi believed: "The focus of the entire party's work should shift from the countryside to the cities, which is a problem of historical significance." The so-called emphasis on cities essentially means relying on the working class to restore and develop industrial production, including light industry, heavy industry, transportation, etc., and organizing trade. All other work in the city, such as urban construction, mass movements, finance and banking, cultural education, party building, etc., should all be subordinate to the development of industry. In short, the key issue in urban work is to start industrialization. He clarifies the importance of achieving industrialization from three aspects: (1) the need to implement an independent and self-reliant policy. We have achieved independence and self-reliance politically and militarily, that is no longer a problem, but we must also achieve independence and self-reliance economically in order to be considered completely independent and self-reliant. That is to say, except for what China does not have in terms of resources, we can completely solve it on our own. We need a strong machinery manufacturing industry and a military manufacturing industry that can produce airplanes, tanks, warships, and so on. This way, we can achieve independence and self-reliance in national defense as well. (2) the need for the revolution to transition to socialism. Without the conditions of economic and industrial development, it is impossible to transition to socialism, which was also the mistake of past "leftist" errors. In the old China, the proportion of industry in the national economy was only about 10%. Ren Bishi believed that in order for the new China to gradually transition to socialism, the proportion of industry should be at least 30% or more. Therefore, even after the national revolution triumphed, we still need to have two or three Five-Year Plans in order to transition to socialism. (3) the need to consolidate the alliance between the workers and peasants. The alliance between workers and peasants, now and in the past, mainly manifests in giving land to peasants and freeing them from feudalism to achieve the alliance. In the future, in order to develop agriculture and improve the living standards of peasants, we need to provide them with affordable industrial products. At the same time, peasants need to supply the city with their own products in order to promote industrial development and improve the lives of workers. This is how we can consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants. In the future, industrial development will also need to provide tractors, combines, etc., to assist agriculture in moving towards collectivization. In return, agriculture needs to provide a large amount of grain and raw materials, as well as surplus agricultural products and labor, to support industrial development, promote foreign trade, and balance imports and exports. We must understand the mutually beneficial relationship between industry and agriculture. We need to cultivate a large number of urban workers, and realize the transition from rural to urban. At that time, there was a very prominent issue, which was where do a large number of cadres come from? Mao Zedong always attached importance to the cadre issue. Starting from early 1948, he repeatedly emphasized the importance of cadre recruitment among intellectuals, especially engineers, technicians, and employees with knowledge and experience. In the notice of the September Meeting, he proposed that cadre preparation should not only rely on the old liberated areas, but also pay attention to recruiting cadres from the major cities under Kuomintang rule, where there are many workers and intellectuals who can participate in our work. At the Seventh Plenary Session of the CCP's Second Central Committee, he further proposed that "we must prepare to transform the 2.1 million guerrillas into work units... we must consider the 2.1 million guerrillas as a huge cadre school". Zhu De also emphasized: in the past, the shift from cities to the countryside was a major transformation, and now the shift from the countryside to the cities is also a major transformation. Our work needs to adapt to this major transformation. The army needs to gradually transform from a combat unit to a work unit, which is also a major transformation.Our army is like a school that aims to cultivate capable individuals. In the future, they will be relied upon to manage production and engage in construction projects.
III. Proposing the "two must" tasks
Facing the transition from rural to urban areas and the test of wielding national power, the Communist Party of China has put forward a series of guidelines and policies to strengthen its own construction. It aims to strengthen discipline and improve the democratic life system within the Party. The Communist Party of China, based on Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and democratic centralism, was founded with strict organizational discipline from its inception. Due to the fact that the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army under its leadership were in a period of enemy division and guerrilla warfare in the past, local party organizations and military institutions were allowed to maintain considerable autonomy. This had a positive significance in terms of exerting the initiative and enthusiasm of local party organizations and armies, as well as overcoming prolonged and severe difficulties. However, it also led to undisciplined and anarchic situations, regionalism and guerrillaism. These erroneous tendencies developed further compared to the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and they harmed the revolutionary cause. This situation fundamentally cannot meet the needs of fully wielding political power. Therefore, the September Conference in 1948 profoundly expounded the importance of strengthening party construction under new historical conditions.
The September Conference believed that in order to adapt to the development needs of the current revolutionary situation, and to ensure complete unity of various policies implemented by the entire Party and the full implementation of military plans, the Party must make the greatest effort to overcome these erroneous tendencies and concentrate all possible and necessary powers in the hands of the central authorities and their representative bodies. Deng Xiaoping stated in his speech, "As the army advances and production grows, discipline must be strengthened." Strengthening discipline is extremely important as it is a crucial element in ensuring the success of the revolution. Moreover, strengthening discipline is connected to the development of democratic life within the Party. The key to resolving this issue lies with higher-level authorities, district Party committees, and senior Party cadres. Bo Yibo stated that strengthening discipline is a strategic issue, and the entire Party must fully recognize its importance and profound significance. Mao Zedong proposed that the central comrades should spare no effort in doing this. Within the third year of the war, the entire Party and army must overcome these erroneous tendencies in order to unite the people nationwide, rapidly expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism from China, and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The conference also pointed out that within our Party, due to the war environment or being in an underground situation, normal democratic life did not develop well. This situation persisted even after the Party's Seventh National Congress Party Charter stipulated the holding of various levels of Party representative congresses and representative conferences. At the same time, in order to adapt to the special environment and requirements of the past struggle, the normal democratic life within the Party had to be restricted to some extent. Serious incidents of bureaucratism, which resulted in detachment from the masses, occurred within Party organizations and government agencies. Erroneous propositions and improper sectarianism within the Party, as well as undisciplined conduct, were able to silently spread and grow, resulting in considerable losses to the Party and the cause of the people. The conference believed that as the revolution was about to achieve a nationwide victory, the situation required and provided conditions for changing the insufficient state of democratic life within the Party in the past period, in order to improve the Party's political quality and enhance its combat effectiveness.
Mao Zedong pointed out in the report: The method of implementing internal Party democracy is to implement the system of representative congresses and representative conferences. There is democracy within our Party, but it is still insufficient or lacking. Now we should increase it, and the method is to use representative congresses and representative conferences instead of cadres' meetings. The advantage of cadres' meetings is that they are quick, convenient, and relatively easy to convene. Representative conferences should retain the advantages of cadres' meetings, but should not be overly complicated. We must recognize that the theoretical level of our party is still low and must be improved.The party of such a large scale is either unaware or lacks consolidation on many fundamental theoretical issues, such as the classification of classes, which demonstrates the low level of theoretical understanding within our party. There are many intellectuals and workers and peasants within the party who are not knowledgeable about many basic concepts and are unable to explain many issues. There are millions of students and professors across the country, as well as many theater troupes. If you are unable to articulate a rational argument, you can only listen to others. We need to improve and popularize our theoretical understanding. Central Committee members and Political Bureau members should consider this issue as a political task; otherwise, they will not be able to convince those comrades who have made mistakes.
Ren Bishi said that during times of war, especially in areas directly engaged in combat, it is necessary to centralize leadership. Emphasizing unified leadership is correct. "In the liberated areas of North China, there is now relative peace. Both within and outside the party, there should be an emphasis on democracy and the establishment of a democratic system, which must be implemented." He pointed out, "There still exist phenomena within the party that suppress democracy, which arise from the conditions within the Chinese party. The management practices of the army have been applied within the party." In response to the existence of party members who hesitate to bypass their immediate superiors when expressing opinions and the occurrence of "rumors" among the masses, Ren Bishi pointed out, "The main cause is a lack of criticism and self-criticism, and a genuine lack of such will eliminate rumors." He believes that convening representative meetings and elections are forms of promoting democracy, but in essence, there must be criticism and self-criticism. "If there are only representative meetings and rumors cannot be openly discussed, then we only have the forms of democracy but not its essence." The role of democracy depends on long-term cultivation. "We must first have democracy within the party before the democracy of the people can truly be established." Ren Bishi emphasized that strengthening discipline is an objective requirement for the regularization of the army, concentrating forces for combat, and developing production after regional unity. More importantly, "As we move from rural to urban areas, we must place even greater emphasis on unity and discipline in order to avoid problems similar to Zhang Guozhe's. Furthermore, the further we advance and the more victorious we become, the more likely these problems and negative tendencies will arise." Otherwise, we will not be able to overcome the influence of the international and domestic bourgeoisie. He explicitly stated that the implementation of discipline is unconditional, but the cultivation of discipline is conditional. "There are two conditions for strengthening discipline: First, the entire party must have 500 cadres who understand Marxism-Leninism. When cadres master Marxism-Leninism, it can guarantee the unified implementation of policies. Many issues have been decided long ago, which were discussed during the 6th Party Congress, but have not been resolved properly. If each county committee has someone who understands the policy, the situation will be completely different. It is necessary to read those five Marxist-Leninist works, and the excuse of being too busy is unacceptable. Being busy can displace other things." "The second condition is to establish systems and formulate regulations, such as regulations for handling deserters and regulations for people's courts," "We need to have major laws and minor laws. Major laws govern minor laws, and the common people can also deliberate and formulate several conventions, but there must be unified laws. The military and government offices must also have systems that must be adhered to once established." Does compliance with discipline and emphasis on centralized unity weaken the enthusiasm and creativity of local areas? Ren Bishi answered, "Strengthening discipline does not by any means weaken the enthusiasm of local areas; instead, it eliminates blind and impulsive actions and encourages systematic and organized enthusiasm."
To this end, the conference also specifically discussed and passed the resolutions on "The Central Committee's System for Central Bureaus, Sub-Bureaus, Military Districts, Military Commission Branches, and Pre-Committee Reports to the Central Committee" and "The Communist Party of China Central Committee's Resolution on Convening Party Congresses and Delegate Conferences at All Levels." After the meeting, Mao Zedong drafted the decision on "Improving the Party Committee System" for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the face of great victory, we must adhere to the "two musts." At the January Politburo meeting, Mao Zedong proposed not to let victory cloud our minds. He said that victory can easily cloud our minds, especially today when victories are more likely. The greater the victory, the greater the burden, but unity is easier during times of tension and difficulty. We must be vigilant about this. We must educate cadres, especially senior cadres, to understand that the war is over and that the real work is just beginning, and it may feel easier to wage war during that time.
At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Mao Zedong once again cautioned the entire Party. Due to victory, there may be a growing sense of pride within the Party, a sense of being heroes and a reluctance to seek progress, a desire for pleasure and a refusal to return to a difficult life. Because of victory, the people will thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to support us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us; this has already been proven. However, the bourgeoisie's support may conquer those weak-willed individuals within our ranks. There may be some communists who have never been conquered by the enemy with guns, who have earned the title of heroes in front of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attacks of candy-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated bullets. We must guard against this situation.
Mao Zedong further pointed out, "Taking national victory is just the first step in completing the Long March. If this step is worth being proud of, it is relatively insignificant. What is worth being even prouder of is still to come. Looking back at the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution after several decades, it will feel like the short prologue of a long drama. A drama must start with a prologue, but the prologue is not the climax. China's revolution is great, but the journey after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now. Comrades must continue to maintain a humble, cautious, non-arrogant, and non-hasty style, and continue to maintain a style of hard struggle."
In the conclusion of the conference, Mao Zedong explicitly stated that it is forbidden to celebrate the birthdays of the Party's leaders, to use the names of Party leaders as place names, street names, or company names, and to maintain a style of hard struggle and to prevent the phenomenon of praising and eulogizing. The conference proposed the task of strengthening the construction of the ruling party. Ren Bishi, in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, proposed that with the shift in the focus of work, the construction of the Party should also adapt to it. He believed that after the failure of the great revolution, the Communist Party of China had long struggled in the countryside. Currently, 85% to 90% of the Party members are farmers. This is natural, but it is also a weakness, as it is prone to looseness and lack of discipline. After entering the cities, "if we do not have a Party base among the workers and cannot establish close ties with the working class, we cannot truly rely on the working class." Therefore, the main development target of the urban Party is industrial workers, followed by artisans and shop assistants, etc. If the development is too slow, it will be detrimental to our work.How to ensure the quality of party members? He proposed: First, strict examination. New party members should hold an induction ceremony, which "has educational significance for party members." Second, strengthen education and improve organizational life. Third, regularly check the work of party members, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strictly enforce discipline.
Ren Bishi cautioned party leaders at all levels and organizational departments: Strong cadres must always pay attention to party affairs. This includes branch construction, party leadership methods, work style, and the ideological dynamics of party members. "Being busy with various economic construction and administrative affairs, neglecting party construction and forgetting party affairs work is very dangerous." This is "particularly important for our party when it is about to become the ruling party nationwide."
IV. Develop production and unify fiscal work.
Regarding economic work, the September conference highlighted the development of production and the unification of finance and economics.
The phrase "production grows one inch" was discussed at the expanded meeting of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in Chengnanzhuang, and it was brought up again at this conference.
The meeting believed that restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production in the liberated areas was an important link in supporting the war and defeating the reactionary Kuomintang. On the one hand, it was necessary to ensure the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army in the Kuomintang's areas and obtain the manpower and material resources required for the war from the Kuomintang side and its controlled regions. On the other hand, it was necessary to make every effort to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production in the old liberated areas, so that it would grow to a certain extent beyond the existing level. Only when both of these tasks are completed can we ensure the overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; otherwise, it would be impossible.
Mao Zedong said, "If the army advances, we must make production grow one inch, otherwise we won't have food to eat." Ren Bishi said, "Now the economic burden on the people in our old liberated areas is heavy, especially with the additional burden of labor service. According to researchers in finance and economics, the burden should not exceed 20% of income (excluding indirect burdens), otherwise it would be very problematic to make production grow one inch."
In order to guarantee the army's advancement, Ren Bishi proposed that the old liberated areas should improve production and "make greater efforts and invest more capital under the condition of not exhausting their vitality." "In the Central Plains region, we should mobilize the masses and generally carry out rent and interest reduction, so as to support the troops advancing into the Jiangnan region in the fourth and fifth years of the war and become their rear support."
The conference believed that the restoration and development of production required good organizational work, effective leadership of the internal market and control of foreign trade in the liberated areas, and the resolution of problems such as the lack of certain machinery and raw materials, starting with solving transportation and repairing railways, highways, and waterways.We must oppose wastefulness and practice thrift: on the front lines, pay attention to capturing public goods, protect our own forces, take care of weapons, conserve ammunition, and protect prisoners of war; in the rear, reduce the expenses of state institutions, reduce the mobilization of manpower and animal power that is not urgently needed, reduce meeting times, pay attention to the agricultural seasons, not violate farming time, save the costs of industrial production, improve labor productivity, mobilize the whole party to learn how to manage industrial production, agricultural production, and business operations, and organize the economies of the liberated areas appropriately as much as possible, overcome the blindness in the market, and engage in necessary struggles against all speculative manipulators.
In the report, Mao Zedong raised the issue of economic and financial unification. He said, "The Finance Commission of the North China People's Government should unify the economic, financial, trade, banking, transportation, and military construction work and administrative work of North China, East China, and Northwest China, which are possible and necessary. Not everything should be unified, only what is possible and necessary should be unified, what is possible but unnecessary should not be unified, and what is necessary but not possible should also not be temporarily be unified. For example, agriculture and small handicrafts should not be unified temporarily, but financial work and currency issuance must be unified first. Administrative unification means that the Finance Commission of North China issues orders, and the Party, government, and military of the three regions should ensure the implementation of the unified orders of the Finance Commission of North China."
Section 3: Efforts to Uphold the Concept of New Democratic Society
I. Elaboration of the Ideology of New Democratic Society
Since the Chinese Communist Party put forward the basic idea of ​​a new democratic society, with the development of the victory of the democratic revolution and the continuous deepening of the party's understanding of this issue, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, it further enriched and developed the theory of new democratic society. This theory, together with the theory of new democratic revolution, constitutes a complete system of the theory of new democratic society. In the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party in 1925, it was pointed out: "After the victory of the national revolution, whether the proletarian revolution will continue and whether it must go through the bourgeois democratic system, depends on to what extent the proletarian revolution of the class can be achieved in the national revolution and the objective conditions of society at that time." In 1926, Stalin made a brief discussion on this issue in his speech at the Communist International China Committee. In his view, the future revolutionary regime in China will be "a dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry", and "this will be the direction China's revolution should take toward non-capitalist development or, more precisely, toward the development of socialism." Here, Stalin clearly proposed that the transformation of China's revolution from the democratic revolution to socialism needs to be carried out by a transitional regime. However, Stalin did not explain how this transitional regime should be realized. In the following two years, Cai Hesen also emphasized in his essay that the "dictatorship of the workers, peasants, and the masses" is an important factor in the future transformation of the revolution, and he called the worker and peasant regime "the lifting device of the transformation." He said that after the victory of the democratic revolution, the worker and peasant Soviet government should "confiscate all major foreign enterprises, and then confiscate all major domestic capitalist enterprises and organize and direct the country's economic life." It should "quickly prepare for the transition to the conditions of socialist revolution, that is, to replace the capitalist market economy with an organized national urban large-scale industry under the control of the rural collective economy." When history reaches this moment, "the initiation of socialism is initial." From Cai Hesen's discussion, it can be seen that the process of transforming the democratic revolution into socialism is not only the process of eliminating the capitalist economy, but also the process of forming a rural collective economy under the control of state-owned industries. In this discourse, Cai Hesen clearly expressed the main tasks of the transformation process. However, he is more focused on expounding the ideology of Marxism, and his understanding of the actual process of China's future transformation is not clear enough. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party was still in its infancy, and its understanding of many issues came from guidance from the Communist International. Furthermore, the new democratic revolution had just started, and the Chinese Communists lacked revolutionary practice and experience. Therefore, it was not possible to have a comprehensive understanding of how the transformation should be carried out.
After the failure of the Great Revolution, Chinese Communists began to shift their focus to the countryside, further integrating the Chinese revolution with China's national conditions, gradually clarifying the vision of transformation. In the 1930s, as the Chinese revolution deepened, the Soviet political power of workers and peasants was established in various base areas, with its economy mainly consisting of "state enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and private enterprises." At that time, the economic policy principle was to "concentrate economic strength for the supply of war, while striving to improve the lives of the people, consolidate the unity of workers and peasants in the economic field, ensure the leadership of the proletariat over the peasants, strive for the leadership of state-owned economy over private economy, and create the prerequisites for future development into socialism." In December 1935, Mao Zedong proposed in his report at the Yenan Forum to change the name of the Soviet Republic into the People's Republic to unite a greater majority of people. He pointed out, "The government of the People's Republic should be dominated by workers and peasants, while accommodating other anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces." He also specifically proposed protecting the development of national capitalist industry and commerce. These thoughts that emerged from the practice of the Chinese revolution became an important basis for the future vision of a new democratic society. In May 1939, Mao Zedong further discussed in the article "The May Fourth Movement," stating, "This democratic revolution aims to establish a social system in China that has never existed in Chinese history, namely, the social system of democracy. The predecessor of this society is the feudal society (which has become a semi-colonial semi-feudal society over the past century), and its successor is the socialist society. If a communist is asked why they need to first struggle to realize the social system of bourgeois democracy, and then go on to realize the social system of socialism, the answer is: follow the inevitable path of history." Here, Mao Zedong explicitly pointed out the existence of a transitional society in the process of transformation from a semi-colonial semi-feudal society to a socialist society, although the term "new democratic" was not directly mentioned in the text, its meaning was clear. After further theoretical exploration, in January 1940, Mao Zedong clearly put forward the concept of "new democratic society" in the article "On New Democracy." He stated that the first step and first phase of the Chinese revolution are to establish a new democratic society under the united dictatorship of various revolutionary classes with the Chinese proletariat as the leader, and "then, carry it to the second phase, the establishment of socialist society in China." He believed that in the new democratic society, the following policies should be adopted: politically, implementing a democratic republic under the united dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and all those against imperialism and feudalism; the form of state power in this country is the people's congress system, implementing democratic centralism; economically, bringing large banks, large industries, and large businesses under state ownership, allowing the existence of small and medium-sized capitalist industries and businesses, confiscating landlord's land and returning it to the peasants, implementing the principle of "land to the tiller"; and culturally, advocating the mass culture of the people against imperialism and feudalism. To summarize in Mao Zedong's own words, this means, "The overall outcome of the Chinese revolution is: on the one hand, the development of capitalist elements, and on the other hand, the development of socialist elements." Mao Zedong discussed the various forms of politics, economy, and culture in the new democratic society, and then said that the combination of politics, economy, and culture in the new democratic society is the new democratic society itself. In April 1945, in the report to the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong further explained the historical inevitability and necessity of establishing new democracy before socialism. He pointed out: "Our future goal is to move China towards socialist and communist society. But 'only after going through democracy can we reach socialism,' this is the natural law of Marxism." And in China, the struggle for the politics, economy, and culture of the new democratic society will still be long-term. Otherwise, "to want to establish socialism in the ruins of colonial and semi-colonial semi-feudal society is nothing but pure fantasy."
The reason is not because of anything else, but because "our capitalism is too little". Therefore, in the new democratic society, besides the state economy, the individual economy of the laboring people, and the cooperative economy, it is necessary to allow private capitalism to develop within the scope that cannot manipulate the country's economy and people's livelihood. This "is not only progress, but also an unavoidable process".
At the Second Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March 1949, although the direction of the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society was mentioned, it was only proposed as a future development prospect rather than an urgent task at the time. At this meeting, the establishment of a new democratic state after the revolutionary victory was still emphasized; after analyzing the status of China's economic composition at the time, the policies proposed were still new democratic policies. Mao Zedong pointed out at the meeting: "For a considerable period of time after the revolutionary victory, it is still necessary to as much as possible utilize the enthusiasm of urban and rural capitalism in order to promote the development of the national economy. During this period, all urban and rural capitalist elements that are not harmful but beneficial to the national economy should be allowed to exist and develop. This is not only inevitable, but also economically necessary", but we should adopt appropriate and flexible restrictive policies from all aspects. And it was pointed out that in such a new democratic country, there would exist major economic components such as state-owned economy of a socialist nature, cooperative economy of a semi-socialist nature, private capitalist economy, individual economy, and state-capitalism economy formed by the cooperation between the state and private capital. These economic components constitute the economic form of new democracy. In June of the same year, Mao Zedong emphasized again in the article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": it is necessary to make use of all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy, "Our current policy is to regulate capitalism, not to eliminate it." Before and after the establishment of New China, Liu Shaoqi also made many arguments in this regard. 
On May 29, 1949, Liu Shaoqi said at a cadre meeting in Beijing: our country's production is underdeveloped, mainly because there is too little capitalism. After the democratic revolution victories, it is inevitable to develop capitalism, but it must be limited while gradually developing. The transition to socialism will take place decades later, and it is difficult to talk specifically about it now, but it will definitely take a long time and not be short. Before the establishment of New China, when discussing the "Draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference", some democratic individuals proposed to include the future of socialism in China. Liu Shaoqi replied on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "We think this is not appropriate because it will still take a long time in China to adopt quite serious socialist steps in the future. To write this goal in the common program would easily confuse the practical steps we need to take today." Zhou Enlai also explained the reasons for not including the future of socialism in the common program in his report on the drafting process and characteristics of the common program. On June 23, 1950, Mao Zedong stated in his closing speech at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: the implementation of private ownership to state ownership and the socialization of agriculture "lies far into the future". "Our country is steadily advancing like this, going through war, going through the reform of the new democratic era, and in the future, when the national economy and cultural undertakings prosper, when various conditions are met, when the people of the whole country have matured in their thinking and when we all agree, we can calmly and properly enter a new era of socialism." How long this "far into the future" is, the Central Committee did not specify at that time.At a Politburo meeting in September 1948, Mao Zedong predicted: after the democratic revolution is victorious nationwide, it may take fifteen years before we can begin the offensive towards socialism. Ren Bishi stated in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee: "After the nationwide revolutionary victory, we still need to have two to three five-year plans before transitioning to socialism.During Liu Shaoqi's visit to the Soviet Union in 1949, he wrote in a letter, "It will take about fifteen years to build socialism." During the September political consultation conference, non-party members asked when China would achieve socialism. Mao Zedong replied, "Probably around twenty or thirty years!" In April 1950, Zhou Enlai told party members and leading cadres attending the United Front conference, "It will take about fifteen years to build socialism." It can be seen that the new democratic society established after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in China is not just a matter of a few years; it is a fairly long period of preparation for the transition to socialism. This is the consensus of the entire party. Liu Shaoqi referred to this period as the "stage of building new democracy." 
On March 28, 1951, Liu Shaoqi made a report at the First National Organizational Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, clearly stating, "The ultimate goal of the Communist Party of China is to achieve the communist system in China. It is currently struggling to consolidate the new democratic system and will struggle in the future to transition to the socialist system, and ultimately to achieve the communist system." On September 9 of the same year, the Resolution on Rectifying Party Grassroots Organizations, passed by the party's First National Organizational Work Conference, stipulated the standards for Communist Party members (the eight conditions of Communist Party members), with the second condition being: "The ultimate goal of the Communist Party of China is to achieve the communist system in China. It is currently struggling to consolidate the new democratic system and will struggle in the future for the nationalization of industry and the collectivization of agriculture, that is, to transition to the socialist system." The scientific conception of the Communist Party of China is to establish a new democratic society after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution. In this new democratic society, there is a stage of building new democracy and a transitional period. After the establishment of the new democratic society, new democratic construction is carried out. When considerable achievements are made in the construction of new democracy, and various material and spiritual conditions for the transition to socialism are fully in place, the transitional period begins, and the socialist revolution begins. In the transitional period, it is still a new democratic society with multiple economic components. However, at this time, the capitalist economy has transitioned from "allowing development" to "accepting transformation". The economic policy towards capitalism is no longer about utilization and limitation, but rather transformation and elimination. The peasants and artisans are guided towards collectivization. When these tasks are completed, the socialist society is born. The theory of new democratic society is the crystallization of the Communist Party of China's struggle experience and the great creation of leaders such as Mao Zedong. This theory, together with the theory of new democratic revolution, forms a complete system of theory for new democratic society.
The construction of the theory of people's democratic dictatorship generally includes the state system and the political power organization form, namely the nature of the state and the political structure. In political science, "nature of the state" refers to the class essence of the country, and the core issue is the positions of the various classes in the state."Political system" refers to the organizational form of a country's political power, that is, the ruling class chooses and adopts what kind of form to organize political institutions and implement its rule and management. The national system determines the political system and is reflected through the political system. The political system is adapted to the national system. Different classes' dictatorship leads to different national systems, and different countries have different historical conditions and traditions, resulting in different political systems, even for countries with the same national system, different political systems can be adopted.
The main content of the New Democratic politics includes the social foundation of the New Democratic state's political power and the national and political system of the New Democratic state.
Regarding the social foundation of the New Democratic state's political power, Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy" that the Chinese proletariat, peasants, intellectuals, and other petty-bourgeoisie are the fundamental forces determining the fate of the country. These classes, whether already awakened or awakening, are bound to become the basic components of the People's Republic of China's national and political structures, with the proletariat as the leading force. The People's Republic of China to be established can only be a democratic republic under the leadership of the proletariat, a united front of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people exercising joint dictatorship, which is the republican form of New Democracy. This kind of New Democratic republic is different from the old form of the bourgeoisie dictatorship, the European-American-style capitalist republic, which is the outdated old democratic republic. On the other hand, it is also different from the Soviet-style proletarian dictatorship, the socialist republic, which has flourished in the Soviet Union and is also to be established in all capitalist countries, undoubtedly becoming the ruling form of the national and political structures of all industrially advanced countries. However, this kind of republic, in a certain historical period, is not applicable to the revolution of colonial and semi-colonial countries. Therefore, the national form adopted by the revolution in all colonial and semi-colonial countries can only be the third form, which is called the New Democratic Republic. This is a transitional form for a specific historical period, so it is a necessary, non-negotiable form. Mao Zedong pointed out that among the various state systems in the world, when classified according to the class nature of their political power, there are basically three types: ① the bourgeois dictatorship of the republic; ② the proletarian dictatorship of the republic; ③ the united dictatorship of several revolutionary classes. The first kind is the state of old democracy. Today, after the outbreak of the Second World War, many capitalist countries have lost their democratic characteristics and have already transformed or are about to transform into bloody military dictatorships of the bourgeoisie. Certain countries with a joint dictatorship of landlords and bourgeoisie can be classified into this category. The second kind, apart from the Soviet Union, is brewing in capitalist countries. It will become the ruling form of the world for a certain period in the future. The third kind is the transition form of the revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The revolutions in various colonial and semi-colonial countries will inevitably have some different characteristics, but they are minor differences within the greater similarity. As long as it is a revolution in a colony or semi-colony, the basic composition of the state and political power will be essentially the same, that is, a new democratic state where several classes opposed to imperialism unite to exercise joint dictatorship. In today's China, this form of the new democratic state is the form of the Anti-Japanese United Front. It is anti-Japanese and against imperialism, and it is also a united front of several revolutionary classes.
In order to further clarify the connotation of the new democratic politics, Mao Zedong discussed the so-called national system issue. He said that this national system issue had been debated for decades since the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it still hadn't been clarified. In fact, it refers to the status of the various classes in society within the country. The bourgeoisie always hides their class status and uses the term "national" to achieve their actual class dictatorship. This concealment is of no benefit to the revolutionary people, and should be clearly pointed out. The term "national" can be used, but it does not include counterrevolutionaries and traitors. The dictatorship of the revolutionary classes against counterrevolutionary traitors is the kind of state we need now. "The so-called democratic rights system in modern countries often becomes a tool for the bourgeoisie to oppress the common people. If the Nationalist Party's democratic rights system is in place, it will be shared by the common people, not something enjoyed by a few." As for the so-called political system issue, it refers to the form of the political power structure, the form in which certain social classes organize their state power institutions to oppose the enemy and protect themselves. Without appropriate institutional forms of state power, the country cannot be represented. China can now adopt a system of the National People's Congress, the Provincial People's Congress, the County People's Congress, the District People's Congress, and the Township People's Congress, with the government elected by these levels of representative assemblies. However, it is necessary to implement a truly universal and equal election system that eliminates differences based on gender, belief, property, education, etc., in order to be suitable for the status of the revolutionary classes within the country, to reflect public opinion and direct the revolutionary struggle, and to be in line with the spirit of the new democratic politics. This system is called democratic centralism. Only a government based on democratic centralism can fully implement the will of all revolutionary people and effectively oppose the enemies of the revolution. The spirit of "something shared by the common people and not enjoyed by a few" must be reflected in the composition of the government and the military. If there is no genuine democratic system, this goal cannot be achieved, and it would be called a mismatch between the political system and the national system. Mao Zedong clearly pointed out that the national system refers to the united dictatorship of the revolutionary classes, while the political system refers to democratic centralism. This is the politics of the new democratic politics, the republic of the new democratic politics, the republic of the united front against Japanese aggression, and the republic of the Three Principles of the People's new democracy. This is the true "Republic of China". Although we have the name "Republic of China" now, we do not yet have the reality of the "Republic of China". To address this discrepancy, this is our work today. This is the internal political relationship that should be established and must be established in revolutionary China and anti-Japanese China. This is the only correct direction for the work of "building a nation" today.
In 1945, at the 7th National Congress of the Party, Mao Zedong further expounded on the politics of the new democratic politics. He said: After thoroughly defeating the Japanese invaders, we advocate the establishment of a national system based on the vast majority of the people and under the leadership of the working class, a democratic united front alliance. This is the system of the new democratic politics. The political organization of the new democratic regime should adopt democratic centralism, with the major policies decided by the people's congresses at all levels and government officials elected by them.This is a country system that truly meets the requirements of the majority of the Chinese population. In this country, there are still contradictions between different classes, each having different demands, such as the prominent contradiction between labor and capital. However, these contradictions and different demands can be reconciled and should not exceed common requirements throughout the entire stage of the new democratic revolution.
In December 1947, Mao Zedong clearly put forward the political program of new democratic revolution. He said, "Form a national united front comprising the oppressed classes, the people's organizations, the democratic parties, the minority nationalities, overseas Chinese and other patriotic elements, overthrow the dictatorial government of Chiang Kai-shek, and establish a democratic coalition government." This is the most basic political program of the People's Liberation Army and the Communist Party of China. In September 1948, Mao Zedong explicitly proposed in the report to the Central Political Bureau that in the future, it is necessary to "establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants", and said, "The class nature of our state power is as follows: led by the working class, based on an alliance of workers and peasants, with the participation of the democratic elements of the bourgeoisie in the people's democratic dictatorship." Soon after that, he issued the call to carry the revolution through to the end and explicitly proposed that after the revolutionary victory, a people's democratic dictatorship of the proletariat based on an alliance of workers and peasants as the main body should be established nationwide. On June 30, 1949, Mao Zedong published an article entitled "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", which demonstrated the historical inevitability of establishing a people's democratic dictatorship in China, clarified the basic tasks of the people's democratic dictatorship, the relationship between democracy and dictatorship, and the positions of various classes in the people's democratic dictatorship. Mao Zedong profoundly explained the historical inevitability of establishing a people's democratic dictatorship in China. The article summarized the positive and negative experiences of more than one hundred years of Chinese history, depicted the path taken by progressive Chinese seeking revolutionary truth since the Opium War, and illustrated that only Marxism-Leninism could serve as the guiding light of the Chinese revolution; only by implementing a people's democratic dictatorship could the Chinese people overthrow the three mountains and move towards socialism. Mao Zedong criticized the various proposals advocated by representatives of the bourgeoisie for a bourgeois republic, pointing out that "a bourgeois republic, which foreign countries have had, is not suitable for China because China is an oppressed country under imperialism." "To sum up our experience and focus it into one point: a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on an alliance of workers and peasants. This dictatorship must unite with the revolutionary forces internationally. This is our formula, our basic experience, and our main program." It clarifies the nature of new China and the positions and interrelationships of various classes in the state power of the country. Mao Zedong pointed out that the soon-to-be-born People's Republic of China is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class with an alliance of workers and peasants as its foundation. In China, at the present stage, the people include the working class, the peasant class, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. Among them, the working class is the leading force of the people's democratic dictatorship, because only the working class has the far-sightedness, selflessness, and revolutionary thoroughness. History has proven that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution fails, but with the leadership of the working class, the revolution succeeds. The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, primarily the alliance of workers and peasants. Because these two classes account for 80% to 90% of China's population, it is their power that primarily overthrows imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang and transforms society towards socialism. Furthermore, the people's democratic dictatorship also includes a special alliance between the proletariat and the national bourgeoisie. Mao Zedong pointed out, "To counter imperialist oppression and raise the backward economic status, China must utilize all city and countryside capitalist elements that are beneficial rather than harmful to the nation and people's livelihood, unite with the national bourgeoisie, and struggle together."
"Our current policy is to regulate capitalism, not to eliminate it". However, the national bourgeoisie cannot play the role of a revolutionary leader, nor should it occupy a major position in the state power. Mao Zedong explained the content of people's democratic dictatorship and the relationship between democracy and dictatorship, pointing out, "The combination of democracy within the people and dictatorship against the reactionaries is precisely the people's democratic dictatorship." This statement not only directly indicates the content of people's democracy and dictatorship against the enemy, but also in substance and in form.
Implementing democracy for the people means ensuring that the majority of the working people are in charge, fully enjoying various freedoms and democratic rights. In particular, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of workers to manage the state, enterprises, cultural education, etc. Within the people, work is conducted according to democratic principles, practicing democratic centralism. Contradictions within the people can only be resolved through democratic methods, educating and transforming oneself. Only in this way can the will, interests, and needs of the people be fully reflected, enabling the broad population to strengthen their sense of responsibility as masters and ensure the smooth progress of our cause.
Implementing dictatorship against the enemy means implementing dictatorship against those hostile elements, oppressing them, allowing only obedience, and prohibiting them from causing trouble. If they dare to cause trouble, they should be immediately banned and punished.
"Not doing so, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish." Of course, implementing dictatorship against the enemy does not mean suppressing and physically eliminating them all. After their political power is overthrown, as long as they do not rebel, do not cause destruction, and do not create chaos, they are granted land and work, allowing them to transform themselves through labor and become new people.
Mao Zedong pointed out that the relationship between democracy and dictatorship is one of combination, interaction, and indivisibility. Historical experience has proven that without people's democracy, dictatorship against the enemy is not possible, and without dictatorship against the enemy, people's democracy cannot be guaranteed. 
He proposed the basic tasks of people's democratic dictatorship:
First, it is necessary to strengthen the state apparatus, including the people's army, people's police, and people's courts, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the interests of the people. Internally, it suppresses the resistance of reactionary classes, and externally, it resists imperialist aggression and subversion. Second, it is necessary to solve the problem of national industrialization in a step-by-step manner.Learn to carry out economic work and undertake serious economic construction tasks. Third, transform the non-socialist economy and educate and transform the national bourgeoisie in order to achieve the nationalization of private enterprises in the future. Education and transformation of small-scale production, "the serious problem is the education of farmers", using long-term and meticulous work, implementing the socialization of agriculture, so that China steadily moves from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Fourth, engage in struggles against all old ideologies in political thought, educate and transform oneself, and transform the bad habits and ideas inherited from the old society towards the advancement of socialism and communism.
The people's democratic dictatorship is a new form of dictatorship with Chinese characteristics created by the Communist Party of China based on the state theory of Marxism and in conjunction with China's actual conditions. Compared with proletarian dictatorship, they have both similarities and significant differences. The similarities are: firstly, both are led by the proletariat and its political party; secondly, both are based on the alliance of workers and peasants; thirdly, both provide political guarantees for the development of socialism. The differences are: firstly, the scope of people's democracy is different. Under proletarian dictatorship, the people do not include the bourgeoisie; under the conditions of the people's democratic dictatorship, the people include not only the working class, the peasant class, and the petty bourgeoisie, but also the national bourgeoisie. Secondly, the objects of dictatorship are different. Under proletarian dictatorship, the bourgeoisie is the object of dictatorship; under the conditions of the people's democratic dictatorship, the national bourgeoisie is not the object of dictatorship, and the object of dictatorship is the reactionaries or enemies. With the basic completion of the socialist transformation in 1956, the bourgeoisie and the capitalist exploitation system no longer exist, and the socialist system is fully established. In essence, the people's democratic dictatorship in our country is proletarian dictatorship.
The theory of the people's democratic dictatorship is a combination of the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship with China's actual conditions. It is a great creation of the Communist Party of China and the people's leadership in long-term revolutionary and construction practice, and is the highest stage of development of the theory and program of new democratic politics. The people's democratic dictatorship in our country has gone through three stages of development: the period of the new democratic revolution, the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship in the revolutionary base areas, which is partial rather than national political power, and is the united dictatorship of various revolutionary classes led by the working class and its party, with the task of overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and solving the tasks of democratic revolution. From the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic dictatorship in our country has gone through two stages of development: the transitional period from new democratic to socialist society and the socialist period. Our party and Mao Zedong have repeatedly pointed out that the people's democratic dictatorship in these two stages is in essence proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, for a long period in our country, the two terms, people's democratic dictatorship and proletarian dictatorship, coexist and are interchangeably used. This is because both have the same basis in the leadership of the working class and its political party, the worker-peasant alliance as the class basis of state power, the historical mission to eliminate classes and achieve communism, and the basic aspects of the functions of the new democracy and the new type of state dictatorship. Lenin said, "All nations will inevitably move towards socialism, but the paths of all nations are not exactly the same, with their own characteristics in the form of democracy, in the type of proletarian dictatorship, and in the speed of socialist transformation in various aspects of social life. " The people's democratic dictatorship in our country is precisely a type of proletarian dictatorship that suits China's national conditions and revolutionary traditions. In connection with the above-mentioned characteristics of the theory of the people's democratic dictatorship, the formulation of the theory of the transformation from the new democratic society to the socialist society further enriches and improves the party's theory of new democratic political theory, making this theory a relatively complete system.
The theoretical content of the party's revolutionary transformation includes the following aspects: first, after China achieves victory in the democratic revolution, it must immediately transition to the socialist revolution. Mao Zedong pointed out that "the Chinese revolution includes two different stages: the bourgeois democratic nature of the revolution (the new democratic revolution) and the proletarian socialist nature of the revolution." The former stage is a necessary preparation for the latter stage, and the latter stage is the development result of the former stage. "The socialist revolution is the inevitable tendency of the democratic revolution." After the completion of the new democratic revolution, we must immediately and continuously transition to the socialist revolution. This is the law of development of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong also believed that favorable factors for future development towards socialism already existed in the new democratic country. These factors include: the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party of China in the new democratic society, the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance and including various democratic classes, the socialist state-owned economy and the semi-socialist cooperative economy, and the formation of the socialist state camp, which creates a favorable international environment. All these factors ensure that the final result of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution is the avoidance of capitalism and the realization of socialism. This idea of revolutionary transformation is a full embodiment of Marxist "theory of continuous revolution," clarifying both the current goals of the revolutionary struggle and preparing for future socialism.
Second, the transition from semi-colonial and semi-feudal society to socialist society in China cannot be direct and must go through an intermediate period, which is the new democratic society, and the state it should establish is the new democratic state. Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese new democratic revolution stage is an intermediate stage aimed at ending the semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and establishing the socialist society." The state to be established during this transitional stage can only be the New Democratic Republic. This kind of New Democratic Republic is the transitional form adopted by all revolutionary movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Any state established after the revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries can only take the form of the New Democratic Republic. Although the New Democratic Republic is only a form during a certain historical period, it is an "irreplaceable necessary form" for the transition to socialist society. Mao Zedong also pointed out that the transition period in China will be a relatively long historical stage. Although Mao Zedong did not specify the exact duration of this stage, his relevant statements indicate that it will be a considerable period of time. He said: "The first step of the Chinese revolution is the new democratic stage," and this "first step takes a fairly long time and cannot be achieved overnight." Therefore, during the transitional period, there will be a new form of state and power structure formed by several democratic class alliances in politics for a considerable period of time. In the economic aspect, for a considerable period of time after the victory of the revolution, it is necessary to make the best use of the initiative of urban and rural private capitalism to promote the development of the national economy. Liu Shaoqi also once said, "The time required for this transition will be much longer than that of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe and Central Europe." Based on the recognition of the prolonged nature of the transitional period, Mao Zedong also particularly emphasized the need to consolidate the new democratic state and the arduousness and long-term nature of the work to consolidate the new democratic state.
Thirdly, the new democratic state plays a very important role in the process of revolutionary transformation. Mao Zedong openly stated that after completing the task of the bourgeois democratic revolution in China, the Communist Party of China would be ready to transition to the socialist stage "when all necessary conditions are met." What are the conditions for this transformation? Mao Zedong believed that the new democratic state would play a crucial role in this process. He said: "In China, without a united new democratic state, without the development of the new democratic national economy, without the development of private capitalist economy and cooperative economy, without the development of a national scientific mass culture, which is the new democratic culture, and without the liberation and development of the individuality of tens of millions of people, in short, without a completely thorough democratic revolution of bourgeois nature led by the Communist Party, it is just pure fantasy to establish a socialist society on the ruins of a colonial and semi-colonial feudal society." Here, Mao Zedong proposed that the conditions for realizing the revolutionary transformation are: 1) a new democratic state power led by the proletariat and including all democratic classes; 2) the full development of the new democratic economy; 3) the full development of the new democratic cultural cause; 4) other necessary material preparations, and so on. These conditions can only gradually form within the new democratic state, demonstrating the position and important role of the new democratic state in the process of revolutionary transformation.
The theory of new democratic politics has laid the political foundation for the People's Republic of China. At the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in September 1949, the representatives formulated the "Common Program," which served as a temporary constitution, guided by the theory of new democratic politics. The "Common Program" stipulated that the nature of the People's Republic of China is "a new democratic, i.e. people's democratic, state." It "implements the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities in the country." It also established the appropriate organizational form of power in accordance with the nature of people's democratic dictatorship, namely the system of People's Congresses based on the principle of democratic centralism. "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at all levels and the people's governments at all levels," and "all levels of state power" shall implement democratic centralism. It also provided regulations on the forms of ownership in the new democratic state, stating that "the People's Republic of China must abolish all privileges of imperialist states in China, nationalize bureaucratic capital, gradually change the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership to peasant land ownership, protect the public property of the state and the property of cooperatives, protect the economic interests and private property of workers, peasants, small bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, develop the people's economy of the new democratic type, and steadily transform China from an agricultural country to an industrial country." Furthermore, it made provisions on military and diplomatic matters. All the specific contents related to the new democratic state mentioned above reflect the theory of new democratic politics.
III. Understanding and Application of the Theory of New Democratic Economy
During the period of the new democratic revolution, Chinese Communists combined the Marxist economic theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution, revealed the historical characteristics of the economic system in China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and put forward the requirements of developing the Chinese economy through the new democratic form, forming a basic program and a relatively complete theoretical form of new democratic socialism with Chinese characteristics. After 1949, China gradually transformed from a completely feudal society into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Mao Zedong analyzed that the result of imperialist aggression on China "on the one hand, led to the disintegration of Chinese feudal society and the emergence of capitalist elements, transforming it into a semi-feudal society; but on the other hand, they brutally ruled China, turning an independent China into a semi-colonial and colonial China." Here, Mao Zedong correctly pointed out that the economic form of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society was formed under imperialist aggression.Due to the invasion of capitalist imperialism, there have been significant changes in China's socio-economic structure: on the one hand, in the vast rural areas, the feudal economic structure with landlords owning most of the land is still maintained, but in the whole of China, the natural economy has disintegrated and a "semi-feudal and semi-capitalist" society has emerged. By the 1920s, capitalist production relations had developed and become the dominant economic relations in the national economy. This formed the economic basis of the new democratic revolution led by the proletariat but of a bourgeois-democratic nature. On the other hand, the so-called semi-colonial status refers to the political loss of sovereignty to foreign aggressors through wars, where the Chinese government is forced to cede territories and pay indemnities. More importantly, China is economically coerced into borrowing foreign loans, mortgaging customs duties, salt taxes, and various other means, leading to the loss of tariff autonomy. Moreover, foreign powers control China's economic lifelines through mining, railway construction, establishing factories and banks, thereby reducing China to a semi-colonial economic position. In the face of such a socio-economic structure, the Communist Party of China believes that the characteristics of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society are as follows:
1. In terms of production relations, while the self-sufficient natural economy of the feudal era has been destroyed, the feudal exploitation system rooted in the landlord class exploiting the peasants not only persists but also combines with comprador capitalism and usurious capitalism, enjoying a clear advantage in the socio-economic life of old China. Capitalism has developed and played a significant role in China's politics and culture, but its strength is weak. Imperialism manipulates China's finances and economy. Under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, the vast Chinese people, particularly the farmers, have become increasingly impoverished and even bankrupt, living in extreme poverty without political rights.
2. From the perspective of the level of productive forces and distribution characteristics, the productivity of old China's society is extremely backward, presenting a multi-tiered structure. The output value of modern industry accounts for only about 10% of the total national economic output, of which state monopoly capital (often referred to as bureaucratic capital) represents approximately 80% of the fixed assets of the national industry and transportation sector. Private capitalist industry ranks second in modern industry and cannot be ignored as a significant force. Industrial workers account for only 0.6% of the population, about 3 million people, with around 90% engaged in dispersed individual agricultural and handicraft economies, which are backward and not much different from ancient times. Mao Zedong said that this state of productive forces is "the result of imperialist and feudal oppression in China, the economic manifestation of old China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal social nature". The basic characteristic of industrial distribution is concentrated in the Northeast and six coastal provinces. These two regions account for 18% of the national land area, 42% of the population, and about 80% of the industrial output value in the country. The industrial output value of Shanghai alone accounts for over 25% of the total national industrial output value. Mao Zedong pointed out, "Our country's industries concentrated on the coast in the past...about 70% of our entire light industry and heavy industry are on the coast, and only 30% are in the interior. This is a historically formed unreasonable situation." Economic development is extremely uneven, with "fragile capitalist economy and severe semi-feudal economy coexisting, modern cities and stagnant rural areas coexisting, millions of industrial workers and tens of millions of farmers and handicraft workers under the old system coexisting... several railways, ships, and roads coexist with bad paths that can only be traversed on foot and paths that are even difficult to traverse on foot." The analysis of China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure by the Communist Party of China forms the basis of the theory of New Democratic Economy. The practice of the New Democratic Economy began during the land revolution war and was fully expounded and practiced after the Anti-Japanese War.During the period of the land revolution war, the party realized the extreme importance of economic construction and clearly pointed out that the economic construction in the base areas serves the revolutionary war and should not engage in economic work separate from the war. However, it is necessary to ensure the material needs of the war and the sufficient supply of troops, which cannot be separated from economic construction. To this end, the party began to formulate a series of distinctive economic policy principles.
The party pointed out that our national economy is composed of military camp affairs, cooperative endeavors, and private endeavors. Currently, the state-owned economic undertakings are limited to a possible and necessary part, and state-owned industries and commerce are also beginning to develop. Although they currently account for a small proportion, their prospects are unlimited. As for private economy, as long as it does not go beyond the scope of government laws, it should not only be prevented but also promoted and rewarded because the development of private economy is required by the national interest. Although they currently have an absolute advantage, they will inevitably maintain this advantage for a considerable period of time. Therefore, the party has established the principles of its economic policy, which is to carry out all possible and necessary economic construction, concentrate resources to supply the war, strive to improve people's livelihood, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants in the economic field, ensure the proletarian leadership over the peasants, and strive for the leadership of state-owned economy over private economy, creating the prerequisites for future development into socialism. This is in line with the level of production development and the requirements for changes in the production relations in the base areas at that time. In 1935, the international and domestic situations changed and, in order to attract more people to participate in the national democratic revolution and to unite the front, Mao Zedong further demanded that the party clearly define its economic policies towards capitalism. In his article "On the Struggle Against Japanese Imperialist Strategy", he pointed out, "The People's Republic does not abolish non-imperialist, non-feudal private property during the period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, and it does not confiscate the national bourgeoisie's industry and commerce. On the contrary, it encourages the development of these industries and commerce," and "in the stage of democratic revolution, the class struggle between labor and capital has limitations." The Labor Law of the People's Republic protects the interests of workers but does not oppose national capitalists making money or the development of national industry and commerce because such development is not beneficial to imperialism but is beneficial to the Chinese people. The implementation of this economic policy can bring about political changes, expand the united front, and better fulfill political tasks.
Under the guidance of the above-mentioned economic policy principles, the party pointed out that the central tasks of the economic construction in the base areas are to develop agricultural production, industrial production, foreign trade, and cooperatives. Based on this foundation, the party proposed specific measures for economic construction. To develop agricultural production, it is necessary to solve the land problem, dismantle the solid foundation of feudal exploitation system and production relations, establish the ownership of land by farmers, and implement policies that encourage agricultural production. Only then can the enthusiasm of farmers for production be improved. Based on this, help farmers organize labor mutual aid societies, farming teams, and plowing and cattle cooperatives to solve the problem of insufficient labor and livestock. Mao Zedong emphasized that under the current conditions, agricultural production is the most important task of our economic construction work. At the same time, he criticized the previous policy of confiscating and redistributing land in a radical manner, believing that this had a negative impact on the middle class in the countryside and was not conducive to the development of our party's struggle in the countryside. Regarding the development of industrial production, Mao Zedong emphasized the need to systematically develop handicrafts and some industries, both for self-sufficiency and for export. Efforts were made to develop foreign trade, open up markets within and outside the red areas, and balance supply and demand. The party also attached great importance to the development of cooperative economy, believing that cooperative economy was the best economic form at that time considering the level of productivity. It, combined with state-owned economy, would become a tremendous force in the economic field after long-term development, gradually gaining relative advantages over private economy and becoming the leading position.
Of course, during this period, the party's exploration of the new democratic economic view was preliminary, and it was not mature or complete in theory. The scientific concept of "new democratic economy" had not been used, nor had the internal logic between the national economy and the special historical stage of new democraticism been clarified.
The leap in understanding of the new democratic economy came after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the war, Mao Zedong elaborated on the ideology of the new democratic economy in works such as "On China's Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "On New Democracy," "On Economic Problems and Fiscal Problems During the Resistance Against Japan," and "On the United Front Government," which marked the development of a complete system of the party's ideology on the new democratic economy.
The first aspect is the introduction of the concept of the "new democratic economy." After systematically analyzing the characteristics of China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the Party reaffirmed that the nature of the current stage of China's revolution is still bourgeois-democratic revolution. However, the bourgeois-democratic revolution in contemporary China is no longer the old-style general bourgeois-democratic revolution but a new-style special bourgeois-democratic revolution, namely the new democratic revolution. This revolution requires the establishment of a new democratic political, economic, and cultural system. Mao Zedong pointed out that the Communist Party has been striving for China's political, economic, and cultural revolution for many years with the aim of building a new society and a new nation for the Chinese people. "In China, to establish such a republic, it must be a new democratic one politically and economically." This is because economic issues manifest themselves in politics and culture. So, what is the content of the new democratic economic revolution? It is to "nationalize the large capital and major enterprises of imperialists and traitorous reactionaries, distribute land of the landlord class to the peasants, while preserving general private capitalist enterprises and not abolishing the economy of the rich peasants." This revolution, on the one hand, clears the way for capitalism and, on the other hand, creates material conditions for socialism.
The second aspect is that the construction of the new democratic economy must follow the path of "restricting capital" and "equal land rights." The development of the new democratic economy must be based on China's historical characteristics and economic conditions to formulate policies and explore the correct development path. China cannot simply copy the Soviet model of economic development, nor should it follow the capitalist economic forms of Europe and America. Instead, it should establish a new type of economic relationship. After emphasizing that large banks, industries, and commercial enterprises should be owned by the new democratic state, Mao Zedong quoted content from the Declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, which stated, "For enterprises owned by individuals or foreign nationals, if they have a monopolistic nature or are too large for individual efforts, such as banks, railways, and shipping, they should be operated and managed by the state, so as to prevent the private capitalist system from manipulating the livelihood of the people. This is the essence of capital control." He believed that this is the correct policy for the economic composition of the new democratic republic. Regarding the policy towards capitalist economy, Mao Zedong explicitly pointed out that after the victory of the new democratic revolution, due to the removal of obstacles to the development of capitalism, the capitalist economy will develop to a considerable degree in Chinese society, which is imaginable and not surprising, as China's economy is still very backward. Therefore, the criteria for confiscating capital are based on whether it can manipulate the national economy and people's livelihood. At the same time, it is necessary to encourage the development of state-owned and cooperative economies and gradually increase their proportion to provide economic guarantees to avoid the future development of capitalism. In rural areas, land should be confiscated from landlords and distributed to peasants with little or no land, and the principle of "land to the tiller" should be implemented. Feudal relations in rural areas should be eliminated, but the existence of a wealthy peasant economy should be permitted. This is the policy of "equal land rights." During the period of the new democratic revolution, it is generally not to establish socialist agriculture, but various forms of cooperative economy that develop based on the principle of land to the tiller also have socialist elements. The new production relations established on the principles of capital control and equal land rights are suitable for the level of development of social productive forces at that time, which is also a concentrated embodiment of the compatibility between Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Chinese Communist Party's program of New Democracy.
Thirdly, the basic policies and correct approaches for developing the new democratic economy. The new democratic economy should consist of state economy, private economy, and cooperative economy. Without the coordinated development of these three types of economy, it is impossible for the Chinese people to construct a socialist economy on the basis of semi-feudal and semi-colonial conditions. Therefore, the Party has formulated some specific policies for economic development. In terms of labor policy, it is necessary to appropriately improve the workers' living conditions and adopt a dual policy that does not hinder the legitimate development of capitalist economy, in order to coordinate labor-capital relations and promote economic development. In terms of land policy, it is necessary to continuously adjust it according to changes in the Party's central tasks at different periods. The policy shifted from "confiscating all land" during the ten-year civil war to a dual policy during the anti-Japanese war, which required landlords to reduce rent and interest, and farmers to pay rent and interest, playing a positive role in uniting landlords and wealthy peasants to participate in the anti-Japanese war. Regarding the policy towards private capitalism, Mao Zedong pointed out that state-owned economy and cooperative economy should be developed. However, in the current rural base areas, the main economic component is not state-owned but private. It is necessary to provide opportunities for the development of free capitalist economy in order to oppose Japanese imperialism and the semi-feudal system. This is the most revolutionary policy at present. The Communist Party openly declares its clear view on the economic revolution: "Some people do not understand why the Communists are not only unafraid of capitalism, but even advocate its development under certain conditions. Our answer is simple: to use certain development of capitalism to replace the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism is not only progress, but also an inevitable process. It is not only beneficial to the bourgeoisie, but also more beneficial to the proletariat, or to put it more precisely, it is more beneficial to the proletariat. In China today, there is not an increase in domestic capitalism; on the contrary, there is an increase in foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism. Our capitalism is actually insufficient." Under the special historical conditions of China and the system of new democracy, it is not to completely abolish private property, but to generally protect it. It is necessary to oppose capitalist thoughts within the Party, rather than oppose the capitalist component in the social economy. After 1940, various anti-Japanese base areas and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region entered the most difficult period. In order to overcome the difficulties, Mao Zedong made the development of the economy the top priority of the construction of the base areas and territories, believing that the anti-Japanese war is not only a political and military competition, but more importantly, an economic competition. He put forward the overall policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" as the guiding principle of our economic and financial work. The movement of large-scale production by the military and civilians was carried out, and the policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency was implemented. He proposed that the correct path for developing the economy is to overcome individual dispersed operations and gradually move towards collectivization, and the only way to achieve collectivization is through the form of cooperative organizations. Emphasis was placed on the need to develop heavy industry and light industry in order to create conditions for the transformation of an agricultural country into an industrial country. In particular, the introduction of the standard of social productive forces demonstrates its theoretical depth and exceptional wisdom. He said, "The policies and their implementation by all parties in China, the positive or negative effects, big or small, they have in the Chinese people's productivity ultimately depend on whether they are helpful and to what extent they are helpful in the development of China's productive forces, and whether they restrict productivity or liberate productivity." With the smooth development of the liberation war, the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution was only a matter of time. The Party conducted deeper and more systematic thinking on how to develop the new democratic economy after the revolutionary victory, and comprehensively expounded the program of the new democratic economy. 
After being tested through long-term revolutionary struggles and continuous summarization of experiences, Mao Zedong clearly proposed the three major economic programs of the new democratic revolution in 1947, which are: "Confiscate the land of the feudal class and return it to the peasants, confiscate the monopolistic capital led by Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu and transfer it to the state of the new democratic revolution, and protect national industry and commerce...".
First, the confiscation of feudal class land belongs to the farmers, is one of the central contents of the new democratic revolution and one of the basic economic principles of new democracy. The peasant issue is the fundamental issue of the Chinese revolution and the central issue in which the proletariat must exert its leadership. The primary issue of the peasant issue is the issue of land. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the landlord class used the feudal land system that cruelly exploited the farmers, severely hindering the development of rural productive forces, and it is one of the root causes of China's poverty and backwardness. Therefore, launching land reform among the poor and impoverished farmers, eliminating the feudal exploitation of the land system, and implementing the principle of "land belongs to the tiller" are major tasks of the new democratic revolution.
When the new historical stage arrived, the party highly affirmed the practical land policy and land distribution method formulated during the land revolution, namely: relying on the poor and hired farmers, uniting with the middle peasants, restraining the rich peasants, protecting small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses, eliminating the landlord class, and transforming the feudal land ownership into farmers' land ownership; on a village basis, distributing land on a per capita basis, adjusting according to the actual distribution ratio, and adjusting according to the soil fertility. The party also believed that during the Anti-Japanese War period, in order to adapt to the needs of unity and resistance against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party changed the policy of confiscating the land of the feudal landlord class and distributing it to the farmers to a policy of reducing rent and interest, which also made the party's land policy suitable for actual development. Based on the rich practice and accumulated thinking of two historical stages, on May 4, 1946, the Central Committee of the CPC issued the "Directives on the Land Question," also known as the "May Fourth Directives," which changed the rent reduction and interest reduction policy of the wartime period to the policy of confiscating the land of the landlord class and distributing it to the farmers, and implemented land reform in the liberated areas. In 1947, the National Land Conference adopted the outline of the land law in the history of the Communist Party of China - the "Outline of the Land Law of China," which clearly stipulated the abolition of the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system and the implementation of the land system of "land belongs to the tiller." At the Party's December meeting held the same year, Mao Zedong summarized the experience of land reform and pointed out the guiding principles of land reform: "Relying on the poor peasants, consolidate the united front with the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal systems of exploitation of the landlord class and the old rich peasants."At the same time, in response to the problems in the land reform, it emphasized two basic principles that must be taken into account: "First, the demands of the poor and hired farmers must be met. This is the most basic task of land reform; second, the middle peasants must be firmly united and their interests must not be harmed."
"In January 1948, in a speech at the expanded meeting of the Northwest Field Army's Preparatory Committee, Mao Zedong demanded that local democratic governments pay attention to the fact that in land reform, while the landlord class as a class should be eliminated, as individuals they should be protected. "Abolishing the private ownership of the landlord class does not mean that we do not want them as individuals anymore. The landlords and old rich peasants account for one-tenth of the rural population, totaling 36 million people nationwide. They are the labor force of society and a kind of wealth. We should give them a portion of land and property, let them participate in production, they can carry sedan chairs, produce grain, and pay public grain, which is beneficial to the country." Mao Zedong also pointed out that the purpose of fighting against Chiang Kai-shek and eliminating the landlord class is to destroy the feudal comprador's production relationships in the economy, to liberate the fettered productive forces. In the countryside, it means to liberate the peasants, break the feudal land ownership system, implement thorough land redistribution, transfer land ownership to the peasants, and enable the peasants to produce with peace of mind and improve agricultural methods."In April of the same year, Mao Zedong clearly and comprehensively defined the general guiding principles and policies of the party's land reform in his speech at the Jin-Sui Cadre Conference. These principles, guiding directions, and policies aim to "rely on the poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, gradually and selectively eliminate the feudal exploitation system, and develop agricultural production." They maximize the unity and support of all forces that can be united in the rural areas, represent the interests of the widest range of people in rural China, ensure the smooth progress of land reform, liberate and develop rural productive forces, consolidate the alliance between the workers and peasants, and lay the foundation and conditions for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the realization of national industrialization.
Secondly, the seizure of bureaucratic monopoly capital and its transfer to the ownership of the new democratic state is another important aspect of the economic program of new democracy. Bureaucratic capital, represented by the four major families of Chiang, Song, Chen, and Ma, formed during the later stage of the land revolution and reached its peak during the resistance against Japan. The Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital consists of two parts: one is state monopoly capital, which refers to the capital owned by the four major families representing the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie; the other is the private capital owned by the four major families and other bureaucrats and warlords. These two parts of capital monopolized the economic lifeline of the whole country, representing the reactionary production relations and posing serious obstacles to the economic and social development of China. The seizure of bureaucratic capital means the seizure of these two parts of capital.
The seizure of bureaucratic capital has a dual revolutionary nature: on the one hand, bureaucratic capital is a feudal and comprador state monopoly capitalism, which is the economic foundation of Kuomintang's rule. Opposing bureaucratic capital means opposing feudal and comprador capital and has the nature of a new democratic revolution; on the other hand, opposing bureaucratic capital means opposing the big bourgeoisie and concentrating this huge power that controls the national economy in the hands of the new democratic state, becoming the main source of the socialist state-owned economy, and creating conditions for socialist transformation. Therefore, the seizure of bureaucratic capital also has the nature of a socialist revolution.
During the Liberation War, the Communist Party of China started to seize bureaucratic capital from the already liberated cities in the Northeast; after the three major battles, it basically seized the bureaucratic capital enterprises north of the Yangtze River; by the end of 1949, all the bureaucratic capital enterprises on the mainland except Taiwan had been taken over by the people's government and became state-owned. Completing the revolutionary task of seizing bureaucratic capital is of great significance: firstly, by seizing the monopolistic bureaucratic capital, the new democratic state gained control of the country's economy and placed the state-owned economy in a leading position in the national economy; secondly, the proletariat can use the economic power transformed from bureaucratic capital to consolidate the new-born People's Republic of China; finally, it laid the foundation for the establishment of a new democratic society and its corresponding economic system and created a basis for the transition to socialism.
Thirdly, protecting national industry and commerce is a very distinctive component of the economic program of new democracy. As mentioned earlier, the Communist Party of China classifies Chinese capitalism into bureaucratic capitalism and national capitalism, and adopts completely different policies for each. A protective policy is implemented for national capitalism, which means allowing capitalist economy that does not manipulate national economy and people's livelihood to develop under the conditions of new democracy.
Due to our premature completion of the transition from new democracy to socialism in practical work, the premature transformation of national capitalism, and the sweeping criticism of capitalism, especially after the mid-1960s, which led to a series of "left" deviations and the mentality that Mao Zedong was always a "populist" or "utopianist" among some people...However, during the process of the New Democratic Revolution, especially in the disputes that arose after the Anti-Japanese War regarding the "1949 establishment of the country" issue, it was only the Chinese Communist Party, represented by Mao Zedong, that repeatedly declared, time and time again, that in the New Democratic society, not only should one not fear capitalism, but under certain conditions, one should also promote its development. Various forms of the bourgeoisie did not dare to put forward the proposition of developing capitalism. Only the Chinese Communist Party presented the protection of national industry and commerce and the development of capitalism as beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and carried out a profound analysis and criticism of populist thinking within the party from the standpoint of theory and practice.
Mao Zedong pointed out: Firstly, socialism must be based on a solid material foundation of socialized large-scale production. Whether or not this foundation is needed, "this is the distinction between Marxism and populism." Secondly, the socialist thinking advocated by the populists, which destroys industry and commerce and advocates absolute egalitarianism in the distribution of land, namely, the so-called socialism based on the foundation of small-scale production in rural areas, is "reactionary, backward, and regressive in nature. We must criticize this kind of thinking." Thirdly, this kind of socialism not only protects backward small-scale production, but will also inevitably maintain feudalism, transforming socialism into authoritarianism that suppresses the liberation of individuality. "If the restrained individuality cannot be liberated, there will be no democracy, and there will be no socialism." In short, the socialism advocated by the populists is contrary to the laws of social development and is a utopian and reactionary ideology.
Why should we protect national industry and commerce and allow the development of capitalism that does not manipulate the national economy and people's livelihood? Mao Zedong pointed out: First, "replacing the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism with a certain kind of development of capitalism is not only a progress but also an inevitable process." Secondly, the conditional development of capitalism is not only beneficial to the bourgeoisie, but also to the proletariat, or even more beneficial to the proletariat. China now faces foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism, rather than an increase in domestic capitalism. On the contrary, we have too little capitalism. In short, the development of capitalism under the New Democratic political power is beneficial and harmless. "What we advocate is the New Democratic capitalism. This kind of capitalism has vitality and revolutionary nature," "Its nature is to help socialism, it is revolutionary, useful, and beneficial to the development of socialism."
The conception of the economic structure of the New Democratic society is the core of the theory of the New Democratic economy and an important component of the Party's ideological thought for the New Democratic society.
With the successive victories of the New Democratic Revolution and the implementation of the Three Major Economic Policies, the conception of the economic structure of the New Democratic society gradually took shape. Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" mentioned the economic structure of the New Democratic society, stating: "The large banks, large enterprises, and large businesses belong to the state of this republic... The state-owned economy under the leadership of the proletariat in the New Democratic republic is of a socialist nature and is the leading force of the entire national economy." "Private property of other forms of capitalism is not confiscated, and the development of capitalism that does not manipulate the national economy and people's livelihood is not prohibited. This is because China's economy is still very backward." "Confiscate the land of the landlords... and turn the land into private property for the peasants." "At this stage, it is still not generally establishing socialist agriculture, but various cooperative economies that have developed based on the foundation of 'those who work the land own it' also have socialist elements."
"The wealthy peasant economy in the countryside is also allowed to exist." It is not difficult to see that in the economic structure of the New Democratic society envisioned by Mao Zedong at that time, there are five economic components: state-owned economy, cooperative economy, private capitalist economy, individual economy, and wealthy peasant economy. This conception was further improved a few years later. In December 1947, Mao Zedong further clarified the economic composition of the New Democratic society in the article "The Current Situation and Our Tasks": "(1) State-owned economy, which is the leading component; (2) Agriculture economy gradually moving towards the collective direction from individual ownership; (3) The economic activities of independent small-scale industry and commerce and small to medium-sized private capital."These are all the national economic components of the New Democratic Revolution." This classification combines individual economy and rich peasant economy into agricultural economy. Although it is simpler and more scientific than the classification in "On New Democracy", it only includes the three economic components of state-owned economy, private capitalist economy, and agricultural economy. Obviously, this is incomplete, so this theory needs further development, and it is Zhang Wentian who completes this development process. In July 1948, at the joint meeting of the County Committee Organizational Department and Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Wentian summarized the results of his investigation and research in recent years and proposed the idea of the six components of the New Democratic Revolution: ①state-owned economy or public economy; ②state capitalism; ③private capitalism; ④small commodity economy, mainly peasant economy; ⑤cooperative economy; ⑥nomadic economy. Although this terminology is not perfect and lacks depth in explanation, it provides a complete framework for the composition of the New Democratic Revolution economy. Two months later, based on his report at the urban work conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Wentian wrote a report to the central committee entitled "Outline on the Composition of the Northeast Economic Structure and the Basic Principles of Economic Construction", which clearly presented the five components of the New Democratic Revolution economy, namely "state-owned economy, cooperative economy, state capitalism, private capitalism, small commodity economy (with a small part of natural economy, but less significant, thus omitted)". This is the earliest and most complete exposition of the composition of the New Democratic Revolution economy. Zhang Wentian also made a thorough explanation of the nature, status, development direction, and interrelations of these five economies: ①The state-owned economy is a socialist economy, occupying the leading position in the national economy. ②The cooperative economy is an economy with varying degrees of socialist characteristics, and it is the most reliable and powerful assistant to the state-owned economy. Only through the cooperative economy can agricultural collectivization be realized, and the peasants can move from the New Democratic Revolution towards socialism. ③State capitalism refers to the capitalism "managed and supervised" by the New Democratic Revolution state. This is a form of capitalism in the private capitalist economy that is most conducive to the development of the New Democratic Revolution economy. Therefore, we should consciously recognize the economic category of "state capitalism" and consciously promote and organize it. ④Private capitalism is an economy of capitalist nature. Due to the backwardness of our country's economy, the development of private capitalism is inevitable and to some extent necessary. However, it cannot be allowed to develop without regulation. It must be managed, supervised, and limited to a certain extent. ⑤The small commodity economy is an economy at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. Through long-term education and struggle, under the system of the New Democratic Revolution led by the proletariat, it will develop towards socialism. However, it will go through a "longer transitional period than the Eastern European countries". Zhang Wentian believes that "correctly understanding the nature, status, development direction, and interrelations of these five economies is the starting point and foundation for correctly determining the economic policies of the Northeast, and only by starting from here can we grasp the correct path on the economic front and achieve the correct leadership of the proletariat in social and economic construction." Zhang Wentian's scientific exposition marks the maturity of the conceptualization of the structure of the New Democratic Revolution economy and makes it possible for this conceptualization to be formally formed a year later. Two important documents marked the formal formation of this conceptualization: Mao Zedong's report at the 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (hereinafter referred to as the "Common Program"), which discussed and stipulated the economic structure of the New Democratic Revolution. 
Mao Zedong first expounded the extreme importance of making the state-owned economy the leading component of the entire national economy and then pointed out: "China's private capitalist industry is a force that cannot be ignored... During this period, all urban and rural capitalist elements that are not harmful to the national economy but beneficial to it should be allowed to exist and develop..." "This is not only inevitable, but also economically necessary." Mao Zedong believed that for dispersed individual economies, it is possible and necessary to guide them cautiously, gradually, and actively towards modernization and collectivization. The view of letting them flow freely is mistaken. Mao Zedong also recognized the importance of cooperative economic system, he said: "Without the cooperative economic system, we cannot lead the individual economy of the working people to gradually move toward collectivization, and it is impossible to develop from the new democratic society to the socialist society, and it is impossible to consolidate the leading power of the proletariat in the state power." Finally, he summarized: "State-owned economy is of a socialist nature, cooperative economy is semi-socialist, plus private capitalist economy, individual economy, plus state capitalism which is a combination of state and private cooperation. These are the main economic components of the People's Republic of China. They constitute the economic form of new democracy."
As a temporary constitution, the "Common Program" has unquestionable authority and legal effect. Among its provisions on the economic structure of new democracy, it draws a satisfactory conclusion to the decades-long development process of this idea. When discussing the nature, role, status, and future of the five types of economic components allowed to exist in the new democratic society in a detailed manner, the "Common Program" basically followed Mao Zedong's proposal. Finally, it explicitly stipulates: the fundamental principle of the economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to pursue a policy that takes into account both public and private, benefits both labor and capital, promotes mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and encourages internal and external exchange, in order to develop productivity and prosper the economy. The state should adjust state-owned economy, cooperative economy, individual economics of farmers and artisans, private capitalist economy, and state capitalist economy established through state-private cooperation in terms of scope of operation, supply of raw materials, sales market, labor conditions, technological equipment, fiscal policy, and financial policy. The various economic components should work in division of labor and cooperation under the leadership of the state-owned economy, so that each can acquire what they need, in order to promote the development of the entire socio-economic system. This policy complies with the social reality created by Chinese history and revolution, and it is conducive to exerting the advantages of various economic components and promoting the rapid development of the socio-economic system.
IV. Building a national, scientific, and popular new culture
During the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zedong successively published articles such as "On New Democracy", "Transforming Our Study", "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art", "Cultural Workers Should Unite with the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers", "United Front in Cultural Work", "On the United Government", etc. These articles expressed the understanding of the Communist Party of China on cultural issues, systematically constructed the cultural ideology of new democracy, and formed the cultural program of new democracy.
The Communist Party of China scientifically expounded the historical inevitability of the emergence of new democratic culture from the dialectical relationship between culture and politics, and the economy. Based on the study of the changes in social and cultural structures in China since the Opium War, the Communist Party of China revealed the historical inevitability of the emergence of new democratic culture. Mao Zedong believed that since the Opium War in 1840, China has gradually declined from an independent and complete feudal society to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The change in the social, political, and economic structure inevitably causes changes in culture and cultural structure. Before the Opium War, Chinese culture was a single feudal culture; after the Opium War, in addition to feudal culture, there was also the assimilation culture of imperialism and the democratic culture of the emerging national bourgeoisie. This means that after the Opium War, the nature of Chinese social and cultural changed from being single to being multiple. At this time, on the one hand, feudalism's old culture continues to deeply influence the spiritual life of the Chinese people; on the other hand, feudalism's culture coexists and struggles with the assimilation culture and democratic culture. The uniqueness of China's modern social development and the complexity of ideological and cultural metabolism determine the multi-faceted nature of China's modern social culture, which belongs to a culture of multiple tracks.
In the contradictory evolution of the diverse and parallel cultures in modern China, the bourgeois democratic culture was a powerful force on the cultural front of modern China. Its revolution against feudalistic culture directly served the purpose of the democratic revolution in China and represented the direction of Chinese social development. During the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Xinhai Revolution, advanced Chinese individuals actively studied and promoted Western democratic culture, attempting to establish a democratic culture in China modeled after Western democracy. They used bourgeois democratic culture as their weapon to wage war against feudalistic culture, aiming to awaken the people's desire for reform and national prosperity. However, due to the fact that Chinese bourgeois democratic culture did not emerge from the native soil of feudalistic culture, but rather was transplanted from Western culture, its class foundation was very weak. On the other hand, China's feudalistic culture had a long history, and through successive feudal systems, it had formed a solid national cultural and psychological structure. The culture of imperialism, which aimed to enslave China, allied with feudalistic culture, forming a cultural alliance to oppose bourgeois democratic culture. Therefore, in the struggle between these two opposing camps, bourgeois democratic culture could only fight a few rounds before being forced to retreat by this reactionary alliance. Mao Zedong pointed out, "The old bourgeois democratic culture has already decayed and become powerless in the era of imperialism, and its failure was inevitable." The culture of new democracy emerged under these historical conditions. This means that the bankruptcy of the old democratic culture in the era of imperialism and the emergence of new democratic culture were both inevitable results of modern historical development.
After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the advanced proletariat, with its uncompromising anti-imperialist and anti-feudal spirit, entered the stage of Chinese history and demonstrated a new and powerful political force, which added new content to modern Chinese society. The New Culture Movement that developed rapidly after the May Fourth Movement became a movement of Marxist thought. Thus, in the diverse and parallel cultures of modern China, a new cultural content was injected, leading to a historic turning point in the direction of modern culture. On one hand, old democratic culture in China suffered multiple setbacks and was full of deficiencies after prolonged struggles against imperialistic and feudal cultures, but it still preserved its progressive nature. On the other hand, old democratic culture in China was indeed powerless to overthrow feudalistic and enslaving cultures. Only with the guidance of Marxism, the advanced proletariat's new democratic culture could truly overturn feudalistic and enslaving cultures. The new democratic culture of the proletariat gradually became the main force behind the cultural revolution in modern China.The Communist Party of China clearly pointed out that new democratic culture is the culture of the proletariat's leadership over the masses, against imperialism and feudalism, which is the most distinctive historical characteristic of new democratic culture. Mao Zedong pointed out that the cultural front or ideological front in China had formed two different historical periods before and after the May Fourth Movement. Before the May Fourth Movement, the struggle on the cultural front in China was a battle between the new bourgeois culture and the old feudal culture. The conflicts between schools and the imperial examination system, between new and old studies, and between Western and Chinese studies all had this nature. At that time, the so-called schools, new studies, and Western studies were mostly in line with the natural sciences needed by the bourgeoisie and the social and political theories of the bourgeoisie (although they were also mixed with many remnants of Chinese feudalism). He believed that this so-called new learning had a revolutionary role in fighting against Chinese feudal thinking and served the bourgeois democratic revolution in the previous era. However, due to the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the entry of the world into the era of imperialism, this bourgeois thinking could only fight a few rounds before being forced to retreat by the reactionary alliance of imperialistic ideas from foreign countries and the revivalist ideas of Chinese feudalism. Once this reactionary alliance counterattacked, the so-called new learning would cease, announce its retreat, lose its soul, and be reduced to a mere shell.
Therefore, he concluded that the old bourgeois democratic culture had become corrupt and powerless in the era of imperialism, and its failure was inevitable. This was not the case after the May Fourth Movement. After the May Fourth Movement, China produced a completely new cultural force, which was the communist cultural ideology led by the Chinese Communists, namely the communist worldview and theory of social revolution. As the era was marked by the First World War and the October Revolution, when the national question and the revolutionary movement in the colonies changed the world, the Chinese revolution became closely connected to the world revolution. With the emergence of the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese Communist Party as the political vanguard in China, this cultural force, in new attire and armed with new weapons, united with all possible allied forces and launched a courageous attack on imperialist and feudal cultures. This cultural force made great strides in the fields of social sciences and literature and art, including philosophy, economics, political science, military science, history, literature, and art (including drama, film, music, sculpture, and painting). This new cultural force revolutionized both ideology and form (including language) to an unprecedented extent. Its enormous momentum and formidable power made it invincible. Its mobilization surpassed any previous period in Chinese history. 
Therefore, Mao Zedong emphasized that before the May Fourth Movement, China's new culture belonged to the old democratic culture, which was part of the capitalist cultural revolution led by the world bourgeoisie. After the May Fourth Movement, however, China's new culture belonged to the new democratic culture, which was part of the socialist cultural revolution led by the world proletariat. Before the May Fourth Movement, China's new cultural movement and cultural revolution were led by the bourgeoisie, who still played a leading role. After the May Fourth Movement, the bourgeoisie's cultural ideology lagged behind its political ideology and played no leading role. At most, it served as an ally during the revolutionary period, but the role of alliance leader fell on the shoulders of proletarian cultural ideology. This is an iron-clad fact that cannot be denied by anyone.
Based on this, Mao Zedong draws the following conclusion: the so-called new democratic culture is the culture of the people opposing imperialism and feudalism, and today it is the culture of the anti-Japanese united front. This culture can only be led by proletarian cultural ideology, namely communist ideology, and no other class's cultural ideology can lead it. In a word, the culture of the new democratic culture is the culture led by the proletariat for the people in their opposition to imperialism and feudalism. The fundamental attribute of new democratic culture is that it is led by proletarian socialist cultural ideology. Mao Zedong first criticized the prevalent bourgeois reactionary culture at the time and pointed out that the bourgeoisie's reactionaries were completely wrong in cultural matters, just as they were in power matters. They didn't understand the historical characteristics of the new era in China and didn't recognize the new democratic culture of the people. Their starting point was bourgeois authoritarianism, which manifested as bourgeois cultural authoritarianism. Some of the so-called "Western-style" cultural figures had actually supported the Nationalist government's cultural "suppression of communists," and now they seem to be supporting policies such as "restricting communists" and "absorbing communists." They did not want the working class and peasants to rise politically or culturally. The cultural authoritarianism of the bourgeois reactionaries is a dead end, just like their power problem, and it lacks both domestic and international conditions. Therefore, it would be wise to "fold up" this cultural authoritarianism.
Then, he criticized the mistaken view that the leadership of the new democratic revolution belonged exclusively to the proletariat, and that new democratic culture was therefore socialist in nature. He pointed out that, as far as the policy of national culture is concerned, the guiding ideology is communist thought, and we should strive to promote socialism and communism among the working class, and to educate farmers and other masses in socialism through proper and gradual socialist education. However, the entire national culture is not yet socialist. The political, economic, and cultural aspects of new democratic revolution, due to their leadership by the proletariat, all have socialist elements, and these elements are not ordinary, but decisive. However, when it comes to the overall political, economic, and cultural situation, it is still not socialist, but new democratic. This is because in the current stage of revolution, the main task is to fight against foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism, and it is a bourgeois democratic revolution, not a socialist revolution aimed at overthrowing capitalism. In terms of national culture, it is incorrect to think that the current entire national culture is or should be socialist. This is mistaking the promotion of the communist ideological system as the practical action plan of the current stage; it is treating the use of the communist standpoint and methods to observe problems, study knowledge, handle work, and train cadres as the policy of the entire national education and culture in the Chinese democratic revolution stage. A national culture with socialist content must reflect the politics and economy of socialism. We have socialist elements in our politics and economy, and these are also reflected in our national culture; but in terms of the whole society, we have not yet formed this kind of overall socialist politics and economy, so we cannot have this kind of overall socialist national culture. Since the current Chinese revolution is part of the world proletarian socialist revolution, the current Chinese new culture is also part of the world proletarian socialist new culture, and is a great ally of it; although it contains significant elements of socialist culture, it still does not qualify to fully participate in the entire national culture as socialist culture, but rather qualifies to participate as new democratic culture of the people opposing imperialism and feudalism. Since the current Chinese revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, the current Chinese new culture also cannot be separated from the ideological leadership of the Chinese proletariat, that is, the leadership of communist thought. However, this leadership in the current stage is leading the masses in the political and cultural revolutions against imperialism and feudalism, so the content of the entire new national culture is still new democratic, not socialist. At present, without a doubt, the promotion of communist ideology should be expanded, and the study of Marxism-Leninism should be intensified. Without this promotion and study, not only will it not be possible to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but it will also not be possible to guide the current democratic revolution to victory. However, we must distinguish between the promotion of the ideological system and social system of communism from the practical application of the action plan of new democratic revolution; and we must also distinguish between communist theory and methods used for observing problems, studying knowledge, handling work, and training cadres, from the policy of new democratic culture of the entire national culture. It is definitely inappropriate to mix the two together. Based on the above analysis, Mao Zedong pointed out that the content of China's new national culture at the current stage is neither bourgeois cultural imperialism, nor pure proletarian socialism, but rather a new democratic culture led by the ideology of proletarian socialist culture and the masses opposing imperialism and feudalism.
Based on the social and political development in China, Mao Zedong put forward the basic content of building a new democratic culture. Mao Zedong pointed out that the new democratic culture is first and foremost a national culture, "it is anti-imperialist oppression, advocating the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation. It belongs to our nation and carries our national characteristics" .Mao Zedong emphasized the importance of Chinese culture having its own distinct characteristics, its own form of expression, which is the national form, because "it belongs to our nation." Mao advocated for Chinese culture to have a national form and the content of new democracy, but he was not simply "fond of the new and tired of the old." He particularly emphasized the historical continuity of Chinese culture, as the source and foundation of the national characteristic culture he admired. He emphasized the independence of the Chinese nation in cultural development, which was based on the emphasis on imperialism and the theme of proletarian revolution, and fully affirmed the significance of China's political and cultural struggles against imperialism in modern times. 
At the same time, Mao Zedong believed that in the context of world revolution, emphasizing the cultural development of national characteristics does not mean establishing a narrow and closed nationalist culture. On the contrary, the construction of a new Chinese national culture should be open and should be united with the socialist and new democratic cultures of other nations in the world, establishing relationships of mutual absorption and mutual development, and jointly forming a new world culture, which is a revolutionary national culture.
Mao Zedong linked the development of national culture with world culture, and this idea greatly laid a strong foundation and prospects for the development of China's new democratic culture. In his work "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," he criticized the practice of "separating the content of internationalism from national forms, which is the approach of those who do not understand internationalism at all." He believed that Chinese culture should "unite with the socialist culture and new democratic culture of all other nations, establishing relationships of mutual absorption and mutual development, and jointly forming a new world culture." He advocated "absorbing fresh things from foreign countries, not only their progressive ideas, but also their fresh language." We should absorb the elements we need from foreign languages. Mao Zedong pointed out, "China should absorb a large amount of progressive foreign culture as raw material for its own cultural nourishment, which has not been done enough in the past." Mao Zedong believed that not only the current socialist and new democratic culture, but also foreign ancient cultures, such as the culture of the capitalist states during the Enlightenment era, should be absorbed if they are useful to us today. By regarding new democratic culture as the result of absorbing the spiritual wealth of the Chinese people and even of all mankind, Mao Zedong maintained the dialectical and comprehensive cultural standpoint of early Chinese Marxists, truly clarifying the exploration of the development of Chinese culture dating back to Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, and others, and completing an important stage in historical development.
Here, Mao Zedong put forward a famous principle: "Just like with food, all foreign things must be chewed and digested by our own mouths and the movements of our stomach, breaking them down into essences and residues, and then excreting the residues while absorbing the essences, in order to benefit our body. We must not absorb them uncritically and indiscriminately." This not only summarized the experience of the Chinese revolution, but also correctly grasped the direction of the development of the New Culture Movement since the May Fourth Movement. In his article "Oppose Dogmatism," Mao Zedong criticized the formalism of the May Fourth Movement, pointing out that many of its leaders did not have the critical spirit of Marxism, and the methods they used were generally bourgeois methods, that is, formalistic methods.
"They opposed the old eight-legged essay and dogmatism, and advocated science and democracy, which was correct. However, in regard to the present situation, history, and foreign affairs, they lacked the critical spirit of historical materialism. Everything bad was absolute bad, and everything good was absolute good. This formalistic way of looking at problems influenced the development of this movement later on." Dogmatism and the "complete Westernization" were the "left" and "right" extremes of this formalistic conception.Mao Zedong specifically mentioned the adverse effects of formalism on the Chinese communist movement and the dissemination of Marxism. He pointed out that the basic principles of Marxism must be completely and appropriately unified with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, "that is to say, it must be combined with the characteristics of the nation, and through certain national forms, in order to be useful. It cannot be subjectively and formulaically applied." "Formulaic Marxism" is undoubtedly a subjective and dogmatic Marxism, which starts from the standpoint of "orthodoxy" and appears in an extremely "leftist" manner, causing enormous damage to the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong pointed out that the Chinese revolution must oppose "formulaic Marxism," and similarly, Chinese culture should also have its own forms, which are national forms. "National form, content of the New Democratic Revolution – this is our new culture today."
Furthermore, the New Democratic Revolution culture is scientific. "It opposes all feudal and superstitious ideas, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the unity of theory and practice."
Inheriting the spirit of upholding scientific rationality since the May Fourth Movement, Mao Zedong pointed out that in the cause of anti-imperialism and anti-feudal superstition, the scientific thinking of the Chinese proletariat could establish a united front with the progressive bourgeoisie's materialistic philosophers and natural scientists to carry out the enlightenment cause since the May Fourth Movement. Here, Mao Zedong proposed a scientific methodological principle for dealing with the historical and cultural heritage. First, Mao Zedong made the judgment of the nature of Chinese historical culture: "In China's long feudal society, a brilliant ancient culture was created." Therefore, when clearing the heritage of ancient culture, it is necessary to "eliminate its feudal dregs and absorb its democratic essence." This is a necessary condition for developing and enhancing the national self-confidence of the Chinese nation's new culture. Second, this cleansing work cannot be done without discrimination and inclusiveness. It is necessary to distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the splendid folk culture that has democratic and revolutionary elements. Third, history cannot be cut off because the current new culture in China has developed from the old culture of ancient times, so it is necessary to respect one's own history. "But this kind of respect gives history a scientific status, respects the development of the dialectics of history, and does not praise the past while criticizing the present, nor does it praise any feudal poison." Applying the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism, Mao Zedong has surpassed the debate over "ancient and modern, Chinese and Western" culture in the May Fourth era and resolved the methodological principles for inheriting cultural traditions in China. Undoubtedly, this principle is not only the inevitable result of the cultural standpoint of dialectical synthesis held by early Chinese Marxists such as Li Dazhao but also a summary of the regularity of the Chinese cultural and historical movement.
Mao Zedong believes that the method of creating new culture can only be adhered to starting from practice. In his December 1936 work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," he pointed out: "Reading is learning, but using is also learning, and it is even more important learning." This indicates the methodology of learning from using. In the "Rectify the Party's Style" document, he issued a call to the entire Party, urging everyone to "learn to apply the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and seriously study China's history, economy, politics, military, and culture." Because "in order to master Marxist theory, you must be able to grasp it, apply it, and the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application."
To maintain the advancement of new culture, Mao Zedong believes that the advancement of cultural effects lies in representing the direction of social development, representing the interests of advanced classes, and playing a role in promoting social development and progress. In his work "On New Democracy," he clearly stated, "We want to turn China, a country that has been ruled by old culture and is ignorant and backward, into a country ruled by new culture and is civilized and advanced." "Establishing a new culture of the Chinese nation, this is our goal in the field of culture." It is precisely because of this that he fully affirmed the great significance of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, which was thoroughly and uncompromisingly anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, because it was consistent with the democratic revolutionary tasks of modern China in anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and marked the beginning of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution.
Finally, the new democratic culture is a popular culture. Mao Zedong pointed out that it should serve more than 90% of the working class, peasants, and laboring masses of the entire nation, and gradually become their culture. The knowledge of revolutionary educational cadres and the knowledge of the educational masses should be distinguished and connected in terms of degree. The improvement and popularization should also be distinguished and connected. This is another vivid embodiment of the Party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts. On the one hand, cultural construction should serve the fundamental purpose of revolution, and on the other hand, cultural construction lays the ideological and cultural foundation for revolution. In terms of the direction of cultural construction, the Party emphasizes the connection between democracy and cultural construction, so as to reverse the one-sidedness of the cultural movement and truly penetrate into society and the working class, becoming a bottom-up social and cultural revolution.For this reason, the Party points out that popular and democratic culture does not mean treating all objects indiscriminately, using the same pattern, methods, and content for cultural education. Mao Zedong believed that attention should be paid to two distinctions and connections: distinguishing and connecting the knowledge of revolutionary educational cadres and the knowledge of the educational masses in terms of degree, and distinguishing and connecting improvement and popularization. Mao Zedong's thoughts are clearly stated in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. He believed that the premise and foundation for popularization and improvement should be the working class and peasants because "since our literature and art is mainly for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, popularization means popularizing to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and improvement means improving from the workers, peasants, and soldiers." He pointed out that popularization is the foundation and improvement is the development. "Improvement should be emphasized, but emphasizing improvement in a one-sided and isolated way, emphasizing to an inappropriate extent, is wrong." This is because it overlooks the actual ideological and cultural conditions of the Chinese working class and peasants and fails to recognize the tasks faced by popularization and improvement. Mao Zedong emphasized the importance and urgency of popularization, but it does not mean neglecting improvement. He believed that the two cannot be separated completely. Because popularization requires development, it also continuously improves the ideological and cultural level of the working masses, and therefore requires more than simple popularization. It is precisely because of this that "popularization work not only does not hinder improvement, but also provides a foundation for current limited improvement work and prepares necessary conditions for future extensive improvement work." Mao Zedong divided improvement into two types: improvement of the masses and improvement of cadres. The connection between the two types of improvement lies in their service to the people, while the distinction lies in the level of education. Therefore, he proposed that literature and art should include both advanced literature and art developed from a basic level and needed by the improved masses or primarily needed by the cadres among the masses, as well as basic literature and art that are often needed by the broadest masses under the guidance of such advanced literature and art.
For the people, the new democratic culture should also be a powerful weapon for revolution. The Party points out that revolutionary culture is the ideological preparation for revolution before it happens and is a necessary and important front in the united front of revolution during the revolution. And the revolutionary cultural workers are the commanders of this cultural front at all levels. "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." It can be seen how important the revolutionary cultural movement is to the practical movement of revolution. And both of these movements, cultural and practical, are for the masses. Therefore, all progressive cultural workers should have their own cultural army in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this army is the people. To be a revolutionary cultural worker without being close to the masses is to be a "commander without troops", and his firepower will not be able to defeat the enemy.In order to achieve this goal, the written language must be reformed under certain conditions, and the spoken language must be close to the people, as the people are the infinite source of revolutionary culture.The establishment of the program for the new democratic culture signifies an important theoretical milestone in the process of the Sinicization of Marxism. It has found the basic direction of Chinese cultural development in the historical clues of China's cultural revolution in modern times. It opposes both national nihilism and narrow nationalism. It opposes the erroneous ideological trends of "left" and right, and lays a theoretical foundation for the development of Chinese culture.
