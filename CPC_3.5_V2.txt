Chapter 1 Extension and Preparation: The Twisting Process and Reasons for the Sinification of Marxism in China from 1949 to 1978
The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party proposed the important idea of two leaps in the Sinification of Marxism in China, that is, "the combination of Marxism and our country's practice has been through more than 60 years. In this process, there have been two historical leaps. The first leap occurred during the period of the New Democratic Revolution," and "the second leap occurred after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party." So, how should we summarize the process and characteristics of the Sinification of Marxism in China between the two leaps, that is, from the establishment of the new China to the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party? On this matter, Gong Yuzhi once pointed out that this was a period of "extension of the first leap and preparation (or brewing) of the second leap." This is a well-argued judgment.
I. The four stages of the 29-year process of the Sinification of Marxism.
The Sinicization of Marxism is a historical category that has different contents, focuses, objects, and targets in different historical periods. Examining this process and the characteristics of each stage is a prerequisite for revealing its laws of development. Based on the understanding of Marxism and socialism from 1949 to 1978, as well as the mode selection and practice determined by this understanding, the Sinicization of Marxism during these 29 years can be roughly divided into four stages.
The first stage: the period of implementing the program for the establishment of a New Democratic China (1949-1952). In the first three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the guidance of the theory of New Democraticism, which was the first leap in the Sinicization of Marxism, the Party fully implemented the program for the establishment of a New Democratic China as set forth in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (hereinafter referred to as the "Common Program"). Economically, starting from a very backward level of productivity at that time, the policy of balancing public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges was implemented based on the priority development of state-owned economy. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, multiple economic components coexisted, and planning and market coexisted. Various forms of distribution and accumulation coexisted. At the same time, the political and cultural program of New Democracy was implemented, thereby maintaining a basic adaptation between the productive forces and the relations of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base.
The program for the establishment of a New Democratic China was based on the victorious New Democratic Revolution and aimed at the transition to socialism. It fully developed on the basis of the colonies and semi-colonies and prepared the necessary conditions for the establishment of socialism politically, economically, and culturally. Its distinctive feature is the correct treatment of capitalism, the national bourgeoisie, market economy, and individual peasant economy. The state did not generally eliminate capitalism, but encouraged the enthusiasm for private businesses that were beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. A mixed economy was implemented, allowing for the coexistence of both market and planned economies, state-owned, cooperative, and private economies, as well as individual and cooperative economies for common prosperity. In these aspects, it is highly compatible with Lenin's New Economic Policy, his theory of the transitional period since 1921, and Marx's theory of Eastern societies. From the perspective of its pragmatic thought, it not only inherits and develops the essence of Marxism but also combines it with practical reality. The three-year period of economic recovery and social transformation achieved miraculous accomplishments. While marveling at these achievements, one should also pay great attention to the guiding principles and institutional design that led to these achievements. "When the Common Program was first formulated, people doubted whether we would really implement it. But in the past three years, we have truly implemented the Common Program, so it enjoys good credibility among the people and all political parties."
Although the implementation of the program for the establishment of a New Democratic China lasted only three short years, it was a splendid chapter in the Sinicization of Marxism. It greatly enriched the theory of how underdeveloped countries can transition to socialism through a special path. It has distinct Chinese characteristics in both form and content and represents a paradigm in which Chinese Communists, represented by Mao Zedong, consciously integrate the basic principles of Marxism with the actual conditions of China and independently create a path different from the European revolutionary path.
Phase Two: Following the Soviet Model Period (1953-1956). From 1953 onwards, based on the recovery of the national economy and the urgent needs of the changing domestic and international situations, and drawing from the experience of Soviet socialist construction and the understanding of socialism at that time, the Party Central Committee proposed the gradual realization of the country's socialist industrialization and the gradual transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry through socialist reform during the transitional period. In terms of economic construction, the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry was chosen. In terms of social transformation, the policy of transforming capitalist industry through state capitalism and peaceful redemption, and the gradual transformation of agriculture and individual handicrafts, was chosen. Guided by this overall approach, the foundation for industrialization was initially laid, and a path for socialist transformation suitable to China's national conditions was opened, thereby successfully achieving the goal of socialism. This was another great victory achieved by the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, and an important achievement in the localization of Marxism.
From the perspective of model selection, if the first three years were close to the model of Lenin's New Economic Policy, then after 1953 it was based on the model of Stalin. This is also what Mao Zedong later called "learning from foreign experiences," which was "basically consistent with the Soviet model, with some differences." In terms of economic construction, especially heavy industry, "almost everything was copied from the Soviet Union, with very little creativity." "Lack of creativity, lack of independent and autonomous ability." In terms of politics and social transformation, it emphasized following the Soviet model, eliminating individual production in capitalism, agriculture, and handicrafts, implementing a single socialist public ownership, and limiting the role and depth of the commodity economy. This is what was said at that time, that the transitional period is about resolving the issue of ownership, namely making private ownership "gradually illegal", "making capitalism extinct, and making small-scale production extinct," and so on. Its essence is to make socialist ownership of the means of production the only economic foundation of our country and society. Therefore, "the transitional period is a period of struggle between dying capitalism and growing communism." Reflected in the outline of the transitional period's propaganda, the understanding of Lenin's theory of the transitional period actually refers to Stalin's interpretation and development of Lenin's wartime communist thought before 1920, rather than Lenin's late focus on the development of productive forces in his new economic policy thought. This was a common practice for some socialist countries after the war based on the prevailing traditional socialist notions in the international communist movement. In terms of China, it can be said that its characteristics, to some extent, were the Sinicization of the Soviet model (while the Soviet model had already become a target for reform at that time), or a form of Marxist Sinicization mediated by the Stalin model.
Due to the party's profound understanding of the national situation and the rich experience of the democratic revolution period, as well as its enormous creativity, although in terms of content, the main imitation was based on the Soviet model during these four years, there were distinct Chinese characteristics in terms of form, especially in the three major transformations. In terms of political system construction, there were some unique and successful creations (such as people's democratic dictatorship, the system of people's congresses, multi-party cooperation, political consultation system, etc.), which reflected the combination of universal Marxist truth and Chinese reality.
Phase Three: Reforming the Soviet Model and Exploring One's Own Development Path Period (1956-1966). From 1956 onwards, in the wave of socialist reforms worldwide and in view of the problems exposed by the Soviet model, when comprehensive socialist construction started in our country, just as during the democratic revolution period, Mao Zedong once again put forward the task of breaking through the Soviet model and combining Marxism with Chinese reality in a sharp manner. He pointed out: "Now we have our own preliminary practice, as well as the experience and lessons of the Soviet Union. We should emphasize starting from China's national conditions, make efforts to combine (theory and practice), and 'carry out a second combination, find the correct path for socialist revolution and construction in China'."
With the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the publication of important historical documents such as "On the Ten Major Relationships" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," China began its initial reform of the Soviet model, making 1956 a peak period of the Sinicization of Marxism in the socialist era. The whole party "learned from the Soviet Union" to emancipate their minds and hoped to find a socialist development path that suited China's special characteristics while freeing themselves from complete dependence on the Soviet model. Mao Zedong later said many times that in the previous few years, economic development primarily involved learning from foreign experiences. In 1956, with the publication of "On the Ten Major Relationships," the CPC began to propose its own development path, which had its own unique contents.
Due to the CPC's tremendous spirit of innovation and ability to create, before and after the Eighth National Congress, the party put forward some new and important viewpoints and policies in the fields of economic, political, cultural, and scientific development. The initial results of these reforms were achieved. Of course, due to the limitations of the times, the initial reforms could not address some fundamental flaws within the traditional system. Instead, they focused on making micro-adjustments and repairs within its basic framework, under the principle of "same principles as the Soviet Union, but different methods."
The shaking of the authoritative status of the Soviet model provided space and momentum for emancipating minds. However, for any successful reform, merely emancipating minds is not enough. It also requires other important conditions, such as mature awareness, correct ideological methods, internal and external party democracy, and the accumulation of necessary experiences, including lessons from mistakes. It is precisely because these conditions were lacking that, after 1957, despite the strong desire to emancipate minds, oppose dogmatism, and explore its own development path, the outcome often resulted in the absolutization of their own experiences or the replacement of one dogma with another, leading to a return to more traditional concepts. As a result, the breakthrough from the traditional model has led to serious mistakes in class struggle and economic development during the socialist period, often resulting in the dogmatization and experientialization of the Sinicization of Marxism. In formal terms, the bold experiments such as the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes were indeed different from the traditional model, but they often simply copied some ideas about the future society from classic writers in the 19th century, or drew inspiration from the experiences of war periods and even from ancient Chinese society in constructing the future society. In essence, they were extreme versions of the traditional model.
From late 1958 to 1960, while summing up experience and correcting "left" mistakes, the entire Party deepened its understanding of the principle of distribution according to work and the law of value, emphasizing the importance of combining public ownership, commodity economy, and planning in socialist construction. In the early 1960s, during the adjustment period, Mao Zedong once again put forward to the whole Party: "We must combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific realities of socialist construction in China, as well as with the specific realities of future world revolution, as well as possible and from practice step by step understand the objective laws of struggle. We must be prepared for many failures and setbacks due to blindness, in order to gain experience and achieve final victory." In accordance with the central call, the entire Party earnestly read and relearned, vigorously promoted investigation and research, summarized experience, and conducted comprehensive and profound adjustments. Through reflection on the "Great Leap Forward" movement and the people's commune movement, within a few years, the entire Party, starting from the national conditions, focused on productivity standards, and adjusted agriculture, industry, and other sectors, as well as internal and external political relations. A large number of regulations affecting various industries, represented by the "Working Regulations of the Agricultural People's Communes (Revised Draft)" (referred to as "Sixty Articles on Agriculture"), were formulated and implemented. The support of the top leadership in the central government for the "responsibility system for fields" and the "contracting production to households" policies, Mao Zedong's new understanding of the stage of socialist development, Liu Shaoqi's realistic estimate of the difficulties and their causes, Deng Xiaoping's views on socialism reflected in standards such as whether production and development can be restored and developed relatively quickly and whether the masses are willing, as well as a series of important ideas on socialism put forward by Sun Yefang, Zhang Wentian, and others, such as the "planned commodity economy," deepened the understanding of socialism and included some basic ideas and approaches for China's subsequent reforms. It was another peak of the Sinicization of Marxism during the socialist period. It can be imagined that if the adjustments continued to deepen, the second leap of Sinicization might occur ahead of schedule.
The adjustment started from rectifying the serious chaos caused by the "Great Leap Forward" movement and the people's commune movement in all aspects. Therefore, in the initial stage, more emphasis was placed on the restoration and return to the traditional system and order. The substantive reform of the traditional system was still in its infancy. With the deepening of the adjustment, some deep-seated issues related to "what is socialism" came to the surface, and the Sinicization of Marxism faced a major choice: either carry out theoretical innovation while promoting the adjustment, break free from the shackles of traditional concepts, and achieve a second leap, or measure the new phenomena and problems in the adjustment with traditional concepts and thus deny the reform sprouts that appeared in the adjustment. Because the conditions for socialist reforms were not yet ripe worldwide at that time, some traditional concepts still deeply constrained people's minds, and "several deeply rooted traditional concepts have not been broken through." These concepts were even used to measure the theory and practice of the adjustment, and to judge socialist reforms based on the vision of 19th-century classic writers about future society. As a result, some substantial reform measures and viewpoints were regarded as "revisionism" challenging the orthodox position of Marxism. And at a time when it was urgently necessary to emancipate the mind, pool wisdom, and explore innovation, the democratic atmosphere within and outside the Party shrank due to the development of the expansion of class struggle. Under the influence of these factors, the deepening of the adjustment triggered a serious estimation of the situation of class struggle. Thus, on the one hand, there was the gradual deepening of the adjustment and to a certain extent the correction of "left" mistakes, and on the other hand, there was the wrong development of the expansion of class struggle. The interaction of these two factors, together with the influence of some international factors, made it difficult to contain the development of the latter, ultimately leading to the occurrence of the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
Phase 4: Period of the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976). Due to its serious assessment of the situation, the "Cultural Revolution" hoped to achieve "great order" through "great chaos." The development model it established, which emphasized "revolutionary fervor and promoting production," was indeed different from the traditional model, but it completely deviated from the correct direction of socialist reform. The criticism during this movement of "capitalism," "revisionism," "capitalist roaders," "material incentives," "the dominance of profit," "the dominance of bonuses," and the "household responsibility system" all showed a disconnect from modern society and a rejection of various aspects of commodity economy, monetary exchange, "bourgeois rights," and different types of distinctions. The "Cultural Revolution" took the extreme form of the errors that had emerged in the previous decade, and it was a mistaken response to the reform trends in China in the 1950s and 1960s as well as in other socialist countries. Although it appeared to have distinct Chinese characteristics in form, in reality it was separate from China's actual situation and deviated from the essence of Marxism, leading Marxist sinicization astray.
During the ten years, the healthy forces within the party resisted and fought against the turmoil and extreme leftist ideologies, adhering to the correct direction of Marxist sinicization in a difficult environment. The series of policy guidelines proposed during the two rectification movements led by Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping were important extensions of Marxist sinicization.
The "Cultural Revolution" pushed to an extreme those errors that simultaneously departed from Marxism and did not align with China's national conditions. As a result, it clarified and simplified some long-standing confusing issues, and it also created sufficient conditions for ultimately correcting these errors. "Without the lessons of the 'Cultural Revolution,' it would not have been possible to formulate the ideological, political, organizational guidelines and a series of policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee." The "Cultural Revolution" has become our wealth and has become a classroom for the entire nation.
In the two years following the end of the "Cultural Revolution," a groundbreaking ideological liberation movement swept across the country and the Communist Party. Through the criticism of "the Two Whatevers" and the discussion of the criteria for truth, traditional concepts that had long constrained people were thoroughly shaken, breaking free from dogmatism and reestablishing Mao Zedong's advocated ideology of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This great movement of ideological liberation laid a solid foundation for the second leap forward in Marxist sinicization and the successful socialist reform. All of this can be seen as substantial compensation for past arduous explorations.
II. The dilemma of choosing a socialist reform model
With a long history of testing and creativity, the Communist Party of China, a leading collective that successfully led the new democratic revolution by achieving the Sinicization of Marxism during the period of democratic revolution and strongly arming itself with Marxist theory for 29 years after the founding of New China, why did it fail to achieve a second leap in 29 years after the founding of New China? Among the numerous reasons, two should be particularly noted: the delay in modernizing the socialist model and the lag in modernizing Marxism.
For the international communist movement and socialist countries, 1956 was the year when the traditional socialist model of the Soviet Union began to undergo large-scale reform. "Since 1956, the umbilical cord that connected the various communist parties to the Soviet Union as their sole source of sustenance was cut. Each party began to formulate its own attitude towards communist theory and practice." In the communist movement, a "multi-centric" situation emerged. "People no longer talked about any unique leadership; instead, they discussed the progress made as a result of following different paths." "The Soviet model can no longer, nor should it be, the model that must be followed." Since then, although socialist countries have still been greatly influenced by the traditional model overall, they have started the transition from one model to multiple models.
The sacred halo of the traditional model has disappeared, and the authority of the Marxist theoretical system interpreted by the Soviet Communist Party has weakened. Alongside the liberation of thought and theoretical activism, a certain degree of model vacuum has also appeared. This has both partially relieved communist parties and workers' parties in various countries from constraints and pressures, expanding the space for various forms of nationalized Marxism, and also caused them to lose standard answers on which they can rely and draw reference from. Due to differences in the level of economic development, historical and cultural traditions, and geographical conditions, there are inevitably many differences in the understanding and reform of the traditional model (i.e., the Stalinist model) among different countries. In order to find a development path suitable for their own countries, they have not only referred to the Soviet model but also sought answers directly from the original works of Marx and Engels or drawn inspiration from their own country's historical and cultural traditions and contemporary world civilization. Regardless of how many twists and mistakes were made in the reforms at that time, and regardless of their subsequent development, it is still worth affirming that they independently and autonomously sought a path for their own socialist revolution and construction in new historical conditions. Even the Soviet model, which was still in the mainstream position from the 1950s to the 1970s, was different from the traditional model before 1956.
The reforms in countries like the Soviet Union in the following twenty years were a series of ups and downs, halts and stumbling steps. Although some achievements were made, due to the constraints of traditional concepts, there was still no substantial progress on fundamental theoretical issues such as the ownership structure in socialist societies, planned economy and market economy, highly centralized power, and the transition to communism until the 1980s. The reforms often focused on peripheral modifications of the traditional system and were satisfied with certain improvements to the planned economy, rarely touching the core elements of the old model.
For China, in 1956, it faced a unique situation of dual transitions: the shift of the focus of work from revolution to comprehensive socialist construction, and the transition in development mode from blindly emulating tradition to exploring its own path of development. This dual transition increased the difficulty of sinicizing Marxism compared to the situation in 1953 when there was a nationwide wave of studying the Soviet Union. It required a skeptical and reformist approach to everything being established based on the Soviet model and emphasized independent and innovative models. This provided both a historical opportunity for liberating our minds and achieving a second leap forward, as well as increased difficulty in choosing a model and expanded space for the influence of historical and cultural traditions. Just as the first leap forward in sinicizing Marxism during the period of democratic revolution was measured by the core theory of proposing new democratic theory, whether the second leap forward can be achieved during the socialist period will be measured by the ability to find a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Under the guidance of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, new achievements were made in construction and reform after 1956. The flaws of the Stalinist model were corrected, Mao Zedong Thought further developed, and the sinicization of Marxism continued. However, due to the influence of dogmatism and empiricism, there was also a tendency to correct the traditional model from another direction in order to make it "pure" and "radical" than before. Especially during the 1960s, in the ideological debate regarding the international communist movement, the outline of a socialist model that was different from the Soviet model and did not conform to the Chinese national conditions or the trend of contemporary socialist reforms gradually became clear: equating a single ownership structure and highly centralized planned economy with socialism, considering the existence and development of private capital and private enterprises within a certain scope as capitalist development, emphasizing economic means such as profit, price, market regulation, material interests, and narrowing the scope of planned regulation, conducting trade with capitalist countries within a certain range as capitalist and revisionist activities. Class struggle was considered the main contradiction and driving force of socialism. Efforts to break away from the Soviet model lost the right direction. Under this more extreme standard of observation than the traditional model, it was reasonable to deepen the vigilance and concerns about the restoration of capitalism, and the ideology of "taking class struggle as the guiding principle" gained the upper hand. In June 1966, Mao Zedong stated that over a hundred parties in the world had turned revisionist and no longer believed in Marxism-Leninism. The basis for this judgment was, to a considerable extent, the use of the traditional model or even more extreme models as the criteria for evaluating "socialist" or "capitalist" characteristics, and considering all reforms of the model, some of which indeed went astray, as "revisionism". In the "Cultural Revolution," this kind of model was manifested in a more extreme form.
Looking at the political and economic development of China from 1956 to 1978, we can see a cycle of "left" - rectification of "left" - the resurgence of "left" - and then rectification of "left". This cycle is actually the external manifestation of the dilemma in choosing a model, reflecting the difficulties in the transformation of the socialist model from traditional to contemporary and the difficulties in the second integration of Marxism with China's actual conditions.
The reform of socialism generally emerges when socialism has reached a certain level of development and conflicts with the existing model. The sharper the contradiction, the stronger the demand for reform, and the earlier it appears. The Soviet reform emerged nearly forty years after the October Revolution and nearly twenty years after the completion of socialist transformation. In Eastern European countries, especially those countries with higher pre-revolutionary economic development than old Russia, they felt the constraints of the Soviet model from the beginning, and the contradictions became more prominent after the 1950s. "Between 1955 and 1956, the consequences caused by the old and outdated management system were already obvious and quite serious... These consequences have even reached catastrophic levels in some production sectors." The reform that first emerged in the Soviet Eastern European countries is a reflection and outcome of these contradictions. In other words, in terms of the conditions for reform, the Soviet Eastern European countries were obviously more mature than our country.
China entered the era of reform when it had just started the comprehensive construction of socialism according to the Soviet model. Due to the underdevelopment of socialist politics and economy, the shortcomings of the Soviet model were not prominently exposed, and the resulting contradictions were not as sharp as those in Soviet Eastern Europe. "We can only understand based on the conditions of our time, and we can only understand to what extent when these conditions reach a certain level." Given the development level at that time, although we could propose some preliminary reform ideas, it was still not enough to deeply understand the reform practices taking place in Soviet Eastern Europe and other countries. For example, to deeply understand the limitations of a highly centralized planned economy just established; to make people who had just experienced the three major transformations value the necessary supplementary role of individual economy to socialism and the certain positive role of market economy; to make those who had just relied on state power to establish the system of public ownership truly understand that it cannot be equated with direct state management of enterprises; and to let those who hadn't experienced the highly developed stage of commodity economy, but only gained knowledge about socialist commodity production from classic writers in books, deeply understand the significance of vigorously developing a commodity economy for socialism. It was not an easy task under the conditions at that time. Although there were some enlightened individuals within the party, they did not become the mainstream. It is precisely under this background that dogmatism, empiricism, and the role of traditional culture became prominent.
We started from the traditional model of reform but ended up on a more rigid path, one important reason being that the conditions for socialist reform (i.e. modernization of the model) were not yet mature. And a deeper reason is the lag in the modernization of Marxism.
III. The lag in the modernization of Marxism
The sinicization (localization) of Marxism inherently includes the modernization of Marxism. Only by achieving the modernization of Marxism can we scientifically achieve sinicization (localization). The so-called modernization of Marxism means combining Marxism with the development and characteristics of the current era. When Mao Zedong proposed the proposition and task of "sinicizing" Marxism at the Sixth Plenary Session of the party's Sixth Central Committee, he emphasized the national and regional characteristics, and also emphasized "flexible application according to Chinese characteristics," but did not particularly emphasize the characteristics of the times. Because at that time, it was still in the era of imperialism, war, and revolution as mentioned by Lenin, that is, the era had not changed yet. Therefore, "in the issue of applying and developing Marxism, the emphasis was on application; in the issue of the nationalization and modernization of Marxism, the emphasis was mainly on nationalization." After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, there have been significant changes in the times and themes. The prerequisite for sinicization of Marxism is the prominent issue of modernization. Unlike the first leap, the second leap of sinicization of Marxism must be achieved after the modernization of Marxism is solved. The twists and turns of the reform in socialist countries from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the direct reasons why China failed to achieve the second leap of sinicization of Marxism, mainly lie in the dogmatization of Marxism, and the deeper reason lies in not advancing the modernization of Marxism according to the changes of the times. The twists and turns of the model transformation are nothing but the outward manifestation of the theoretical development dilemma.
A traditional view holds that Marxism itself is a complete scientific system, and that subsequent development of it can only be within the existing framework, making partial developments, revisions, and enrichments on specific issues. This understanding narrows down the level, scope, and degree of development of Marxism, and weakens the urgency and importance of modernizing Marxism in the new era. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, out of certain strategic considerations, the term "sinicization of Marxism" was changed to "making Marxism concretized in China." Although there is no substantial difference between these two expressions, the term "concretized" can easily create an impression that under the conditions of significant changes in the era, the major historical task of sinicizing Marxism in China seems to be merely a matter of "concretization" or "specific application," and the basic principles (or general principles) of Marxism are only considered as static, unchanging, and solidified objects, often underemphasizing the issue of their contemporization under new historical conditions. In such understanding contexts, it is difficult to avoid dogmatism, to promote the cause of modernizing Marxism, and to accomplish the second leap of sinicization of Marxism.
Marxism is a multi-level theoretical framework. Among them, there is a highest level, a long-term stable and universally meaningful basic theoretical part, and a lower level, specific and less stable principles and categories. However, this distinction is often relative, because even some basic principles and methods have a problem of keeping up with the times. Some principles that were considered basic decades ago now only have relative significance. For example, some basic principles that were once considered self-evident regarding capitalism, socialism, planned economy, era characteristics, the working class, the bourgeoisie, etc., have obviously lost their universal explanatory power. Some philosophical and economic categories and principles that were once considered the most basic have also been proved to need development and supplementation. The difficulty lies in how to develop Marxism according to the needs of the times, in which levels, aspects, scope, and to what extent, in order to modernize it. How to determine the truthfulness of this development? In the theoretical framework of Marxism, "how much can change, how far it can deviate from its original premises, how much can still maintain an organic connection with the original theory, is a difficult question." Because, it is necessary to reconsider or modify Marxism to keep it closely connected to the environment, while maintaining knowledge or political connection with Marx's original doctrines or basic principles. "It is not always easy to coordinate these two needs", any bias may lead to dogmatism or nihilism. Therefore, people are increasingly inclined to accept a viewpoint proposed by Lukács in 1919 in his work "History and Class Consciousness": "The orthodoxy in Marxism only refers to the method. It is a scientific belief that dialectical Marxism is the correct research method, and this method can only be developed, expanded, and deepened in the direction laid down by its founder. Moreover, any attempt to overcome it or 'improve' it will only lead to shallowness, mediocrity, and compromise." In addition, a classic statement by Lenin cannot be ignored: "The time has passed for Russia to debate the socialist program based on books, and I am deeply convinced that it will never come back. Today, we can only discuss socialism based on experience." These understandings emphasize that Marxism should be developed and innovated on the basis of practice, keep up with the times, and help expand the space for the development of Marxism, avoiding restricting development to adjustments at the level of details and concrete aspects.
After the birth of Marxism, in the process of dissemination, practice, and development, significant changes have occurred while inheriting and continuing in a consistent manner. From a vertical perspective, Chinese scholars often divide this development into stages of Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, and stages represented by proletarian leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In the West, this division is even more numerous. For example, Mitchell Brodsky, a representative figure of Marxist sociology in the United States, divides the development of Marxism into three eras: the classical Marxist era, the national socialist era, and the socialist era with sociality. The third era of Marxism occurred from the mid-1970s to the present. Frederick Jameson, a famous postmodernist thinker in the United States, believes that different historical periods will produce different forms of Marxism. He divides the development of Marxism into three stages: the modernist stage, the imperialist stage, and the late capitalist stage.
From a horizontal perspective, in addition to leaders of proletarian revolution such as Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping who have had a significant impact on a global scale in the 20th century, it is also necessary to respect the contributions of figures such as Luxemburg, Lukács, Gramsci, as well as leaders of European communism and Western Marxism to the development of Marxism. For example, the "Western Marxism" that emerged in the 1920s and reached its peak in the 1950s and 1960s inherited and developed the Marxist tradition of criticizing capitalism in contemporary capitalist societies, breaking free from the dogmatism of the Soviet Union, and hoping to reread, interpret, and develop Marxism based on contemporary issues. They analyze various new characteristics and problems that arise in capitalist societies based on contemporary productive forces and scientific and technological foundations, predict the characteristics of future societies, and put forward various criticisms of the shortcomings and defects of the Soviet model. "Although it has differences or conflicts with the traditional concepts and developments of Marxism, and indeed contains deviations from certain fundamental principles of Marxism, it is still an undeniable aspect that has emerged in the development process of contemporary Marxism in the West, with a distinct sense of the times and reality." As long as one does not adopt an attitude of "I alone am the revolutionary" or "I alone am the Marxist," one will recognize the diversity in the development of Marxism. As Jameson emphasized, "We should not forget that Marxism now is not the only one, it has no monopoly, in fact, there are various Marxist theoretical discourses." This diversity brings vitality to Marxism, reflects its quality of keeping pace with the times, enables it to develop and enrich in various aspects, and meets the requirements of making Marxism contemporary in different aspects and to different degrees.
After World War II, with the changes of the times, the rapid development of science, technology, and productive forces, and the reform of socialism from the traditional mode to the contemporary mode, Marxism also faced a transformation from classical to contemporary, with its theme shifting from revolution and war to peace and construction. This is just like what Lenin did at the beginning of the 20th century, combining the Marxist classic theories with the characteristics of the era in the age of imperialism, making them contemporary.
The contemporization of Marxism can generally be divided into two levels. Firstly, with the development of the times and practice, on the basis of inheritance, there is the development of some original theories of the classical Marxist writers, which also includes changes and developments in their own understanding. This can be seen as the development at the level of basic theory. For example, the classical Marxist writers significantly developed many of their contents in the 1890s compared to the 1840s and 1850s; Lenin's understanding of socialism during the "war communism" and the New Economic Policy period showed obvious differences. On the other hand, starting from different backgrounds such as the characteristics of the times and the national conditions, Marxist theorists after Marx have different understandings, interpretations, and specific applications of the classical theories. This can be seen as the development at a relatively concrete level. Among the two, the former is obviously more fundamental. Without its contemporization, the work of regionalization and nationalization would have no basis to start on.
The times call for the contemporization of Marxism, but they have not prepared the corresponding conditions promptly. The various twists and turns in China's exploration from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the stagnation and even failures in the reform of socialist countries, to some extent, indicate that the conditions for breaking free from the serious constraints of dogmatism were not yet mature at that time; therefore, the transformation of socialism from the traditional mode to the modern mode and the transformation of Marxism from the classic to the contemporary were not yet mature, and they still needed the accumulation of practice, the exposure of contradictions, the lessons from mistakes, and the theoretical leap.
Mao Zedong was a great proletarian revolutionary and theorist with a strong sense of innovation. In the struggle against the dogmatization of Marxism and the deification of Soviet experience, he led the entire party to achieve the first leap in the sinification of Marxism. After the founding of New China, he continued to maintain this spirit of creativity and called on the whole party to develop Marxism on the basis of serious study of Marxism. He said, "Marxism must advance, it must develop with the development of practice, it cannot stagnate. If it stops and continues with the same old set, it will lose its vitality." He also said, "Any communist party in any country, any ideological field in any country, must create new theories, write new works, and produce its own theorists to serve the current political situation. Relying solely on the old ancestors is not enough." However, due to the lack of mature historical conditions, excessive reliance on the experience of wartime, and the influence of Chinese cultural traditions, Mao Zedong actually often limited this development within a certain range, that is, within the framework of some basic ideas about socialism proposed by classical writers at that time. In other words, he was still confined by some dogmatism and empiricism at a deeper level. This was a relatively common phenomenon in the international communist movement at that time, only with different forms. In this case, it was impossible to achieve the second leap in the sinification of Marxism. Since he still adhered to traditional views on the essential characteristics of socialism, public ownership, planned economy, commodity economy, and the times, it was impossible to talk about the correct reform of the Soviet model, and the task of the second leap in the sinification of Marxism was also difficult to accomplish. 
After 1976, based on summarizing the lessons, Deng Xiaoping led the entire party to uphold the banner of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and sharply put forward the task of making Marxism contemporary under new historical conditions. He said, "More than a hundred years have passed since Marx's death. What changes have occurred? How should we understand and develop Marxism under changing conditions? We have not figured it out yet." "We must not demand that Marx provide ready-made answers to the problems that have arisen in the hundreds of years after his death." "True Marxist-Leninists must, based on present circumstances, understand, inherit and develop Marxist-Leninist theory." "The world situation is changing rapidly, especially the rapid development of modern science and technology. One year now is equivalent to decades, even hundreds of years, in the old society. Those who do not inherit and develop Marxism with new ideas and perspectives are not true Marxists." On July 1, 2001, Jiang Zemin further pointed out in his speech at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, "We must adhere to the practice as the sole criterion for testing truth. Under the guidance of the party's basic theory, starting from reality, we must consciously free ourselves from the shackles of inappropriate concepts, practices, and systems, and free ourselves from the wrong and dogmatic understanding of Marxism." It is under the guidance of this ideology that the Communist Party of China has realized the transformation of Marxism from classical to contemporary, from traditional to contemporary socialist models, and achieved the second leap in the sinification of Marxism. 
Ⅳ. Extension and Preparation: The Features of the 29-year Sinification of Marxism 
From 1949 to 1978, the sinification of Marxism went through a tortuous process, oscillating between two leaps, with "extension" and "preparation" as its distinct characteristics.
The so-called extension mainly refers to the extension and development of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the theoretical achievement of the first leap. After the establishment of New China, the first generation of the Party Central Committee with Mao Zedong as the representative explored the process of China's own socialist construction and timely proposed the task of the second combination of Marxism and the Chinese reality. They conducted various explorations and made significant achievements and progress. Although there were various mistakes and the second leap was not realized, the theoretical achievements of the first leap, Mao Zedong Thought, continued to develop. This is manifested in the correct and relatively correct theoretical views, guiding principles, and policies formed by the Party in the process of exploring China's own path of socialist construction, as well as the accumulated correct and relatively correct practical experience.
The so-called "preparation" includes not only ideological and theoretical preparation as mentioned above, but also content in terms of material foundation. In the 29 years after the establishment of New China, under the leadership of the Party, the country achieved unprecedented political unity, established a strong central government that effectively controlled various levels of organizations and even the grassroots, built an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system, achieved and consolidated the unity of all ethnic groups nationwide, and built a party armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which has a high prestige and strong mobilization capacity. All these laid a strong material foundation for reform and opening up. In the exploration of nearly 30 years, whether it is achievements or detours, positive experiences or negative lessons, all have prepared the necessary conditions for the second leap.
As mentioned above, in the 1950s and 1960s, socialism modernization and contemporary Marxism were still in a tortuous exploration process worldwide. Although the task of socialist reform has been proposed, the goals of the reform are still unclear, and the theoretical and practical methods of the reform lack verification from both positive and negative practices, and the conditions for substantial progress are not mature. This can be seen from the "Cultural Revolution" in China in the 1960s and 1970s and the criticism of socialist market economy and the stagnation of reform in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Under the conditions of rapid development in technology, economy, and politics after the war, the task of contemporary Marxism became increasingly prominent, but it was severely constrained by orthodox dogmatism. The influence of this dogmatism is deep and wide, to the extent that after the fierce movement called "the comprehensive development of Marxism" during the "Cultural Revolution," China's new era actually began with a vehement political discussion on the philosophical common sense issue of "criteria of truth." At the beginning of China's reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping proposed the strategy of "not arguing," which was indeed considered because endless debates would only delay the opportunity for reform in the context where dogmatism still had a wide influence.
In such a specific historical stage, the explorations of socialist countries have a clear nature of trial and error, or it can be said that they are making necessary preparations for reforms in the form of trial and error. Regardless of the results, each attempt and practice has accumulated experience and lessons, narrowed the scope of exploration for later generations, brought understanding closer to the truth, and brought exploration closer to success. At the beginning of the reform, it can be said that people knew more about what should not be done than about what should be done. It is precisely because of such rich practical accumulation and preparation from both positive and negative aspects that the conditions for China's reform have matured, and the conditions for the second leap of Marxist sinicization have matured. The appearance of a significant push in the early stage of the reform and its relatively smooth development afterwards, as well as the introduction of a series of important reform ideas by Deng Xiaoping, obviously benefited from the maturity of conditions and sufficient preparation.
In 1962, Mao Zedong discussed the importance of Marxist Chinese publications such as "On New Democracy" during the period of democratic revolution and emphasized that they could only be produced during that time. Prior to that, there had not been significant upheavals, victories, failures, or sufficient experience to fully understand the laws of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong's approach is also applicable to the analysis and summarization of the 29-year process of Marxist sinicization after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

Chapter 2 The "Two Theories" of New Democracy
I. From the Theory of New Democratic Revolution to the Theory of New Democratic Society
1. Starting from the "Common Program"
On September 29, 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously passed the "Common Program" as the basic program for the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The "Common Program" embodies the basic ideas of the Communist Party of China regarding the state system and political system of the new China, as well as the planning for the future development of the new country. It is the result of the Communist Party of China integrating the universal truth of Marxism with China's actual conditions, and it is the crystallization of the first leap in the sinicization of Marxism, achieved through the creative application of Marxism to China's reality.
The "Common Program" stipulates:
"The People's Republic of China is a state of new democracy, that is, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants, which unites all democratic classes and all nationalities in China. It opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strives for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at various levels and the people's governments at various levels. The highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress. Democratic centralism is to be practiced in all levels of government."
"The People's Republic of China must abolish all privileges of imperialist countries in China, nationalize bureaucrat capitalism for the people, gradually change the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership to the land ownership of farmers, protect the state's public property and the property of cooperatives, protect the economic interests of workers, farmers, petite bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, as well as their private property, develop the people's economy of new democracy, and steadily transform the agricultural country into an industrial country."
"The fundamental policy of the economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to balance public and private interests, benefit both labor and capital, promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and facilitate internal and external exchanges. The goal is to develop production and prosper the economy. Various social and economic components are to be organized and collaborate under the leadership of state-owned economy, so that everyone gets what they deserve, in order to promote the development of the entire social economy."
The "Common Program" stipulates that state-owned economy is of a socialist nature and is the leading force of the entire social economy. Cooperative economy is of a semi-socialist nature, and the people's government should support its development and give preferential treatment. Private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the state and people's livelihood should be encouraged by the people's government to operate actively and supported in their development. The economy involved in the cooperation of state capital and private capital is of a state capitalism nature, and under necessary and possible conditions, private capital should be encouraged to develop towards state capitalism.
The "Common Program," guided by the theory of new democratic society, is a program for building a new democratic country. The basic provisions regarding the politics and economy of New China are the most important theoretical achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in the long-term democratic revolution, combining the universal truth of Marxism with the specific national conditions of China and successfully realizing the first leap of the sinicization of Marxism. It has developed the basic principles of Marxism, going beyond the Soviet model, in terms of new democratic revolution, new democratic society and its socialist direction, the national system and political system of the new democratic state, implementing ethnic regional autonomy within a unitary state, individual economy and capitalist economy, petite bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie. This process of theory formation and development is the process of sinicization of Marxism.
2. The Proposal of the New Democratic Socialism
Understanding the bourgeois democratic revolution, understanding the Chinese bourgeoisie, determining the nature of the state to be established after the victory of the Chinese revolution, and understanding the socialist future of the Chinese revolution are fundamental questions of the Chinese revolution. They are also fundamental questions of socialist revolution and construction in China, as well as key factors in achieving Marxist sinicization. On this issue, the Party went through a tortuous exploration process. A systematic and correct answer to this question began with a series of important works by Mao Zedong.
In "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," Mao Zedong repeatedly expounded that the bourgeois democratic revolution in China in the first half of the 20th century was no longer the old-style general bourgeois democratic revolution, but a new and special bourgeois democratic revolution, namely the New Democratic Revolution. This kind of democratic revolution is different from the old-style bourgeois democratic revolution. It is led by the proletarian party and serves as the premise for the establishment of socialism. China's revolution is divided into two stages, and its society must go through this revolution in order to further develop into a socialist society. Mao Zedong's ideas directly inherited the discussions of Marxist-Leninist theory on bourgeois democratic revolution in colonial and semi-colonial societies. In his own words, it is "based on the theory of Stalin." For example, the nature of the bourgeois democratic revolution, the proletariat in countries where the tasks of the democratic revolution have not been completed must take the democratic revolution as the first step in advancing the socialist revolution, the Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution, it is already "part of the new socialist revolution," the revolution should not stop, and after the victory of the democratic revolution, it must continue to strive for the victory of the socialist revolution, and the proletariat must strive to maintain the leadership of the democratic revolution, and so on.
Starting from the reality of China, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists successfully applied the general principles of Marxist-Leninist bourgeois democratic revolution in the 20th century to the special historical conditions of the Chinese revolution, forming the theory and practice of the New Democratic Revolution with Chinese characteristics, and achieving the first historical leap in the sinicization of Marxism. This is one of the theoretical essence of the Communist Party of China's promotion of the sinicization of Marxism in the New Democratic Revolution.
It is worth noting that in these two works, especially in "On New Democracy", Mao Zedong not only discusses and analyzes the new democratic revolution, but also provides a general theoretical and relatively complete description of the form and nature of the new society established after the revolutionary victory, clearly putting forward the slogan of establishing the "New Democratic Republic". He points out that the goal and result of the new democratic revolution is to establish a new democratic society. The economic characteristics of this society are that "large banks, large industries, and large businesses are owned by the state of this republic", and that "the state-owned economy under the leadership of the proletariat in the New Democratic Republic is of a socialist nature, and is the leading force of the entire national economy. However, this republic does not confiscate other capitalist private property, nor does it prohibit the development of capitalist production that "cannot control the livelihood of the nation".
The basic characteristics of this new society in terms of politics are that it "is definitely not and cannot establish a capitalist dictatorship of the Chinese bourgeoisie, but rather to establish a new democratic society with the proletarian class as the leader and the various revolutionary classes in China united in a dictatorship". The national body of the New Democratic Republic, that is, the status of the various classes in society and their political characteristics, "can only be a democratic republic under the united dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people led by the proletariat. This is the new democratic republic, which is also the new Three People's Principles republic of genuine revolution". This new democratic republic is different from the old democratic republic on the one hand and from the Soviet-style socialist republic on the other. It is a "new democratic republic", a "united dictatorship of all revolutionary classes", a "transitional form", and an "indispensable and necessary form".
The future of this new society is that after the revolutionary victory, "because the obstacles to the development of capitalism have been eliminated, the capitalist economy will have a considerable degree of development in Chinese society", and "this is the inevitable result of economically backward China after the victory of the democratic revolution". "But this is only one aspect of the Chinese revolution, not its entire result. The entire result of the Chinese revolution is: on the one hand, the development of capitalist factors, and on the other hand, the development of socialist factors. "With the development of socialist factors and favorable international circumstances, it is very likely that the final result of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution will avoid the future of capitalism and achieve the future of socialism".
If Mao Zedong's theory on the new democratic revolution focuses more on the specific application of Marxist democratic revolution theory, then his discussion on the future forms of the new democratic society in terms of politics, economy, culture, and so on, and his vision of the new social forms to be achieved through revolution, are more based on the actual situation in China and develop the theory of the transition from a backward country to a socialist society according to Marxism. Moreover, since the mid-1940s, the content of the new democratic society in Mao Zedong's writings and those of other leaders of the Party has continued to expand.
In April 1945, Mao Zedong delivered a political report titled "On the United Front Government" on behalf of the central committee at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party. With the impending victory in the war against Japan and the establishment of a united front government ahead of the Party, and with the successful practice of over a decade of revolutionary base areas, "On the United Front Government" not only clarified and expanded upon certain basic points from "On New Democracy," such as the relationship between new democracy and socialism, and how to deal with capitalism in a new democratic country, but also made them more concrete. Although some content emphasizing the significance of a certain degree of development of capitalism for a new democratic country, as well as the attitude of the new state towards capitalism, was removed from the 1952 edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," it does not affect the overall ideas of the report.
Regarding the new state system, Mao Zedong pointed out, "We advocate the establishment of a state system based on the democratic alliance of the overwhelming majority of the people nationwide under the leadership of the working class after thoroughly defeating the Japanese invaders," that is, the "state system of new democracy." Regarding the relationship between new democracy and socialism, Mao Zedong famously said, "Only through democracy can we achieve socialism. This is the logical conclusion of Marxism."
Compared to works such as "On New Democracy," during this period Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Party, when discussing the characteristics of new democratic society, also emphasized its connection to the development of productive forces to a certain degree, in other words, they emphasized its material basis. On May 22, 1944, Mao Zedong gave a speech at a reception held for representatives of factory directors and workers attending a conference hosted by the Central Office at the Central Party School Auditorium in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He said, "Regarding economic work, especially industry, we still don't understand it well, but it is the crucial factor that determines everything, it determines military, political, cultural, ideological, moral, and religious matters, it determines social change." Three months later, Mao Zedong pointed out in a letter, "The basis of new democratic society is factories (social production, both public-owned and private-owned) and cooperatives (including work teams), not scattered individual economy. The scattered individual economy – household agriculture and cottage industry – is the basis of feudal society, not the basis of democratic society (includes old democracy, new democracy, socialism). This is the difference between Marxism and populism. In simple terms, the basis of new democratic society is machinery, not manual labor. We haven't acquired machinery yet, so we haven't achieved victory. If we can never acquire machinery, we can never achieve victory, and we will perish. The current countryside is a temporary base area, and it is not and cannot be the main basis of Chinese democratic society. Transforming the social basis from an agricultural society to an industrial society is precisely our revolutionary task." In his explanation of "On the United Front Government" at the Seventh National Congress in 1945, Mao Zedong also stated that after the development of new democracy, a transition to socialism would follow. This is the difference between us and populism, which had a significant influence within our Party. The report also developed "On New Democracy" by determining the need for extensive development of capitalism. Extensive development of capitalism is harmless and beneficial under the new democratic regime. Mao Zedong's emphasis on the material basis of the new democratic society is essentially an emphasis on the Marxist principle of the determinant role of productive forces.
At the time, Mao Zedong believed that economically and culturally backward China must go through a considerable period of constructing new democracy, vigorously developing the economy and culture, and improving social productive forces. In this process of development, the socialist component of the economy gradually increases, while private capitalist economy, although it also develops to a certain degree, continuously decreases in proportion and gradually comes under the national planning. Individual economy in agriculture and other sectors gradually transitions to a path of mutual assistance and cooperative production. After achieving the goals of industrialization and agricultural collectivization, major socialist steps can be taken to realize the transformation towards a socialist society.
It is based on a scientific understanding of the material foundation of the new democratic society that Mao Zedong was able to have a scientific understanding of capitalism and the bourgeoisie in the new democratic country. He pointed out, "Replacing foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism with a certain development of capitalism is not only a progress, but also an inevitable process. It is not only beneficial to the bourgeoisie, but also more beneficial to the proletariat, or to be more precise, it is more beneficial to the proletariat." "Now China has gained not only foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism, but not yet enough capitalism. On the contrary, our capitalism is too little." "Under the system of new democratic society, in addition to the state's own economy, the individual economy of the working people and the cooperative economy, private capitalist economy must be allowed to develop within the limits that it cannot manipulate the national livelihood in order to benefit the development of society." "Under the system of new democratic society, policies will be adopted to regulate the interests between labor and capital." "On the one hand, protect the interests of workers," "On the other hand, ensure that state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and cooperative enterprises can make legitimate profits under reasonable operation; make both public and private, labor and capital work together for the development of industrial production."
II. Initial Exploration of New Democratic Society
1. Planning of New China at the September 1948 Meeting
Under the situation of continuous victory in the liberation war, there were rapid and fundamental changes in the domestic political, military, and class forces. The Communist Party of China has become the decisive force determining China's future development, and the task of building a new country is more urgently placed before the Communist Party of China. Driven by practice, the Communist Party of China's theory of new democratic revolution has been constantly developing and maturing, and the central committee of the party can no longer be satisfied with a general description of the future new society. As Mao Zedong said, "The development of the Chinese revolution for 20 years after the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen has greatly developed the theory, program, and practice of our party's new democratic revolution, and will continue to have greater development in the future." Based on the fundamental changes in the balance of forces, the party has made new thinking on issues such as national politics and economy, and has developed some thoughts and strategies from the past. This became particularly prominent in the second half of 1948.
In September 1948, the Central Committee of the Party held a Politburo meeting in Xibaipo. In addition to reviewing and summarizing the progress and experience of the liberation war, the meeting also "systematically" discussed the construction of New China and put the task of establishing New China on the agenda. It was at this meeting that the Central Committee of the Party clearly and accurately planned the blueprint of the new democratic society.
In his report, Mao Zedong elaborated on the class nature of the upcoming regime, namely the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, with the participation of democratic elements of the bourgeoisie. Regarding the nature of the new democratic society, Mao Zedong revised the previous view of "new democracy" or "new capitalism" based on the practice in the anti-Japanese base areas. Based on the comparison of class and political forces in the later stage of the liberation war, the rapid expansion of the liberated areas and the accumulation of practical experience, Mao Zedong pointed out that the term "new capitalism" was not appropriate because it did not explain that state-owned and public-owned economies, which were under the leadership of the proletariat, played a decisive role in our social economy and therefore all these economies had a socialist nature. Based on this, he stated, "The name of our social economy is still 'new democracy'." In the conclusion of the meeting, he summarized the main contradictions in the new democratic society as follows: "After the completion of the bourgeois democratic revolution, the main contradiction within China is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, while externally it is the contradiction with imperialism."
In his speech at the meeting, Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Central Committee, elaborated in detail on the issue of "how to build the new democratic economic system" that would soon be faced. According to the spirit of "On the United Front Government", Liu Shaoqi pointed out that it was precisely because the modern machine industry in our country was "very small in quantity" that socialist revolution could not be immediately implemented after the victory of the revolution. "The overall national economy is called the new democratic economy," which "includes natural economy, small-scale production economy, capitalist economy, semi-socialist economy, state capitalist economy, and state-owned socialist economy," with state-owned socialist economy as the leading component.
It is worth noting that Liu Shaoqi not only pointed out the basic contradictions of the new democratic economy in his speech, but also insightfully discussed the specific ways to solve these contradictions. "In the new democratic economy, the basic contradiction is the contradiction between capitalism and socialism." The way to resolve this contradiction is "economic competition", which is long-term, comprehensive, and "peaceful competition". There is a question of "who will win over whom" in this competition. "If we win the competition, the revolution can peacefully transform." Therefore, although "we cannot adopt socialist policies too early, we should not underestimate the contradiction between the proletarian working people and the bourgeoisie, and we should soberly see this contradiction." In this kind of economy, on the one hand, we must develop private capitalism that benefits the national economy, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to the struggle between private capitalism and socialist economy. He demanded that the whole Party have a clear mind, be good at managing the economy, and be good at peacefully competing with capitalist economy, otherwise "we will fail and the proletariat's leadership over the country will be overthrown".
Mao Zedong expressed the same opinions as Liu Shaoqi at the meeting. He pointed out in his interruptive remarks during Liu Shaoqi's speech that the state power established after the revolution is not the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the dictatorship of the working class and the peasantry, which is decided by the cooperation between the proletariat and the broad masses of producers. It is "the political power of new bourgeois democracy, the new democratic dictatorship", which contains socialist elements and components in its politics, economy, and culture. When Liu Shaoqi mentioned that "adopting socialist policies prematurely is unacceptable," Mao Zedong interjected, "When should we launch the full-scale offensive? Maybe fifteen years after the nationwide victory." When discussing the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the new democratic economy, Mao Zedong said, "Struggle takes two forms: competition and confiscation. We need competition now, but we don't need confiscation yet." He also said, "If we only talk about competing with capitalism, it won't solve the problem. There is still the issue of utilizing it for the development of production." It should be said that the statements made by Liu Shaoqi and Mao Zedong about the new democratic economy and its fundamental contradictions are correct. Particularly, their forward-looking and distinctive views on the "methods of struggle" are highly innovative.
2. The Unfolding of the Thoughts on New Democratic Society
Due to the development of practice and deep exploration, the party's theory of new democratic society rapidly matured during this period. In September 1948, Liu Shaoqi also discussed the social composition of the new democratic economy in more concrete terms in his article "On the Economy and Cooperatives in New Democracy." It includes the state economy, cooperative economy, and private capitalist economy. He emphasized that since China is still a country with a predominance of small-scale production and an agricultural country, it is necessary to use commercial relations to connect the millions of scattered and independent small producers and link them with large-scale industry. In the entire economic system of new democracy, the cooperative economy should occupy an important position. He also mentioned, "Under the social system of new democracy, there still exists a significant proportion of private capitalist economy in the national economy. This kind of economy will continue to develop in the future, and to some extent, its development is necessary, beneficial, and not fearful." Liu Shaoqi's thoughts were "clearly influenced by Lenin's ideas of implementing the New Economic Policy, but he also added his understanding of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution."
At this time, September 15, 1948, Zhang Wentian expressed similar opinions to the September Conference in a report titled "Outline on the Economic Composition and Basic Principles of Economic Construction in Northeast China" (hereinafter referred to as "Outline") submitted by the Northeast Bureau to the central government. At that time, Northeast China was already the largest liberated area in the country, with the most cities in all the liberated areas and the strongest industrial strength, accumulating a wealth of experience in economic construction on a large scale. Therefore, the "Outline" was able to discuss in more detail the five economic components of the new democratic economic policy, namely state-owned economy, cooperative economy, state capitalism, private capitalism, and small commodity economy, than Liu Shaoqi's conception. The "Outline" pointed out that state-owned economy already accounted for a large proportion of the total production in Northeast China and controlled the lifeline of the social economy, occupying a leading position in the national economy; "This kind of economy operated by the new democratic country under the leadership of the proletariat is already a socialist economy"; "This is the most valuable asset of the state", "Its development prospects are infinite". Regarding the cooperative economy, it is "the most reliable and powerful assistant of the state-owned economy under the system of new democratic rule led by the proletariat in various degrees with a bureaucratic nature". Regarding state capitalism, it is "a form of capitalism that is most conducive to the development of the new democratic economy", and we should "consciously promote and organize it" to make it "a favorable direction in the development of private capitalism". Regarding private capitalism, due to the limited strength of state-owned economy at that time, underdeveloped cooperative economy, the needs of war and the people, and the development of free trade, "the existence of private capitalism is inevitable and necessary to a certain extent"; "It must not be ignored or prematurely restricted by measures that are still beneficial to national economy and people's livelihood". Regarding the small commodity economy, "this economy is mainly the small commodity economy of farmers". It "will also need to develop towards socialism under the system of new democratic rule led by the proletariat". After a specific analysis of various economic components, Zhang Wentian concluded: "In general, all of the above-mentioned five economic components should be developed now, but in the process of development, we must implement a clear leadership line of the proletariat in economic policies." This is: "Take the development of the state-owned economy as the main body, extensively develop and closely rely on the cooperative economy of the masses, support and transform the small commodity economy, allow and encourage the private capitalism that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, especially the state capitalism, prevent and oppose the speculative and destructive nature inherent in commodity capitalism, prohibit and combat all the harmful speculative manipulation of operations that are detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood." "Only by implementing this line can we smoothly develop the economy of the new democratic society and strengthen the socialist component in the new democratic economy."
The report drafted by Zhang Wentian on the Northeast Bureau has received attention and recognition from the Party Central Committee. From October to December 1948, Liu Shaoqi made several modifications to this report. In the modifications, he wrote: the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is the fundamental contradiction in the new democratic society; the struggle on this contradiction, especially the long-term economic competition on this contradiction, "will determine the future development prospects of the new democratic society." He pointed out that the distinctive feature of the new democratic economy, compared to ordinary capitalist economy, lies in its organization and planning, "but in implementing this organization and planning of the national economy, it must be strictly limited to the necessary and possible extent, and it must be gradually realized," "a fully or excessively high or wide-ranging planned economy cannot be implemented." Therefore, "when criticizing and opposing the petty-bourgeois or bourgeois line, we must resolutely and closely guard against any acute tendency of 'Left' adventurism, that is, adopting socialist steps prematurely and excessively in the national economy, exceeding practical possibilities and necessities to mechanically implement planned economy, thus losing the support of the small peasant producers. This is an extremely dangerous 'Left' deviation, which we must strictly guard against."
It is worth noting that Liu Shaoqi also specifically proposed the idea of using "economic means" for construction. He pointed out that revolutionary methods, namely administrative measures, can be used to eliminate feudalism, but it is necessary to economically lead and guide farmers and small producers, "using such administrative measures would be completely ineffectual and very dangerous. The proletariat must adopt economic means that farmers and small producers can accept in order to organize and lead them economically."
After the September Conference, the Party's thinking on new democratic society rapidly developed in a comprehensive and in-depth direction. On December 25, 1948, in his report to the North China Finance and Economics Committee, Liu Shaoqi provided a more systematic discussion on the nature of the economy in New China. He said, "the current revolutionary target of attack is still imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; private capitalism is not our main objective of struggle." "Politically, we establish a united front government and continue to incorporate the bourgeoisie." "After the revolutionary victory, capitalism will develop, and this limited development is nothing for us to fear. However, it cannot be without restrictions; without restrictions, it is terrifying." "Allowing capitalist development that benefits the national economy and people's livelihood is a slogan for struggle. Our policy is not to develop capitalism, but to restrict capitalism and transition to socialism."
"Our regime is of the nature of new democracy, and the economy is still of the new democratic type. Is the new democratic economy capitalist or socialist? It is neither. It has elements of both socialism and capitalism. This is a unique historical form, and its characteristic is the transitional period of the economy, which can transition to capitalism or socialism. This is an unresolved issue. The transitional nature cannot exist for a long time, but it has a considerable duration." "After overthrowing the Kuomintang, we retain the bourgeoisie for a period of time, sincerely developing it within fifteen years, which is beneficial to the proletariat."
During this period, the relevant discussions of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, etc., developed the concepts of "On New Democracy" and "On United Front" for the envisioning of the new society after the revolutionary victory, preparing adequately for the upcoming 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Party.
III. The basic formation of the theory of building a new democratic country
1. The 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Party
In March 1949, the 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Party was held. This meeting, held on the eve of the victory of the new democratic revolution, was a very important conference to determine the basic principles and policies after the revolutionary victory. Mao Zedong stated in his report at the meeting, "From now on, we are entering a period that transitions from the cities to the countryside and from the cities leading the countryside. The party's work focus should shift from the countryside to the cities," and the entire party "must make great efforts to learn to manage and develop cities."
Mao Zedong pointed out that we have conducted extensive economic construction work, and the party's economic policies have been implemented in practical work. "However, there are many confused ideas within the party on why such economic policies should be adopted instead of other economic policies in terms of theory and principles. How should we answer this question? We believe that we should answer it in this way."
"The proportion of industry and agriculture in China's national economy, in terms of the whole country, was about 10% for modern industry and about 90% for agriculture and handicrafts before the Anti-Japanese War." "This is the economic manifestation of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of old China, and it is also the basic starting point for all problems during the period of the Chinese revolution and a considerable period of time after the revolution." He also mentioned that China has about 90% backward and scattered individual agricultural economy and handicraft economy, "which is backward and not much different from ancient times, and about 90% of our economic life is still stuck in ancient times." "Anyone who neglects or underestimates this will commit the error of 'left' opportunism." This is the "basic starting point for all problems during the period of the Chinese revolution and a considerable period of time after the revolution. From this starting point, a series of strategic, tactical, and policy issues have arisen in our party."
Based on this basic point, he pointed out, "Because China's economy is still backward now, for a considerable period of time after the revolution, we still need to make full use of the enthusiasm of urban and rural capitalism to facilitate the development of the national economy"; "During this period, all urban and rural capitalist elements that are not harmful to the national economy but beneficial to it should be allowed to exist and develop." "If we think that we should impose excessive and rigid restrictions on private capital, or if we think that private capital can be quickly eliminated, this is completely wrong. This is the view of 'left' opportunism or adventurism." "Regarding the issue of restoring and developing production, it must be determined: firstly, the production of state-owned industry; secondly, the production of private industry; and thirdly, the production of handicrafts." Mao Zedong's classic statements adhere to the most basic productivity standards of Marxism, criticize the idea of directly entering socialism without taking into account China's national conditions, and draw a clear line between those seemingly "revolutionary" but closely related to populism.
Another important aspect of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee is the analysis of the basic contradictions in new China. Mao Zedong pointed out in the report: "After the victory of the Chinese revolution throughout the country, and after the land problem was solved, there still exist two basic contradictions in China. The first one is internal, namely the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The second one is external, namely the contradiction between China and imperialist countries." This analysis indicates the two basic points that the party must pay attention to in all its work. However, this judgment raises several questions.
For example, when the People's Republic of China was established, two-thirds of the country still had a feudal land system. This means that although the New Democratic Revolution had achieved victory, its economic agenda had not been fully implemented. So, during the time from the establishment of the New China to the completion of land reform in the new areas, what was the main contradiction within the country?
Another example is the need to "make the best possible use of the enthusiasm of urban and rural capitalism." It is stated that "all urban and rural capitalist elements that are not harmful but beneficial to the national economy should be allowed to exist and develop." At the same time, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie is identified as the "fundamental contradiction." How should the relationship between these two be handled?
Furthermore, Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized in the report that all work in the cities "revolves around the central task of production and serves this central task." So, how should this "central task" be unified with the "fundamental contradiction"?
The emergence of this situation may be as Hu Sheng said, "At that time, there was still some hesitation, and there was indeed some contradiction in thinking." On one hand, there was a deep understanding of the Chinese national conditions and the application of Marxist theory of productive forces. On the other hand, there was an understanding of Marxist theory of socialism and the reference to the experiences of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Both of these factors had a significant impact on the Chinese Communists of that time. The emergence of these problems indicates the development of practice and the deepening of knowledge, as well as the challenges in exploration.
After the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the Party's exploration of the basic issues related to the theory and policies of building a new democratic country was further deepened.
In April 1949, Ren Bishi stated in his report at the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League that in order for China to achieve complete economic independence, it is necessary not only to strive for the restoration of the destroyed industry within three to five years, but also to plan for the industrial proportion in the national economy to rise from around 10% to 30%-40% within ten to fifteen years. "This lays a solid economic foundation for the future transition to socialism." In May of the same year, Li Lisan, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in a speech, "The characteristic of China is that its economic development is far behind". "So China not only cannot carry out socialist revolution directly like Russia at that time, but also cannot transition to socialism like the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe did a few years after the revolution." After the victory of the Chinese Revolution, "it is still necessary to go through a relatively long period of new democratic construction to develop China's industry". "Without the significant development of industry, not only can socialism not be implemented, but also China's national economic independence from imperialism cannot be truly and thoroughly achieved."
Three months later, on June 30, 1949, Mao Zedong reiterated the above-mentioned ideas in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in commemoration of the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. "Who are the people? In China, at the present stage, they are the working class, the peasant class, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. These classes, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, unite and form their own country." "On this basis, it is possible for China to steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party." "The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie," "The transition from the new democratic to the socialist society mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes." "The national bourgeoisie is of great significance at the present stage." "In order to counter the oppression of imperialism and to raise the backward economic status, China must make use of all capitalistic factors in urban and rural areas that are beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy and the livelihood of the people, and unite with the national bourgeoisie to struggle together. Our current policy is to regulate capitalism rather than eliminate it. However, the national bourgeoisie cannot play the role of revolutionary leaders, nor should it occupy a dominant position in the state power."
Before the founding of New China, not only was the Party's theory of new democratic revolution well developed and complete, but also the theory of building a new democratic country and the theory of new democratic society were basically mature. The development and maturation of the "Two Theories" of new democratic revolution is a process of development and maturation of the Sinicization of Marxism.
2. The Model of Practicing the Theory of New Democratic Society: Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech"
With the continuous victories in the liberation war, many large and medium-sized cities were successively liberated, and a large number of cadres who had long been active in backward rural areas entered the cities to undertake the tasks of receiving and managing them. Due to the rapid victory, the cadres were lacking in ideological and policy preparation, and the "left" mistakes emerged in the management of the cities, which were very detrimental to the implementation of the Party's policy guidelines, the rapid recovery of urban production, and the stability of people's hearts.
After the liberation of Tianjin in early 1949, social order was quickly restored, but production recovery was slow. In addition to the damage caused by the war, the failure to handle the relationship between public and private, and the labor-capital relationship was an important reason. There was a common wait-and-see sentiment among capitalists. Bo Yibo recalled, "Workers and clerks mistakenly thought that we allowed factory branches and conducted liquidation struggles. Within a month of the liberation of Tianjin, there were fifty-three liquidation struggles." "The capitalists had three fears in their minds: fear of liquidation, fear that the Communist Party only cares about the interests of workers, and fear of inability to control workers and inability to produce in the future." "Therefore, they held a passive waiting and watching attitude, and even went to Hong Kong. According to Tianjin's statistics, private enterprises at that time had a work resumption rate of less than 30%." The party organization in Tianjin also lacked effective methods in implementing policies regarding private capital. The seriousness of the problem was also prevalent in the urban areas of the newly liberated regions. Whether these problems could be correctly and quickly resolved in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee was related to the stability and consolidation of the People's political power. According to the decision of the central leadership, Liu Shaoqi went to Tianjin in April 1949 to address the issue of quickly restoring urban production. After in-depth and extensive discussions and investigations, Liu Shaoqi delivered a series of important speeches in Tianjin. These speeches profoundly and vividly expounded the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, promoted the ideology of building a new democratic society, clarified the party's policy towards the national bourgeoisie, and effectively corrected the "left" mistakes that had emerged in urban work at that time, playing a significant role in stabilizing the situation and restoring and developing production.
In his speech, Liu Shaoqi said that capitalists are not the targets of the working class struggle anymore, but rather the objects to be united and fought for. The emphasis today is on uniting the bourgeois class, rather than focusing on the struggle. In response to the problems in Tianjin's work, he said: Chairman Mao once said that we must consider issues comprehensively, taking into account all aspects such as the public-private relations, labor-capital relations, urban-rural relations, and internal-external relations. He cited Mao Zedong's statement during a conversation with representatives of the Shanghai business community in the first half of 1949, emphasizing that revolution is the primary goal of the proletariat. However, when it comes to production in the city, it should be the primary concern of the capitalists.
"Is the New Democratic Economy a form of capitalism? Or is it a form of socialism? It is neither. It contains elements of both socialism and capitalism. It is a unique historical form, characterized as a transitional period economy that can transition towards capitalism or towards socialism." "The transitional nature cannot exist indefinitely, but it does last for a considerable period." "Why don't we eliminate the bourgeoisie earlier? Because it is much more difficult to do so. What happens after it is eliminated? You still need to invite it back." Therefore, "after we overthrow the Kuomintang, we will preserve the bourgeoisie for a certain period and sincerely develop it within fifteen years, which is beneficial to the proletariat."
Liu Shaoqi specifically analyzed the state of capitalism in China at the time: "The exploitative system of capitalism cannot be completely abolished today." "The suffering of workers today is not caused by the development of capitalism, but rather by the lack of development of capitalism. Under the current conditions in China, the development of private capitalism is progressive, beneficial to the national economy, beneficial to China, and beneficial to the workers." "Exploitation under certain historical conditions has its progressiveness." "Today, the exploitation of capitalism in our country is not only not evil, but also has its merits. After feudal exploitation is removed, capitalist exploitation is progressive. The problem today is not that there are too many factories and too many workers being exploited, but rather that there are too few." "The contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie cannot be fundamentally resolved today, but can only be eased to some extent."
Liu Shaoqi's Tianjin speech dispelled many concerns among the cadres at the time and clarified some ambiguous understandings. Although certain language may have been exaggerated, overall, it accurately expounded the Party's policy towards the national bourgeoisie and specifically elucidated the basic economic policies of the New Democratic State. Its most brilliant point lies in approaching the subject matter from the perspective of productivity standards, rather than abstract ideological standards or abstract moral evaluations. Following Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech," industrial and commercial production in Tianjin began to recover from May onwards, and by June and July, major industrial sectors had recovered to pre-liberation levels. In September, the number of privately-owned industrial and commercial establishments approved for operation increased from 293 in April to 3,800, with an increase in the number of workers by nearly 20%. The rapid revival of industry and commerce in Tianjin marked a flourishing scene of economic development. The "Tianjin Speech" set an example for the entire Party in correctly handling a series of issues after taking over the cities.
3. "On the Economic Construction Policy of New China"
In June 1949, in order to go to Moscow for talks with leaders of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Liu Shaoqi wrote a report outline entitled "On the Economic Construction Policy of New China" based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and exchanged views with other major leaders of the Central Committee. The outline provides a more systematic, accurate, and standardized explanation of the economic components and their interrelationships after the establishment of New China, and introduces the upcoming comprehensive economic construction based on this. The outline ranks the five economic components as follows: state-owned economy, cooperative economy, state capitalist economy, private capitalist economy, small commodity economy, and semi-natural economy. The nature of the five economic components is as follows: the state-owned economy of the new democratic country under the leadership of the proletariat is a socialist economy, the cooperative economy is an economy with socialist characteristics to varying degrees, the state capitalist economy is an economy very close to socialism, and the private capitalist economy, small commodity economy, and semi-natural economy are the foundation of the development trend of capitalism. Based on the above analysis, the outline believes that "in the current period and the initial period after the war, in order to urgently heal the wounds of the war and restore the damaged and isolated economic life, in general, except for speculative and harmful operations that are detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood in the new democratic country, all the aforementioned five economic components should be encouraged to develop." Among them, "the development of the state-owned economy should be the main focus".
Another important content of the outline is the analysis and identification of the "basic internal contradictions in New China after the elimination of imperialist forces and feudal forces". The outline reiterates the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "This is the struggle between the socialist factors and trends and the capitalist factors and trends, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." "This contradiction and struggle will determine whether China's future development will ultimately transition to a socialist society or a capitalist society?" The outline believes that the new democratic economy will be a transitional economy. "This transition will be a long-term, intense and arduous struggle process, which is what Lenin called the problem of 'who will win' during the period of the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union."
This outline, prepared on the eve of the establishment of New China, reflects the mature concept of nation-building formed through 29 years of democratic revolution. Compared with the previous statements of the central leaders, it clarifies the main contradictions after the establishment of New China, emphasizes the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and is more cautious in terms of the development and utilization of capitalism, with less emphasis on its importance than in works such as "On the United Front Government" and "On New Democracy." "Although it still maintains the concept of New Democracy, it seems different from when discussing the United Front Government." Furthermore, the outline equates the new democratic economy with Lenin's New Economic Policy and equates the period of New Democracy with the "transition period" mentioned by Lenin, which is different from works such as "On New Democracy." This can be seen as a retreat from the position of works such as "On the United Front Government" or as an understanding that develops with the development of practice.
It is understandable that this situation has occurred. Simply put, absolute regression or absolute development is not desirable. Firstly, before the establishment of New China, there had been fundamental changes in the domestic political and military situation. The Communist Party of China and the revolutionary classes led by it had become the overwhelming force. Under such circumstances, it is understandable that there would be new developments and new understandings regarding the bourgeoisie, the new democratic revolution, and the construction of a new democratic society in the new practice. Secondly, in the process of restoring the national economy, the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the state-owned economy and the capitalist economy, will gradually become prominent. It is much more complex to correctly handle these contradictions at the practical level than to argue about them theoretically. Furthermore, with the expansion of large-scale economic work, the experiences of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe have had increasing influence. The influence of the Soviet construction model has also been gradually strengthened.
Ultimately, these issues revolve around how to handle the relationship between socialism and capitalism, and between the proletariat and the national bourgeoisie in a new democratic country. Regarding this issue, based on more than twenty years of struggle and practice, the party had already gained experiences from the revolutionary base area during the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the experience from the anti-Japanese democratic base area during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as the experiences of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe after World War II. The party also had theoretical guidance from Lenin's theory of the New Economic Policy, the theory of the transitional period, and Stalin's relevant theories. However, despite the rapid victory, there was still a lack of comprehensive practice. Many contradictions remained unresolved when dealing with a large number of specific policies. It is precisely against this background that some inconsistencies and incompleteness arose in theory. For example, in the article "The Nature of China's Economy and the Economic Construction Policy of New China," Liu Shaoqi compared China with the Soviet Union in terms of economics, politics, and international relations. He emphasized the combination of China's national conditions and the unity of building a people's democratic state. He also pointed out that the Soviet experience should not be mechanically applied. While the Soviet Union did not implement state capitalism, we did. Some say, "Since the Soviet Union did not implement this system, we do not need to implement it either." However, "China's situation is different." Our conditions are better than the Soviet Union's, and most importantly, "our revolution has not yet opposed the bourgeoisie, and to a certain extent, we have united with them and will continue to do so."
However, there are also aspects of mechanical application. For example, after comparing the New Economic Policy with the new economic policy of new democracy, Liu Shaoqi pointed out, "Lenin said, what is the New Economic Policy? The New Economic Policy is the fierce class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The economic policy of new democracy is the policy of sharp class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and it is the final struggle. The later it goes, the more intense the struggle becomes. When the bourgeoisie becomes more desperate, it becomes more resistant, more ruthless, and we must be vigilant." Later practice proved that these two have aspects that can be compared, but also aspects that cannot be compared. Both the New Economic Policy and the economic policy of new democracy are based on the basic national conditions of backward countries, utilizing capitalism for economic development. However, how much to utilize, how long to utilize, and how to handle the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between socialism and capitalism during utilization, are not only open to different theoretical interpretations, but also difficult to grasp in practical work. Moreover, due to different national conditions, countries may have considerable differences in their approaches. This issue is a test for socialist countries after the war, as to whether they can combine the basic principles of Marxism with their specific circumstances.
Although these situations have arisen, the party's basic understanding of the new democratic society, the new democratic economy, etc. remains consistent throughout. For example, despite clarifying the fundamental contradiction, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, etc. still maintain a positive attitude towards a certain degree of development of capitalism, especially emphasizing the use of "competition" to resolve this fundamental contradiction. They adopt a cautious attitude towards the relationship between new democratic society and socialism, emphasizing the long-term nature of the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society.
Ⅳ. The crystallization of the theory of new democratic state-building - "Common Program"
On October 1, 1949, the long-awaited independent and unified new democratic new China finally came into being. The "Common Program" adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference serves as the program and blueprint for the construction of new China, stipulating the essence of the theory of new democratic revolution and new democratic society in the form of a temporary constitution. Because of this, a distinct characteristic of the "Common Program" is that it explicitly states what should and can be done during the current stage, while temporarily keeping silent on what should be done in the future but cannot be done at the present stage, and it does not provide a specific depiction of the distant future of society. This is a truly action plan rooted in the reality of China and meeting the needs of the people. Based on this, Liu Shaoqi, representing the CPC, solemnly announced at a plenary session of the Political Consultative Conference that the Chinese Communist Party fully complies with all the provisions of the "Common Program" and calls on the whole nation to strive for the thorough realization of this program.
1. Regarding the national system and political system
Regarding the national system and political system, the "Common Program" stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which unites all democratic classes and nationalities in China." "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at various levels and the people's governments at various levels. The highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress. Democratic centralism is practiced in all levels of state power organs."
The provisions of the "Common Program" have been developed and finally formed through long-term practice and exploration. Mao Zedong pointed out before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War: "There will be several stages of development in the democratic revolution, all under a democratic republic. It is a long process of struggle from the dominance of the bourgeoisie to the dominance of the proletariat." In early 1940, in the "On New Democracy," the Party clearly put forward the slogan of the "New Democratic Republic," which preliminarily defined the national system of the New Democratic Republic as the "united dictatorship of the revolutionary classes." In 1944, the Communist Party of China put forward the slogan of abolishing the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang and establishing a democratic united government. The Seventh National Congress of the Party explicitly stated: "After thoroughly defeating the Japanese aggressors, we will establish a national system of a democratic united front led by the working class and based on the vast majority of the people in the country." On April 30, 1948, the "May Day Slogan" issued by the CPC Central Committee excluded the reactionary ruling group of the Kuomintang from the democratic united government based on the change in the balance of power. In 1949, in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," it further clarified: "To summarize our experience, the key point is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) based on the alliance of workers and peasants"; "The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, but mainly the alliance of the working class and the peasant class." Although the national bourgeoisie still holds great importance, their social and economic status determines that they "should not occupy the dominant position in the state power." Regarding the political system of the new China, that is, the organizational form of the political power of the new democratic state, it adopts democratic centralism, with the people's congresses at various levels determining major policies, electing the government, and not following the parliamentary system and the separation of powers of the bourgeois state in terms of legislation, administration, and judiciary.
In the late stage of the Liberation War, when there were significant changes in the political situation and the balance of class forces, there were certain doubts or concerns among some cadres of the Party and some members of democratic parties and non-partisans: should we continue to adhere to the new democratic system, should we return to the proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants that existed during the land revolution war period, or should we directly follow the path of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union? The formulation of the "Common Program" shows that the Party adheres to the theory of people's democratic dictatorship formed and developed during the democratic revolution and puts it into practice in the founding of the country, establishing a new type of state power. People's democratic dictatorship excludes the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, so it is different from a united government; however, it includes the participation of representatives of the national bourgeoisie and their political parties in the government, making the united class scope wider than the proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants. This is an important characteristic that sets it apart from the proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants. However, people's democratic dictatorship is led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and has socialism as its goal. In essence, it is the same as the proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants. Liu Shaoqi made insightful explanations on this point in a written report submitted to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during his visit to the Soviet Union in July 1949. He said, "China's people's democratic dictatorship has similarities with Lenin's proposed 'proletarian dictatorship of the workers and peasants' during the 1905-1907 revolution, but also has differences," because it also includes representatives and factions of the bourgeoisie. "The form of people's democratic dictatorship is the system of people's congresses. This is not a bourgeois parliamentary system, but rather similar to the Soviet system, although it differs from the Soviet system of proletarian dictatorship because representatives of the democratic bourgeoisie participate in the people's congresses." In August of the same year, he said at a meeting of the Northeast Bureau cadres, "Because we need to cooperate with the bourgeoisie for a considerable period of time, China cannot establish a proletarian dictatorship but only a people's democratic dictatorship. We should not think that just because Eastern Europe has a proletarian dictatorship, we should also have a proletarian dictatorship. Insisting on this would become dogmatism. We need to determine our issues based on the specific conditions in China."
The concept of the national and political system for the new China proposed by the Communist Party of China was discussed and reached a consensus during the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and it was written into the "Common Program". This new form of dictatorship was suitable for the level of economic and political development and practical requirements of China at that time, and it was another great achievement in the sinicization of Marxism.
However, subsequent developments proved that the Party's understanding of concepts such as people's democratic dictatorship, proletarian dictatorship, and dictatorship of the proletariat was not very stable at that time. After certain changes occurred in the situation later on, when the stage of the new democratic society was no longer mentioned, the boundaries between these concepts became blurred or directly equated with each other.
2. On the economic composition and economic system of the new democracy.
The "Common Program" stipulates that the fundamental principle of economic construction in the People's Republic of China is the policy of balancing the interests of the public and private sectors, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and domestic and international exchanges, in order to achieve the goal of developing production and prosperity in the economy. The state should adopt various policies to ensure that various economic components, under the leadership of state-owned economy, divide labor and cooperate, so that each can obtain what they need, and promote the development of the entire social economy. State-owned economy is the leading force of the socialist economy and an important component of the whole people's economy. The cooperative economy is a semi-socialist economy and should be encouraged and supported to develop cooperative undertakings based on voluntary principles. Private economy projects that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood should be encouraged for their operational enthusiasm and supported for their development; under necessary and possible conditions, private capital should be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism.
These economic principles have been discussed many times in the works of Mao Zedong and other party leaders. For example, at the Central Political Bureau Meeting in September 1948, Mao Zedong focused on the socialist elements in the economic composition of New China and pointed out, "In our social economy, the things that play a decisive role are state-owned economy and public-owned economy. This country is led by the proletariat, so these economies are of a socialist nature. Although rural individual economy and urban private economy are large in quantity, they do not play a decisive role. Our state-owned economy and public-owned economy, although small in quantity, play a decisive role." "This statement about the socialist nature should be made, but the whole national economy is still a new democratic economy, that is, an economic system under the leadership of the socialist economy."
At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Mao Zedong further elaborated, "State-owned economy is of socialist nature, cooperative economy is of semi-socialist nature, along with private capitalism, individual economy, and state capitalism formed through cooperation between the state and private sectors, these are the main economic components of the People's Republic of China, which constitute the economic form of the new democratic state." In the entire national economy, state-owned economy is the leading component and plays a decisive role. Because "private capitalist industry in China ranks second in modern industry and is an undeniable force," therefore, "after the revolutionary victory, for quite a long period of time, it is still necessary to make full use of the enthusiasm of urban and rural private capitalism to promote the development of the national economy." At the same time, it is necessary to implement "appropriate and flexible restrictive policies" towards capitalism from several aspects. He emphasized that the Chinese economy is still underdeveloped, and the proportion of modern industries in the entire national economy is still very small. This is the fundamental basis for the Party to formulate economic policies, and "this is also the basic starting point for all issues during the period of the Chinese revolution and for quite a long period after the revolutionary victory."
The "Common Program" and the party's basic economic principles of the new democratic society, based on which the socialist nature of state-owned economy has continuously developed and strengthened since the establishment of New China, fully utilize the productive forces of capitalist industry, gradually increase the proportion of modern industry in the entire national economy, rapidly restore and develop productive forces, and lay the material and technological foundation for the transformation towards socialism, which has great significance.
3. The multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party of China
The People's Republic of China implements a multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party of China, rather than a one-party system. The "Common Program" stipulates that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, composed of representatives from the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, the People's Liberation Army, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic individuals, is the organizational form of the people's democratic united front. It also points out that before the convening of the National People's Congress through general elections, the plenary session of the political consultative conference exercises the powers of the National People's Congress and "exercises the powers of state power".
During the long-term revolutionary struggles against imperialism and feudalism, the Communist Party of China established close cooperative relations with various democratic parties. Upholding the united front of the people's democratic forces is a major weapon for the Communist Party to successfully lead the New Democratic Revolution. After the nationwide victory of the New Democratic Revolution, some people within the Communist Party believed that the revolution was successful and that the united front and democratic parties were "optional". Similarly, some people within the democratic parties thought that their mission was completed and they wanted to end gloriously and "disappear without a trace". In response to these understandings, before and after the political consultative conference, Mao Zedong instructed the party to recognize the long-term legitimate existence of various democratic parties and to create a "multiparty coexistence" political situation. Zhou Enlai also pointed out at the Political Consultative Conference on September 22, 1949, that in order to build a new China, "we must unite the various democratic classes, ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese to form such a great people's democratic united front." "This kind of united front should continue and develop organizationally to promote its development." "Since there are various classes in the era of New Democracy, there will be various political parties."
The multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party established in the "Common Program" is the inheritance and development of Marxist party theory and state theory. Marx and Engels once envisioned that in the struggle for the proletariat to seize power, there should be unity and cooperation with other working-class parties and parties striving for democracy, but they did not have the vision of party relations after the establishment of proletarian dictatorship due to lack of practice. Lenin, in leading the Russian Revolution, emphasized the leadership of the Bolshevik Party while also considering inviting minority factions such as the Mensheviks to participate in the new government, thereby establishing a coalition government within the Soviet scope. However, due to the flip-flopping and non-cooperative attitude of the other party, the envisioned multi-party cooperation was not realized. The founding practice of the Communist Party of China, based on the united front of multi-party cooperation during the democratic revolution period, has developed into a multi-party cooperation governing system. This is the result of combining Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions and a vivid embodiment of the sinicization of Marxism.
The system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China, unlike the governing system of multi-party rule in Western countries, is a one-party leadership of multi-party cooperation based on the "Common Program". This political system, which is suitable for China's national conditions, has demonstrated unique political advantages and strong vitality in China's subsequent political and social life, playing an irreplaceable and significant role.
4. A unified People's Republic of multiple ethnic groups
Another major contribution of the "Common Program" to the basic system of the country is the determination that China is a unified People's Republic of multiple ethnic groups, rather than a federal system of multiple ethnic republics.
Due to the influence of the wave of national self-determination after World War I and the Soviet Union, in the Communist Party of China's previous program documents, there were also advocacies for national self-determination and the establishment of a "federation". In the manifesto of the Second National Congress of the Party in 1922, the establishment of the "Chinese Federal Republic" was proposed. In the Party Constitution of the Seventh National Congress in 1945, the proposal for the establishment of a "new democratic federal republic based on the voluntary association of all nationalities" was put forward. The "Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" on October 10, 1947 also proposed "equal autonomy and free joining of the Chinese Federation" for various ethnic minorities within China. This understanding persisted until before the convening of the Political Consultative Conference in 1949.
On the eve of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, there was a major shift in the Party's understanding during the drafting of the "Common Program". Mao Zedong proposed that we must consider whether to adopt a federal system or a unified republic, as well as minority regional autonomy. On September 7, 1949, when Zhou Enlai made a report to the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), he raised the question: "Regarding the national system, whether our country is a multinational federation... please consider." He said, "China is a multinational country, but the Han ethnic group constitutes the majority of the population, while all minority ethnic groups combined make up less than ten percent of the national population. Regardless of the number, all ethnic groups are equal." "The main issue here is whether our ethnic policy aims for autonomy or goes beyond the scope of autonomy. We advocate ethnic autonomy, but we must prevent imperialism from using ethnic issues to sow discord and disrupt China's unity." We should adopt a policy that unites all ethnic groups into one big family and prevents imperialist attempts to sow division. Today, imperialist powers are trying to splinter our Tibet, Taiwan, and even Xinjiang. In this situation, we hope that all ethnic groups will not listen to the instigations of imperialists. To achieve this, our country is named the People's Republic of China, not a federation. Based on this new understanding, the PCC conference, taking into account China's characteristics of having numerous minority ethnic groups with small populations and dispersed settlements, decided that the new China would not adopt a federal system with multiple ethnic groups, but would establish a unified republic and implement ethnic regional autonomy. The new country was named the People's Republic of China, not a federation.
The establishment of the system of ethnic regional autonomy within a unitary state, as defined in the "Common Program", is another important characteristic that distinguishes New China from the Soviet model in terms of nation-building. It is a new achievement of the Chinese Communists' independent exploration of the path to nation-building, and a great creation in terms of applying Marxist-Leninist national theory to solve China's national and state system problems. The establishment of the system of ethnic regional autonomy plays an important role in maintaining the unity of all ethnic groups and the unity of the country, as well as in establishing new equal, united, and mutually supportive relations among the ethnic groups. The development of New China over the past half century has shown that this institutional design has profound significance for achieving long-term stability and harmony in the country in a complex international environment.
When formulating the "Common Program", due to the fact that the revolutionary forces represented by the Communist Party were in a position of political and economic advantage, and the socialist factors had greatly increased, the future transformation towards socialism became even more clear. Therefore, during the discussion of the general outline of the "Common Program", some held the opinion that since the transition from new democracy to socialism and communism was inevitable, "the future path should be clearly defined in the general outline". In response to this understanding, on September 22, 1949, Zhou Enlai, appointed by the central leadership, explained in his report at the plenary session of the PCC that the transition towards socialism was indeed certain and beyond doubt, but it should be demonstrated to the whole nation through explanation, propaganda, and especially practice. "Only when the people of the whole country recognize, through their own practice, that this is the only and best path, will they truly acknowledge it and be willing to devote themselves wholeheartedly to it. Therefore, we should not write it out for the time being, not to deny it, but to treat it more seriously. Moreover, within the economic part of this program, it has already been stipulated to practically ensure progress towards this path."
The "Common Program" summarizes the basic experience of the Chinese new democratic revolution in the form of a fundamental guiding principle, and outlines the strategies and directions for the construction of New China. It represents the advanced stage of development of new democratic theory and serves as the basic guideline for the transition to a new stage. It encompasses the Communist Party of China's entire minimum program, which is to achieve the tasks of the new democratic revolution and construction at the current stage, while also connecting to the Party's future socialist program in terms of the basic principles for governance for a considerable period of time.
The formulation and implementation of the "Common Program" is an exemplary practice of the Party following Marxism and based on the practical situation in China. It is a masterpiece of the Party's continuous advancement of Marxism's sinicization during the leadership of the New Democratic Revolution. It reflects the Party's profound grasp of the essence of Marxism on the eve of its nationwide governance, laying down fundamental prerequisites and institutional foundations for the development and progress of contemporary China.

Chapter 3 The Unfolding of the Idea of Establishing New China through the Implementation of the "Common Program"
On October 1, 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China opened a new chapter in Chinese history and the history of the Communist Party of China, as well as a new chapter in the sinicization of Marxism.
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the party led the people in implementing the program of building a new democratic country comprehensively. While fully restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production and various economic undertakings, on one hand, we established and developed a state-owned economy and made it take a leading position in the national economy. On the other hand, we carried out various reforms centered around land reform, vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, eliminated the remnants of the armed forces of the reactionary Kuomintang, and cleansed the stains of the old society. China entered a historical period of unprecedented stability, and profound changes took place in social life.
The new democratic society is a transitional society, an intermediate stage in the transition from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society to a socialist society. These fundamental understandings were established by the Communist Party during the period of democratic revolution. Its classic exposition was pointed out by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: to transform China from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist society. In the context of Party's governance and the establishment of the leading position of the state-owned economy in the national economy during the comprehensive implementation of the new democratic program, the new democratic theory also faced the task of development and enrichment. The question is only how to develop and in which direction.
I. Comprehensively implement the policy of building a new democratic country and restore and develop the national economy
At the beginning of the establishment of the new China, the primary task facing the entire party was to restore the economy and complete the unfinished tasks of the democratic revolution. It should be noted that the completion of these basic tasks was done under the new democratic economic and political system, which in turn promoted the consolidation and development of this system. This means that the period of economic recovery is also the period of building a new democratic society.
1. "We cannot implement socialism quickly."
The main focus of the New Democratic economic construction is the development of five economic elements. Following the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, in the party's urban work, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class and prioritize the restoration and development of state-owned industries, making them the leading force and occupying the main position in the national economy. At the same time, we allow for the development of private capitalism and individual economy, harnessing their positive roles in developing productivity. Although the Party's leaders, relevant policies, and the "Common Program" have provided principles and regulations, due to the inherent contradictions in the New Democratic theory, especially the contradiction between the "fundamental contradiction" and the central task, as well as the emergence of various new situations and problems in practical work, some cadres still remain confused and wavering.
How to perceive and treat the urban bourgeoisie in industrial and commercial sectors: should we copy the Soviet experience, rush to launch an attack on capitalism, or should we start from China's national conditions, adhere to the theory of New Democratic socialism, affirming that in a China where the means of production are extremely backward, capitalism's existence and development is necessary, and the transition to socialism is only possible after a considerable level of development of productivity is achieved? In the face of confusion within and outside the Party, the Party Central Committee attaches great importance to guiding the understanding and treatment of the position and role of the urban bourgeoisie in the New Democratic construction among the vast number of party members and cadres.
At that time, it was essential to strictly distinguish between the limits of feudal exploitation and capitalist exploitation, and to affirm the important position and role of capitalism and the bourgeoisie in the country's life, in order to correct the "left" mistakes in urban work. In April 1949, Liu Shaoqi's "Tianjin Speech" played an important role in this regard. It is worth noting that at the beginning of the founding of New China, although some cadres had some simplistic understanding of the national bourgeoisie, the Party Central Committee's understanding was clear and firm. At the National United Front Conference held in April 1950, a senior cadre stated in his speech, "Today's main struggle is against the bourgeoisie." This erroneous statement caught the attention of Zhou Enlai. On the 12th, Zhou Enlai sent a record of this speech to Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by a letter pointing out that "this is a mistaken and confusing opinion", and he was not the only one with such confused ideas. On April 13th, Zhou Enlai pointed out at the National United Front Conference, "Today our central issue is not to overthrow the bourgeoisie, but how to cooperate with them." Our "state-owned economic strength is still small, and private economy, which is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, has a certain positive role, and should be supported and developed" to "help meet the various needs of the people with the state-owned economy." It is impossible to "force socialism to emerge" through coercive means. "The issue of encouraging the development of private enterprises is already on our agenda." If the interests of the public and the private cannot be balanced, it will be difficult to achieve mutual benefits for labor and capital. In response to the problems raised by Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong instructed, "Today's main struggle is against imperialism and its running dogs, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary faction, not the national bourgeoisie." Concerning the national bourgeoisie, "we adopt a policy of uniting and struggling to achieve the goal of uniting it for the common development of the national economy." Regarding the statement in the draft speech that "state-owned economy should be developed without restriction", Mao Zedong criticized, "This is a long-term matter and cannot be developed without restriction at this stage. We must simultaneously utilize private capital."
In March and April 1950, the central government successively held working conferences and Politburo meetings, attended by leaders from various regions, in preparation for the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Party Congress. The meetings clearly pointed out that the principle of adjusting industry and commerce is to balance the interests of both public and private sectors and labor and capital, and to correct the incorrect ideas and practices of some cadres who want to crush private industry and commerce. Mao Zedong said at the meeting, "Cooperating with the bourgeoisie is certain. Otherwise, the 'Common Program' would be a worthless piece of paper, politically harmful, and economically disadvantageous. It is not about looking at the monks' faces but at the Buddha's face. Maintaining private industry and commerce is, first, maintaining production, second, maintaining workers, and third, workers can also enjoy some benefits. Of course, there should also be a certain profit for the bourgeoisie. But comparatively speaking, developing private industry and commerce at present is more beneficial to the workers and the people than to the capitalists themselves." He also said, "We are a large party, and we must pay special attention to strategy. Especially now that we have won, we must consolidate our victory and pay even more attention to opposing 'left' ideas and practices."
On May 25th, Mao Zedong proposed at a Central Politburo meeting: there should be "differences and equality" towards private industry and commerce. He explained that the so-called "differences" mean that state-owned economy occupies the leading position, which is progressive, and reversing the positions is not feasible. But in other matters, equal treatment and overall consideration should be given. "Today's capitalist industry and commerce are needed and beneficial to society. It is reasonable for private industry and commerce to be under the government's wing because it meets the needs of the people and improves the lives of workers." "Private industry and commerce will exist for a long time, and we cannot implement socialism quickly."
2. "Do not attack on all sides"
In order to focus on the recovery and development of production and the comprehensive development of new democratic construction, the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party was held in Beijing in June 1950. The central topic of the meeting was to determine the main tasks of the Party during the period of national economic recovery, as well as the various work that must be carried out and the strategic policies to be adopted. It was the most important meeting of the Central Committee of the Party in the early days of the founding of New China.
In response to some biases in dealing with the national industrial and commercial sector at that time, in order to ensure that the work of the Party and the government proceeded cautiously and steadily, the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee explicitly opposed the "leftist" tendency within the Party that some people believed in "early elimination of capitalism and implementation of socialism". Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the meeting, "Some people believe that it is possible to eliminate capitalism early and implement socialism. This kind of thinking is wrong and not suitable for our country's situation." "The national bourgeoisie will be eliminated in the future, but for now, we should unite them around us and not push them away. On the one hand, we should struggle against them, and on the other hand, we should unite with them. We must explain this principle to the cadres and prove it with facts. It is right and necessary to unite with the national bourgeoisie, democratic parties, democratic individuals, and intellectuals." The Party's policy towards the national bourgeoisie is still one of unity and struggle, with unity as the main focus; it is about regulating capital rather than squeezing it out.
At the meeting, Mao Zedong put forward the famous strategic thinking of "not attacking on all sides." He said: Our current overall policy is to eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang, spies, and bandits, overthrow the landlord class, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and fight imperialism to the end. In the upcoming land reform that will overthrow the entire landlord class, our enemies are numerous and formidable. Faced with such complex struggles, we currently have a strained relationship with the national bourgeoisie, and there are some dissatisfied people among the workers, peasants, small-scale artisans, and intellectuals. In order to isolate and strike our current enemies, we must turn those who are dissatisfied with us among the people into supporters. Faced with complex struggles and many difficulties, we must not make too many enemies. We must make concessions and ease tensions in one aspect and concentrate our efforts on another aspect. "In short, we should not attack on all sides." "This is our policy, this is our strategic orientation, and this is the line of the Third Plenary Session."
On June 23rd, in the closing speech of the second session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mao Zedong further stated: Implementing socialist transformation nationwide, that is, implementing the nationalization of private industry and the socialization of agriculture, is still a long way off. "Our country is steadily moving forward through war, through the reform of new democracy, and in the future, after the national economy and cultural undertakings flourish, we can calmly and properly enter a new era of socialism."
At the plenum, Chen Yun made a report on the financial and economic issues and made specific arrangements for the rational adjustment of industry and commerce. He pointed out that the five types of economic components should be coordinated and balanced, which is beneficial to the people. Only by coordinating and balancing, and everyone benefiting from it, can we promote new democracy and move towards socialism in the future. However, the status of the five economic components is different, and it is all under the leadership of state-owned economy. In terms of adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors, private factories' production and sales should be organized in a step-by-step manner through processing orders. By appropriately adjusting prices and the division of labor in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, private businesses can be profitable.
The 3rd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee was the first central session held by the Communist Party of China after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The strategic guideline proposed, "Don't Attack on All Sides," was based on the party's theory of new democratic society and the Common Program. It was formulated through a scientific analysis of the situation at the time and the class relations within the domestic and united front. It promptly and explicitly criticized the "left" tendency within the party that advocated for the early elimination of capitalism and the implementation of socialism. It played a significant role in unifying the party's thinking, uniting all possible social forces, striving for a fundamental improvement in the country's economic situation, and cautiously yet actively carrying out the comprehensive construction of new democracy.
II. In the early days of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the party introduced innovative policies in the rural areas
1. In the land reform in the newly liberated areas, the party preserved the economy of the rich peasants and allowed it to develop to a certain extent.
Thoroughly abolishing feudal and semi-feudal land ownership is an important part of the new democratic revolution and a fundamental condition for the restoration and development of the national economy. When New China was established, land reform had not yet been carried out in the newly liberated areas, where two-thirds of the country still had a feudal land system that severely constrained the development of productivity. Thoroughly abolishing this land system was a basic task at the beginning of New China. However, unlike in the old revolutionary base areas where excess land from the rich peasants was requisitioned, in the land reform in the newly liberated areas, the central Party formulated and implemented a series of new policies based on the comprehensive implementation of the program for a new democratic republic. Among them, the most important one was the preservation of the rich peasant economy. The number of rich peasant households during the land reform in the newly liberated areas accounted for about 3% of the total rural households, and they did not hold an important position in the Chinese economy. But what policy to adopt towards the rich peasants directly affected other classes of peasants, especially the middle peasants, and also had certain implications for the national bourgeoisie, who were closely linked to land ownership. Therefore, Mao Zedong proposed a cautious approach towards the rich peasants during the discussion on land reform policies in the newly liberated areas at the November 1949 meeting of the Central Political Bureau. In March 1950, he sent telegrams to various central bureaus to solicit opinions on the policy towards rich peasants, proposing that in the land reform movement in the newly liberated areas, "not only should we not touch capitalist rich peasants, but we should also not touch semi-feudal rich peasants, and the problem of semi-feudal rich peasants should be resolved after a few years". He pointed out that there were three reasons for doing so: First, the scale of the land reform was unprecedentedly enormous, making it prone to "leftist" deviations. If we only target the landlords without touching the rich peasants, we can isolate the landlords more effectively and protect the middle peasants. Second, the land reform in the past in the northern part of the country was carried out during the war, and the atmosphere of war overshadowed the atmosphere of land reform. Now, there is basically no war, and the land reform is particularly prominent, causing significant shocks to society. Third, we have already formed a united front with the national bourgeoisie in terms of politics, economics, and organization. The national bourgeoisie is closely related to the land issue. In order to stabilize the national bourgeoisie, it is appropriate not to touch the semi-feudal rich peasants temporarily. 
During the discussion of the draft land reform law at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, based on opinions put forward by some localities, supplementary modifications were made to the relevant articles, changing the original provision of "not touching the land and property of the rich peasants" to "protecting the land and property that the rich peasants themselves cultivate or employ others to cultivate, and not infringing upon it," "but in certain special areas, with the approval of the people's governments at or above the provincial level, a part or all of their rented land may be requisitioned." This policy of the central Party is not only conducive to politically neutralizing the rich peasants and further isolating the landlord class, reducing resistance to land reform, but also conducive to encouraging the enthusiasm of the middle peasants to develop production, stabilizing the sentiment of the national bourgeoisie, and preventing "leftist" deviations in the land reform.
In June 1950, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Liu Shaoqi delivered a report on the land reform issue on behalf of the Central Committee. In the report, he further expounded his views on some basic issues in rural areas. He stated that the fundamental purpose of land reform is to focus on production, "not solely to relieve poor farmers, but to liberate rural productivity from the shackles of the landlord class and feudal land ownership, in order to develop agricultural production and pave the way for industrialization in New China. Only when agricultural production can greatly develop, industrialization in New China can be realized, the living standards of the entire population can improve, and ultimately, the problem of rural poverty can be resolved. Implementing land reform alone can only partially solve the problem of rural poverty, but it cannot solve all of the farmer's problems. "The fundamental reasons and purposes of land reform are focused on production," "each step of land reform must effectively take into account and closely integrate with the development of rural production. It is precisely because of this fundamental reason and purpose that the CPC Central Committee proposed to preserve the wealthy peasant economy in future land reforms. Because the existence and to some extent, development of the wealthy peasant economy is beneficial to the development of the national economy and is therefore beneficial to the broad masses of farmers," "both politically and economically, it is necessary." Based on their understanding of the current nature and tasks of the revolution, he further explained, "The policy of preserving the wealthy peasant economy that we have adopted is certainly not a temporary policy, but a long-term policy. That is to say, the wealthy peasant economy must be preserved throughout the entire stage of the New Democratic Revolution. Only when the conditions are ripe, to the extent that large-scale mechanized farming can be widely adopted in rural areas, collective farming can be organized, and socialist transformation can be carried out in rural areas, will the existence of the wealthy peasant economy become unnecessary, and this can only be achieved in the fairly distant future."
Starting from the winter of 1950, an unprecedentedly large-scale land reform movement was carried out in the newly liberated areas involving nearly 300 million agricultural population, with leadership, in a step-by-step and phased manner. Under the guidance of the new land reform law, not only did the vast majority of poor and middle peasants receive land and other means of production, resulting in a fundamental change in the land ownership relationship in the rural areas of our country, but the wealthy peasant economy was also preserved, and the land and other property of middle peasants, including wealthy middle peasants, were protected. With the gradual completion of land reform in the new areas, the production enthusiasm of the peasants surged, agricultural production developed rapidly, and the income of peasants increased universally, providing a strong impetus for the recovery and development of the national economy.
The decision of the central authorities on the land reform in the new areas and the explanations of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and others on the party's policy towards the wealthy peasants are no longer simply based on the perspective of class struggle, but more focused on the extremely backward state of rural productivity, the rapid development of rural productivity, that is, based on the national conditions, independently exploring the path of Chinese construction and formulating an important policy that is conducive to the development of productivity. "Some basic points on the land problem and the peasant problem have been talked about by Marx and Lenin, but in dealing with China's land and peasant problems, we still need to create, and we need to propose specific solutions based on China's actual conditions. For example, the issue of wealthy peasants, in the past, surplus land and property of wealthy peasants were requisitioned and distributed to poor hired peasants. "Today, with the victory of the war, in order to restore and develop production, we must protect the wealthy peasant economy." "This is the concrete analysis of the specific situation, which is the essence of Marxism." This significant policy in the land reform of the new areas is a brilliant interpretation by the Chinese Communists at the beginning of their rule regarding standards of productivity.
2. Discussion on the issue of rich peasant party members in Northeast China
After the establishment of the New China, in the Northeast and North China, which had completed the land reform earlier, the production and living conditions of farmers have generally improved significantly. Based on the recovery and development of agricultural production, many former poor peasants and hired workers, with better production conditions and labor skills, have gradually increased their economic income and begun to possess production and living conditions equivalent to those of middle peasants before the land reform. Individual farmers have also set their goals for prosperity, such as "three horses and one plow-cart" and "thirty mu of land with one cow," and middle peasants have gradually become the majority and "central figures" in rural society. Within the party members, there has also been a phenomenon of some members engaging in hired labor independently.
How to view the trend of middle peasantization in rural areas and the emerging new rich peasants is a completely new issue for the entire party. There is no ready-made answer in the classic works of Marxism, nor can we find methods that can be borrowed from the Soviet experience. At that time, there were different understandings within the party. The majority of people, starting from the discourse of classic authors and the fundamental principles of the party, believed that Communist Party members should not engage in exploitation. They should follow the path of mutual assistance, cooperation, and common prosperity, and restrictions should be imposed on the newly emerging rich peasants. Some people also believed that since the state policy allows for the existence of rich peasants, party members in the new group of rich peasants should also be allowed. The policies within and outside the party should be consistent; otherwise, it would affect the enthusiasm of farmers in developing production.
On January 22, 1950, the Central Organization Department expressed its own views on the issues of party member employees and party members not participating in labor transformation in the opinions drafted for the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau: whether party member employees exist or not, whether they participate in labor transformation or not, should have complete freedom, and the party should not impose coercion on them, nor should their party membership be suspended or expelled as a result; if there is excessive emphasis on party members not being allowed to exploit others and they must participate in labor transformation organizations and take a leading role, it will inevitably make some party members passive in production. The experiences from various regions have proved that if party members do not have employment, the masses will not dare to hire employees. If party members are passive in production, the enthusiasm for production among the masses will never be mobilized. Therefore, in educating party members who are farmers, the benefits of organization must be pointed out, but at the same time, it must be made clear that "working individually" and "being employed" are also allowed by the party's policies. At the same time, cadres at all levels should be informed that on the basis of the individual economy in rural areas today, a certain degree of development of rural capitalism is inevitable. It is not terrible for some party members to develop towards wealthy farmers, and it is premature and therefore incorrect to raise the issue of what to do if party members become wealthy farmers.
On January 23, Liu Shaoqi issued a reply letter from the Central Organization Department to the Northeast Bureau, and had a conversation with An Ziwen, an official from the Central Organization Department, that evening. He said: After the land reform in the northeast, the rural economy has started to develop. Farmers who have three horses, a plow, and a cart are not wealthy farmers but middle peasants. This relatively prosperous group of farmers who have three horses, a plow, and a cart may and should account for 80% in a few years. "Now in the northeast, these middle peasants should have abundant development." He believed that today's labor and assistance organizations in the northeast are based on bankrupt and impoverished individual economic foundations, which are not good foundations. "In the future, as the development progresses, the individual economy will be able to produce independently, and the need for labor assistance will inevitably shrink." If farmers have three horses, they can still participate in labor and assist each other, or work individually. "Now 70% of the households participate in labor and assistance, but this number will shrink in the future. This is a good phenomenon, which proves that the economy has developed and there are more middle peasants among farmers. They can work individually, and this is also a natural phenomenon. With 70% of households having three horses, it will be easier to establish collective farms in the future. Therefore, now we must promote and explain the benefits of labor transformation organizations, but we must also allow individual work." Regarding the suggestion of some people to quickly develop labor and assistance organizations into collective farms, Liu Shaoqi believed it was "impossible". He said, "These are two different stages, and we must prevent acute diseases." "From individual production to collective farms, it is a revolution in production methods, and collective farms without machinery and tools cannot be consolidated." Liu Shaoqi's view on the existence of exploitation in the new democratic countries is: "Exploitation is still necessary now, and we should welcome exploitation. Workers demand capitalists to exploit, and they cannot survive without exploitation. There are a large number of refugees going to the northeast this year, and if rich farmers from outside the customs can exploit them, they will be grateful." "Rich farmers employ more people, buy horses, and we should not restrict them. We should let them develop now, there is no harm in that." "Let them develop to a certain extent, and then impose restrictions in the future." "It is too early to restrict individual work now. It is good that they can work individually now. Also, we cannot consider farmers who oppose individual work as advocates of collectivism, because they are still impoverished peasants who are unable to work individually." "Employment and individual work should be left to flow freely. It would be great if all farmers have three horses, a plow, and can work individually. Those who do not allow employment and individual work should not be left unchecked, and those who interfere with those who have three horses should not be left unchecked." 
Regarding the issue of Party members who have already emerged and developed into rich peasants, Liu Shaoqi demonstrated his broad vision and deep understanding of the essence of the New Democratic Theory. He said, "This question is raised too early. Even with exploitation, one can still be a socialist. Saint-Simon was a capitalist, but he was also a socialist, although it was utopian at the time. If a capitalist in the northeast were to follow Saint-Simon's approach today, he could succeed and not fail." "Even if there are ten thousand rich peasant Party members in the northeast in the future, it is not terrible." "Therefore, current peasant Party members can engage in individual farming. Our party regulations allow Party members to engage in individual farming and to hire employees. Believing that Party members cannot engage in exploitation is a kind of doctrinaire thinking." "But being able to engage in individual farming and should engage in individual farming are two different things. We allow Party members to engage in individual farming, but it does not mean that we encourage them to do so."
The victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the completion of land reform liberated rural productive forces and relatively quickly improved the production and living conditions of the majority of peasants. The phenomenon of the middle peasants and hired laborers appearing in the countryside is inevitable and difficult to avoid. This is because "we are currently in a society with private ownership." The question is how to understand these phenomena. Should we follow the general discussions of Marxism in classical works or the Stalin model, or should we start from China's national conditions and reality? Should we start from abstract ideological and moral standards, or should we start from the standards of productive forces? Liu Shaoqi started from the extremely backward level of productivity in our rural areas, from the urgent requirement for development of production, and from the program of the New Democratic State. He opposed the abstract denial of all exploitation, just as he affirmed the exploitation of the national bourgeoisie within certain limits and for a certain period of time in the cities. Affirming individual farming, the tendency toward the middle peasants and a certain degree of exploitation by rich peasants in the countryside does not deny the collectivization of the countryside, but rather connects it with a certain degree of development of productive forces. "Transitioning from individual production to collective agricultural communes is a revolutionary change in the mode of production. Collective agricultural communes without machinery and tools cannot be consolidated." This viewpoint particularly emphasizes the fundamental principle of Marxism - the determinism of productive forces, without specifically highlighting the counter-effects of superstructure and ideology. Under certain conditions, revolution can succeed in countries with backward productive forces, but in order to implement the program of the New Democratic State and prepare for the transition to socialism, corresponding material foundations and conditions of productive forces must be present. "Poverty" can trigger a revolution, but it cannot become the foundation of socialism. The correct policies of the Party towards rich peasants and other issues played a significant role in preventing "acute diseases" in various aspects of social transformation at that time.
III. Consolidation or Transition: A Major Issue Involved in a Debate
Since the proposal of the theory of New Democracy, the whole Party has had a clear and firm understanding of the transition from New Democracy to socialism. However, the length of this transition period is considered to be quite long, mainly due to the backwardness of China's productive forces. This judgment is correct, but it is also relatively abstract and general. Before the establishment of the new China, the length of the transition period was not an urgent issue. However, after the establishment of the new China and the start of comprehensive construction of New Democracy, this issue became prominent. Here, there are not only numerous practical issues that arise in practice, but also some significant theoretical issues that need further clarification or development. Faced with various significant issues raised by theory and practice, there is a lack of consensus within the Party, which is also normal. At that time, questions such as how long the New Democracy stage would last, when it would start transitioning to socialism, what kind of capitalist development would be allowed in a New Democracy country, and when the elimination of bourgeois exploitation could begin were previously impossible to address, but now they are in front of the Party as New Democracy unfolds comprehensively. If the issues discussed in the "Tianjin Speech" and the "Rich Peasant Party Members" primarily involve exploitation phenomena in New Democracy society, then closely following these issues and closely related to them is how to view the question of starting the transition to socialism.
1. The issue raised by the development of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi
In the spring of 1951, there was a debate within the Party regarding the development of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province. At that time, with the successive completion of land reform, there was a general trend of recovery and development in the rural economy, and some peasants had reached the level of prosperous middle peasants. A few prosperous middle peasants, relying on their advantages in capital, labor, and agricultural tools, developed into new-rich peasants through activities such as buying land, hiring workers, and lending money at high interest rates. Some individuals who experienced rapid economic growth perceived the mutual aid groups established after land reform as "pulling together poor people," leading to the dissipation and semi-disintegration of some mutual aid groups. At this time, some peasants began to sell their land, and their living standards declined, leading them into poverty. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the development of New Democracy economy. According to the understanding at that time, this was the spontaneous tendency of small-scale agricultural economy and reflected the new polarization in rural areas. Some cadres within the Party were initially very concerned about the spontaneous tendency of peasants and feared that the peasants' enrichment would have an impact on the mutual aid groups. Therefore, they started to propose measures to "overcome" the spontaneous forces of peasants.
On April 17, 1951, in Shanxi Province, where the land reform and mutual aid cooperation had been completed earlier, the provincial committee wrote a report to the central and North China Bureau titled "Taking the Mutual Aid Groups in Old Areas to a Higher Level". The report pointed out, "With the recovery and development of the rural economy, the spontaneous power of the farmers has developed. However, it is not directed towards the modernization and collectivization we require, but towards the direction of becoming rich peasants. This is the fundamental reason for the disintegration of the mutual aid groups." The conclusion of the report was that the development of the mutual aid groups in the old areas had reached a turning point, and they must be improved; otherwise, they would regress. Therefore, the report proposed that new factors should be strengthened within the mutual aid groups, namely, the establishment and increase of "public accumulation" and "distribution according to work" in order to gradually overcome the spontaneous tendency of the farmers, completely reverse the trend of disintegration, and guide the mutual aid groups towards a higher level. The report stated: "Regarding private ownership as the foundation, the aim should not be to consolidate it, but to gradually shake and weaken it until it is negated."
The North China Bureau expressed different opinions on the report from the Shanxi Provincial Committee. Liu Shaoqi also expressed in April that the conditions were not mature for taking steps to undermine private ownership. Without tractors and fertilizers, there should be no rush to establish agricultural production cooperatives. On May 4, based on Liu Shaoqi's instructions and the opinions of several other provinces in North China, the North China Bureau reviewed and reported on the Shanxi Provincial Committee's report to the central government. The reply pointed out, "Gradually shaking and weakening the foundation of private ownership by using the method of accumulating public funds and distributing according to work is not consistent with the spirit of the party's policy and common program during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, and is therefore incorrect. During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, the revolutionary task can only shake feudal private ownership, imperialist privileges in China, and bureaucratic capitalist private ownership; shaking private property in general is the task of the period of socialist revolution." The current "main problem in improving and consolidating the mutual aid groups is how to enrich their content and production in order to meet the requirements of further developing the farmers, rather than gradually undermining private ownership."
Afterwards, Liu Shaoqi criticized the opinions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee in several speeches. On May 7, 1951, at the First National Propaganda Conference, he said that it is impossible for the Shanxi Provincial Committee to expect to directly transform cooperative societies with socialist characteristics into socialism. "If you believe in this theory, it is socialist fantasy, idealistic socialism, also known as idealistic agricultural socialism, which cannot be achieved." "Within our party in China, there are many agricultural socialist ideas, and this kind of thinking needs to be corrected." "Because relying solely on rural conditions cannot achieve socialism, agricultural socialization must rely on industry." "Only with the nationalization of industry and the nationalization of land can farmers be collectivized." "If we call on farmers to organize cooperatives, and believe that this is socialism, and launch a mass movement, then it will be a grave mistake, which is called idealistic agricultural socialism."
On July 3rd, Liu Shaoqi wrote comments on the report "Taking the organization of mutual aid in the old areas to a higher level" by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and requested that it be sent to the students of the Marxist-Leninist Institute, as well as to the members of the Central Committee and Central Bureau. The comments said, "In the rural areas following the land reform, the spontaneous forces and class differentiation of the peasants have already begun to appear in the process of economic development. Some comrades within the party are afraid of and attempt to prevent or avoid this spontaneous force and class differentiation. They imagine using the methods of labor mutual aid groups and supply and marketing cooperatives to accomplish the goal of preventing or avoiding this trend." "This is a mistaken, dangerous, and utopian socialist agricultural thought. This document from the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee is an example of this thinking."
On the afternoon of July 5th, Liu Shaoqi mentioned the criticism of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee again in his lecture to the students of the Marxist-Leninist Institute. He said that the spontaneous strength of the peasants cannot be stopped. "The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CCP wants to overcome it, prevent it, and avoid it, but this is impossible." "Some people are afraid of this spontaneous force and attempt to stop it, which is the path of error." "Attempting to gradually shake, weaken, and ultimately negate the private property of the peasants within the mutual aid groups and move towards agricultural collectivization is impossible and reformist. The desire to gradually and step by step move towards socialism is a rightist tendency while simultaneously destroying private property is a 'leftist' adventurous inclination."
Liu Shaoqi's opinions reflect a line of thinking within the party on the issue of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, which is to allow a period of development for the individual economy of the peasants according to the ideology of the New Democratic Revolution following land reform, until the agricultural productive forces have reached a certain level of development, especially when industrialization has reached a certain level, and then take practical action to start agricultural cooperation. In other words, the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement should be based on the level of productive forces and meet the actual needs of the peasants. It should not prematurely eliminate the private ownership of the peasants' individual property.
After reading the reports from the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the North China Bureau, as well as Liu Shaoqi's comments, Mao Zedong clearly expressed his support for the opinions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee. He criticized the view that mutual aid groups cannot develop into agricultural production cooperatives and the view that the private foundation cannot be shaken at this stage. His argument was based on the fact that since Western capitalism had a handicraft industry stage in its development process, which was a stage before the adoption of steam power machinery and relied on unified management to form new productive forces, it is also feasible for China's cooperatives to rely on unified management to form new productive forces and shake the private foundation. Mao Zedong's reasoning convinced Liu Shaoqi and others, and they withdrew their own opinions, thus ending the debate.
2. Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Cooperatives
According to Mao Zedong's proposal, the central government convened the first national agricultural mutual aid cooperation conference in September 1951. After the conference, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Cooperation (Draft)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution") was drafted. During the drafting process, Mao Zedong paid attention to listening to different opinions. While affirming the enthusiasm of farmers' mutual aid cooperation, he also affirmed the enthusiasm of farmers' individual economy. He emphasized the need to guard against both right-wing and "left-wing" deviations. The revised "Resolution" was based on Mao Zedong's theoretical viewpoints, as well as incorporating the importance attached by Liu Shaoqi and others to the individual economy of farmers and the need for organizational work to suit the requirements of production development. The "Resolution" points out that the farmers' enthusiasm for production, which has been manifested based on land reform, has two aspects: the enthusiasm for individual economy on the one hand, and the enthusiasm for labor mutual aid on the other hand. Given the economic conditions in rural areas, the individual economy of farmers will be abundant for a considerable period of time, and the enthusiasm for farmers' individual economy is inevitable. It should not be ignored or brutally dampened. At the same time, in order to help farmers overcome the difficulties in individual household operations, avoid polarization, develop production, improve water conservancy, resist natural disasters, adopt agricultural machinery and other new technologies, and increase the country's grain and industrial raw materials, it is necessary to promote "organization" and give play to the enthusiasm of farmers' labor mutual aid. The future development prospect lies in agricultural collectivization. The "Resolution" proposes that, based on the needs and conditions of production development, a positive and steady progress should be made, guiding farmers on the path of mutual aid cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, typical demonstration, and state assistance.
On October 17th, Mao Zedong drafted a communication on forwarding Gao Gang's report on mutual aid cooperation in rural Northeast China, stating that the guidelines proposed in Gao Gang's report were correct. Gao Gang's report believed that as the middle peasants had become the majority in rural areas and the spontaneous development of the farmers, the main tendency to oppose and prevent in guiding mutual aid cooperation work was no longer to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants, but the spontaneous tendency of the farmers. The main concern of the farmers was not "fear of development" or "fear of consolidation", but the demand for rapid expansion of reproduction. On December 15th, Mao Zedong drafted a notice of the Central Committee on the issuance of the "Resolution (Draft) on Mutual Aid Cooperation in Agricultural Production", pointing out that this should be explained and implemented in all areas where land reform had been completed, and the whole party should treat agricultural mutual aid cooperation as a "major matter" to be done. Based on these principles, the nationwide agricultural mutual aid cooperation movement was quickly launched nationwide, which also became one of the bases for the general line of the transitional period put forward in the second half of 1952.
The debate over the development of agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi revolved around the continuation of the debate on the issue of prosperous farmers in Northeast China in 1950, and actually evolved into a debate on agricultural collectivization in 1955. With the development of history, the problems and significance reflected by these debates have increasingly become more profound. It should be said that there is no fundamental difference within the party in guiding individual farmers to organize and embark on the path of collectivization. They all adhere to the program of New Democratic Revolution and the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. The disagreement lies in whether it should be done now or in the future, whether it should be done after the development of productive forces to a certain extent or now, whether the old mutual aid organizations in rural areas should be immediately transformed into agricultural cooperatives with a semi-socialist character, that is, to transition to socialism in rural areas after land reform. Liu Shaoqi and the North China Bureau believed that the private foundation of mutual aid groups should not be shaken at present, and the steps of socialism should be taken after the development of rural productive forces to a certain extent. Mao Zedong and the Shanxi Provincial Committee believed that the old mutual aid groups in the region could be elevated to semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives now.
Due to the limitations of the times and practice, both sides of the debate are inevitably limited by certain historical limitations. However, in terms of the importance of the issues they debated and the theoretical heights they reached, the typical significance cannot be ignored. As for Liu Shaoqi and others, there were simplifications in criticizing the Shanxi Provincial Committee, such as equating "raising agricultural production mutual aid groups to agricultural production collective farms" with shaking, weakening, and even negating the private ownership foundation, and broadly categorizing it as "wrong, dangerous, and utopian agricultural socialism thoughts". They did not specify that although China did not have the conditions to generally establish advanced forms of agricultural production cooperatives at that time, it did not exclude the possibility of seeking specific forms of transition to advanced cooperatives. They excessively emphasized that collectivization should be based on industrialization and modernization, which essentially copied the viewpoint of the Soviet model that only mechanization could achieve collectivization, and so on. However, based on later practice, from a major perspective, Liu Shaoqi and others' opinions were correct. For example, he believed that the polarization in rural areas after land reform was inevitable, including negative aspects, but under the conditions at that time, it was conducive to promoting the development of productive forces. Due to China's backward economy, it was not advisable to take steps to negate private ownership too early or too urgently and it was necessary to continue implementing the policy of New Democracy. Attention should be paid to opposing egalitarianism under the new historical conditions after land reform. Consciously link the transformation of agricultural socialism with national industrialization, etc. These issues adhered to the basic principles of Marxism and made some important innovations based on China's realities. If the party at that time could have had a more comprehensive discussion on these fundamental issues that fundamentally affect socialist transformation and socialist construction, there might have been fewer twists and turns in the future.
IV. Comprehensive Launch of New Democratic Construction
During the period from 1949 to 1952, while carrying out comprehensive reforms and construction of the New Democratic system, the central Party leadership also undertook a series of creative practices and reflections on the political construction of New Democracy.
1. Democratization and industrialization are inseparable
At the beginning of the establishment of the new China, when the conditions for holding a general election of the people's congress were not yet in place, the construction of democratic politics began with the creation and use of various people's congresses, which had a semi-political power nature. At that time, the Party Central Committee attached great importance to the convening of people's congresses from all walks of life. In the first month after the establishment of the Central People's Government, Mao Zedong successively forwarded the experience of holding people's congresses from all walks of life in Shanghai Songjiang County and various cities in North China to various central bureaus and sub-bureaus, and requested that "all of them be handled accordingly." He pointed out that if people's congresses from all walks of life could be held in all the thousand counties and be held well, "it would be extremely important for our party's work of connecting with tens of millions of people and for educating the broad cadres inside and outside the party."
According to the "Common Program," in December 1949, the Central People's Government issued the Regulations on the Organization of People's Congresses from all walks of life at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, stipulating that localities that meet the conditions should urgently convene people's congresses from all walks of life. Through this organizational form, party and government leadership at all levels can hear the voice of the masses, understand their demands, and obtain their assistance in solving difficulties and carrying out work. The Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1950 also emphasized the work of democratic governance, pointing out that we must earnestly hold people's congresses that are sufficient to unite people from all walks of life to work together, and all important work of the people's government should be discussed and decided by the people's congresses.
In the process of guiding and mobilizing the convening of people's congresses, Liu Shaoqi also put forward the idea that democratization and industrialization cannot be separated. In his speech at the third People's Congress of Beijing in February 1952, Liu Shaoqi pointed out that holding people's congresses well should be regarded as an important political construction task closely related to the country's economic construction, especially industrialization. He emphatically stated, "Democratization and industrialization cannot be separated." He said, "Without the democratization of our country and the development of the new democratic political power, the development of the new democratic economy and the industrialization of the country cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, the development of the new democratic economy and the industrialization of the country require significantly strengthening and consolidating the foundation of the new democratic political power. Therefore, our basic slogan is: Democratization and Industrialization!" Recognizing and emphasizing the interrelationship and characteristics between the economic construction and political construction of the new democratic society from this perspective reflects the foresight and ideals of the Communist Party. Although the understanding of this goal at that time was still preliminary and many twists and turns occurred in the process of achieving this goal, the fact that such understanding and raising of the issue occurred at that time has indicated that the governing ideology of the Party's early stage of governance was at the forefront of the times.
2. Adhering to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation
In the process of democratic governance, the Central Committee of the Party has adhered to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation. At the beginning of the establishment of New China, due to some people inside and outside the Party having a vague understanding of the socialist society with Chinese characteristics, there emerged impulsive and excessive tendencies in dealing with the bourgeoisie's policies, which easily transformed into a "leftist" bias towards the policies of democratic parties. Some cadres within the Party did not handle the relationship with democratic parties and non-Party individuals correctly, and at one point adopted policies of excluding them. During the first National United Front Working Conference held in March 1950, there was an opinion that believed democratic parties should not be politically elevated or expanded organizationally; otherwise, it would cause trouble for us. Some even believed that since democratic parties were established to fight for democracy, and now that democracy had been achieved, their mission was complete, and these parties were only "an insignificant factor," and so on. In response to these erroneous tendencies, Mao Zedong pointed out in April of the same year that the lack of emphasis on democratic parties and non-Party individuals was a social phenomenon. It was not only within the Party but also outside the Party. We must make it clear to everyone that democratic parties are necessary in the long run and from an overall perspective. Democratic parties serve as a link between the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, and there must be representatives of them in the political power. It is incorrect to consider democratic parties as an insignificant factor. Looking at the people they are connected to, it is not just one hair, but a whole head of hair, and they should not be underestimated. They should be treated equally, and democracy should be practiced towards them.
In his speech at the National United Front Working Conference, Zhou Enlai also pointed out that all democratic parties, regardless of their names, are still political parties and have a certain level of representation. He criticized the viewpoint that democratic parties could "cause trouble for us," saying, "Democratic parties play a significant role in the people's democratic united front." Our state practices the people's democratic dictatorship and is currently an alliance of four democratic classes. The democratic parties can develop and have prospects for development. We need to cooperate for the long term, make joint efforts, build a new China, and accomplish the tasks entrusted to us by history. He specifically mentioned the bourgeoisie, saying, "Today, the national bourgeoisie still has its historical tasks." He wanted to convey to the bourgeoisie that they should have confidence because they not only have historical tasks, but also a bright future.
In January of the following year, Zhou Enlai once again emphasized in his speech at the tea gathering held by the Central United Front Department that in the construction of New China today, the democratic parties are willing to shoulder their responsibilities, and we should help them integrate into socialism. In the internal unity front, we must handle four aspects of relationships well, namely: class relations, party relations, ethnic relations, and superior-subordinate relations. The peasant class, the capitalist class, and other petite bourgeois classes must be educated for a long time, "not only to educate them to jointly build a new democratic society with us, but also to bring them into the socialist society." He particularly targeted the vague thinking within the party on the issue of the united front, saying that people's democratic dictatorship is the political power of the united front led by the Communist Party, and the issue of the united front should be given more importance. He said, "Due to the long-term conditions of war in the past, we have formed a habit of often issuing orders in the name of the party, especially in the military. Now that we have entered a period of peace and established a national power, this habit should be changed." "We must unite the non-party masses in order to do the work well." The lower-level organs should pay more attention, and non-party members should have their own responsibilities and rights. In addition to poor and hired peasants, representatives of new rich peasants, affluent middle peasants, craftsmen, and intellectuals should also be involved in lower-level political power organizations.
When the Central People's Government was established in 1949, according to the requirements of the "Common Program," non-Communist Party members accounted for a certain proportion in the composition of the Central People's Government and the State Council. However, the policy of long-term cooperation between the Party and the democratic parties did not only exist at the central level, but also manifested in the composition of personnel in local people's governments at all levels. When Mao Zedong approved the list of chairmen of provincial people's governments, he believed that there were too many CCP members and a few representatives of the bourgeoisie should be added. On March 8, 1951, the central government issued a directive, requiring that people's government committees at all levels must be staffed with an appropriate number of non-party members, and suitable candidates should be found among the democratic parties, model workers and peasants, patriotic intellectuals, technical experts, and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs. If the proportion of non-party members in the people's government committee at any level is too small, the higher-level Party committee and the higher-level people's government should not approve or report it. This should become one of the criteria for reviewing the success or failure of united front work in various places.
In accordance with the requirements of the "Common Program" and the repeated emphasis by Mao Zedong and other central leaders, the idea of long-term cooperation between the Party and non-party democratic people gradually became clear and consolidated. Various government departments at all levels conscientiously consulted and solved those issues that needed consultation and resolution with non-party members, enabling them to have responsibilities and rights in their positions, and the conditions to fulfill their duties. In the construction of political power, the implementation of the program of the New Democratic state was carried out to make the superstructure adapt to the level of economic foundation and the development of productivity. This was an important reason for the rapid economic recovery and the smooth progress of various social reforms at that time.
3. Minority Work and Religious Work in the Construction of New Democracy
In all the undertakings carried out at the time, the central government consistently attached great importance to the work of minority groups. In response to the social and economic conditions in minority areas, the central government formulated a reform policy that was different from that in Han areas, emphasizing a cautious and steady approach. In June 1950, Mao Zedong emphasized at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Party that social reform in minority areas is a major matter that must be handled with caution. If there are no conditions among the masses, no people's armed forces, and no minority cadres, then no reform work with mass support should be carried out. In the process of establishing democratic coalition governments in ethnic areas, Mao Zedong also proposed that a large number of ethnic minorities who are willing to cooperate with us should be recruited to participate in government work, and that a large number of minority cadres should be cultivated through this cooperation. In June 1950, Zhou Enlai proposed that in trade with minority areas, more subsidies and expenditures should be provided in order to ensure that ethnic minority compatriots receive more benefits. Cultivating minority cadres should be considered a political task. Minority individuals should hold leadership positions in the governments of autonomous regions. In the People's Congresses of various ethnic groups and sectors, representatives from various minority groups should be included, and the proportion can be increased.
In the spirit of New Democracy, it was also an important policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the beginning of the founding of the country to unite with religious figures. In May 1950, Zhou Enlai pointed out in several discussions at a symposium on Christian issues attended by religious figures and leaders of the Party Central Committee and government departments that religious groups should be independent and self-reliant. Autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating churches should be established. The usefulness of a religious group to the new China should be judged based on two conditions: patriotism and democracy. Believers and non-believers can cooperate and coexist politically, and they should respect each other. We can implement cooperation based on the "Common Program." "We must unite and accommodate various social forces, so that everyone can receive their due and work together to build a new China. Only in this way can society be stable and steadily advance."
4. Ideological and Cultural Education in the New Democratic Revolution
While carrying out economic construction and social reforms, the Party Central Committee began to promote and educate the people with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, making it the guiding ideology for mobilizing all social forces to jointly build New China. At that time, it was necessary to extensively and profoundly carry out ideological and cultural education centered on Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new democratic society, which was national, scientific, and popular. The significance and innovation of the education conducted by the Party lies in the fact that it is guided by Marxism in the context of the new democratic revolution. In May 1951, Liu Shaoqi proposed at the First National Propaganda Work Meeting, "Educating the people throughout the country and on a national scale with the ideological principles of Marxism is the most fundamental political task of our Party." He said, "We must eliminate imperialist thoughts, feudal thoughts, and criticize all non-proletarian thoughts in order to establish the leadership of Marxist and workers' class ideology." This is "a prerequisite for strengthening the leadership of the working class politically and economically." For the ideological systems of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, criticism should be carried out, but they cannot be eliminated, nor can they be completely eliminated. Why is that? Liu Shaoqi explained, "Because today we still allow the existence of the bourgeoisie economically in our policies, and we allow the existence and development of the economy of the petty bourgeoisie and the peasant class. Since we acknowledge their economic existence, we must acknowledge the existence and legitimacy of their thoughts." However, allowing their existence does not mean not engaging in struggle against them. "If we do not refute them, there will be a question of who will defeat whom." "Therefore, although we cannot declare them illegal at present, we must criticize them and point out their errors. Only in this way can the leading position of the working class in ideology be established and ensure the victory of the working class politically and economically, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China." This ideological and cultural line, which is different from both socialism and capitalism, is conducive to preventing and correcting tendencies towards surpassing the stage both economically and politically, and meets the needs of the development of the economic foundation and productive forces of the new democratic society.
5. The Two Types of Contradictions in the New Democratic Society
After the establishment of New China, the sharp class contradictions that existed in society gradually decreased, while a large number of internal contradictions among the people in the new democratic society began to emerge. The characteristics of these new social contradictions and social relations, as well as how they would develop and how to handle these contradictions, were of concern to the Party Central Committee and some senior cadres involved in the construction of New China. At that time, there were different understandings within the Party. In June 1951, while reading relevant articles, Liu Shaoqi wrote in his notes: "When the state of the proletariat has been established and factories have been nationalized, and after the democratic reform has been carried out, there are no longer any class antagonistic and exploitative relations within our state-owned factories. The relationship between the management organs of the factories and the workers has fundamentally transformed into a comradely relationship." He also noted that there were no class contradictions within state-owned factories: "What needs to be dealt with in state-owned factories are no longer class contradictions and exploitative relations, nor the problems arising from such contradictions and relations." Instead, it is "the contradictions and relationships within the working class and the people." These contradictions "must be carefully adjusted and handled during a long period of time," and "we should handle these contradictions and relationships with comradely, reconciliatory, and united methods." The basic contradictions within state-owned factories consist of "the contradictions between the management organs of state-owned factories and the workers, which are the contradictions between the public and the private within state-owned factories." Starting from this point, he further discussed the issue of contradictions in the new democratic society. "Therefore, contradictions can generally be divided into two types: one type is fundamentally antagonistic and cannot be reconciled, while the other type is fundamentally non-antagonistic and can be reconciled. When observing problems, we must distinguish the different nature of these two types of contradictions. Liu Shaoqi started from a specific problem and a particular contradiction, revealing the characteristics of "contradictions among the people" that are universal in the new society. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the two types of contradictions and correctly handling them, reflecting the keen observation and correct analysis of the Party's senior leaders on the new society and new problems, which has significant pioneering significance. Although this discussion was not fully developed at that time due to various reasons, later history has shown that it was the precursor to Mao Zedong formally proposing the theory of correctly handling two types of contradictions in 1956. It was the beginning of the Party's exploration of resolving various social contradictions under the conditions of socialist rule.
6. "Three Years' Preparation, Ten Years' Planned Economic Construction"
At the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee originally planned to restore production in three to five years and then carry out large-scale economic construction. However, the Korean War forced the central authorities to adjust the plan. In February 1951, Mao Zedong proposed the idea of "three years' preparation, ten years' planned economic construction" at an expanded meeting of the Central Political Bureau, based on the fact that the Korean War had stabilized and domestic work was progressing smoothly. The central authorities believed that the Chinese people were confident in completing the task of economic recovery in three years, so it was now necessary to propose the task of preparing for planned economic construction to the Party's leadership cadres. They needed to understand that all the work currently being carried out was directly preparing for the upcoming task of national industrialization.
In May and July of that year, entrusted by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi delivered reports to the cadres attending the First National Propaganda Work Conference and the first batch of students at the Marxist-Leninist College. He elaborated on the important ideas of the Central Committee regarding the "three-year preparation, ten-year planned economic construction". Besides discussing the preparatory work in military, political, cultural, and economic aspects during the "preparation period", the report also specifically addressed the position and significance of this strategic thinking in the entire new democratic society. He said that after the three-year preparation, we will embark on a ten-year economic construction plan. After ten years, China will become a wealthier country than it is now. "Only at that time can our country consider the question of transitioning to socialism. We cannot raise this question now. Some people are already talking about socialism, and I say that it is too early, at least ten years too early." "Socialism cannot be discussed within the ten years of construction. After ten years of good construction, we will assess the situation and then we can bring up the question: when should socialism be implemented? But we still need to consider the actual situation before answering this question. After ten years, certain steps towards socialism may be taken, or maybe at that time it is still not feasible and we will have to wait for a few more years." 
"The new democratic stage is a transitional stage and also a preparatory stage, preparing for the transition to socialism. The three-year preparation and ten-year construction are preparations for the nationalization of industry; it will take a few more years, at least fifteen years, to achieve agricultural collectivization." 
"During the ten-year economic construction, all five economic components should develop." Among them, the development of state-owned enterprises will be rapid, their proportion will increase, and their leadership and control roles will become increasingly important; cooperative economy can develop rapidly, with its proportion and role also increasing; private capitalist economy will increase in absolute numbers, but its proportion will decrease rather than increase; state capitalism will increase; individual economy will also develop and organize more.
In October 1952, Zhou Enlai expressed similar thoughts during a conversation with representatives of certain capitalists: "Regarding the future, I have mentioned Chairman Mao's policy several times before, which is to move forward steadily, recover in three years, and develop in ten or twenty years. It may take ten or twenty years to develop the new democratic economy, and we cannot be so precise about the timeframe." "The industrialization of China is a ten or twenty-year issue. Haste makes waste, we must move forward steadily."
This elucidation of the idea of "three-year preparation, ten-year planned economic construction" reflects the initial views of the Party's central leadership on when to begin the transition to socialism. This strategic deployment of the Party indicates that from 1949 to 1952, the Party's basic idea was that the People's Republic of China is a new democratic country, and it will develop from a new democratic society to a socialist society, which requires a transition period of ten years or more. This is consistent with the "On New Democracy" and the propositions before and after the 7th National Congress of the Party.
From this basic idea, at the First National Organizational Work Conference held by the Central Committee in March 1951, Liu Shaoqi, representing the Central Committee, made a thematic report, based on the Party's Constitution and the prevailing situation at the time, proposing the "Eight Standards for Communist Party Members." The second standard states: "The ultimate goal of the Communist Party of China is to realize the communist system in China. It is now struggling to consolidate the new democratic system, and will strive for the transformation to socialism in the future." The statement "struggling to consolidate the new democratic system" is in line with the understanding and deployment of the central leadership at that time, but it was criticized shortly after the transition to socialism began.
V. Achievements and Deficiencies in the Construction of New Democracy
In the first three years after the establishment of New China, the Party Central Committee, starting from the Chinese national conditions, creatively combined Marxism with the Chinese reality and comprehensively carried out the construction of a new democratic society based on the victory of the new democratic revolution. Whether it is the national system, political system, economic composition, political structure, or their interactions in New China, the socialist model of the Soviet Union was not mechanically copied. Instead, it has made remarkable achievements in the process of the Sinicization of Marxism.
1. Achievements in the Construction of New Democracy
In these three years, under the guidance of the program for the building of a new democratic China, the new China has achieved extensive, profound, and historically significant transformations. In terms of politics, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants has been consolidated and strengthened, consolidating and developing the united front of the four classes. From the central to the local level, even to the streets of the cities and the towns of the countryside, a unified and efficient political system has been firmly established from top to bottom. In terms of economy, through movements such as the confiscation of bureaucratic capital and land reform, various reforms of new democratic nature have been carried out, breaking the shackles of feudal and semi-feudal production relations that hinder the development of productive forces. A socialist state-owned economy and a collective economy have been established, encouraging and supporting state capitalism, private capitalism, and individual economy that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. The mixed economic structure of the five economic components has created a favorable institutional space for the development and vitality of the new China's economy. The unified national financial management has greatly strengthened the state's control over economic operations and resources, which is completely necessary for a backward oriental great power that has just emerged from war and needs to quickly prepare for industrialization. In terms of culture, the old cultural and educational undertakings have been reformed in a step-by-step manner, establishing a new ideology with Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought as the leading ideology, forming a consensus among the entire nation to jointly build a new democratic society.
By combining the restoration of the national economy with social reforms and the adjustment of the interests of various classes, the policies of dividing labor and cooperation among various economic components under the leadership of state-owned economy have been fully implemented, resulting in active urban and rural economies and significant improvement in the social-economic structure. Among the five economic components, state-owned economy has achieved prioritized growth, and cooperative economy, private capitalism, individual economy, and state capitalism have all achieved substantial development, greatly increasing the level of social productivity in a short period of time. While economic recovery and development were taking place, the proportion of socialist economic components gradually increased in the national economy, and the socialist elements in the new democratic economy were continuously strengthened and expanded.
In the profound transformation of economic and social relations, the national economy has achieved comprehensive recovery and initial development. Agricultural production has rapidly developed, and in addition to the rapid recovery of industrial production, a number of urgently needed industrial enterprises have been planned and constructed. By the end of 1952, the total grain output and industrial product output in our country not only exceeded the levels of 1949 but also surpassed the historical peak in 1936. Transportation and postal services have been rapidly restored, promoting the exchange of goods nationwide. National fiscal revenue has multiplied, and the people's living standards have generally improved. These profound changes have ensured that the entire country gradually moves towards the future of socialism along the path of new democracy, setting a good beginning for China's transformation from an agricultural country to an industrial country.
The practice of the first three years after the establishment of New China proved that, under the historical conditions of extremely low level of productive forces and very backward economic base, starting from the actual situation of productive forces, that is, starting from China's national conditions, rather than from the Soviet experience or model, to consider the problem, creating conditions for the transition to socialism through the development of new democratic revolution has been a successful path.
At the beginning of the establishment of New China, the multi-faceted development of new democratic construction further enriched the Party's understanding of the new democratic society that had already formed during the new democratic revolution, and extended and developed it under new historical conditions. It reflects the characteristic of combining Marxism with China's actual situation, accumulates new practical experience for promoting the development of social productive forces, and makes various necessary preparations for completing the great transformation from new democracy to socialism. The practice of these three years is a masterpiece of successfully realizing the sinicization of Marxism, and it concentrates on the characteristic of "extension" of the first historical leap of the sinicization of Marxism under new historical conditions.
2. The inherent contradictions in the new democratic society
However, it should also be noted that in the construction and reform of the early stages of the establishment of New China, there were still some obvious limitations and differences in the party's understanding of some important issues in the development stage of new democracy. This is just as Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his famous speech at the "Spring Couples' Zhai" in July 1951: "Comrades generally have a clear understanding of the historical tasks of our party in the future. That is to transition from the new democratic society to the socialist society, and finally to the communist society." However, "as for the specific way to move forward, the key issues in the process of moving forward, I'm afraid it is not very clear, and there has not been much discussion within the Party. Many comrades have different thoughts and opinions on many issues." These limitations are generally manifested in the following aspects.
Regarding the social nature of New China after its establishment. What is the social nature of China after the establishment of New China? The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that the task of our country after the victory of the new democratic revolution is to steadily "transition from a new democratic state to a socialist state". The "Common Program" also declared that the People's Republic of China is a new democratic state, that is, a people's democratic state. These provisions reflect the historical process of China's revolution and the social nature and development prospects of the early stage of New China. However, in practice, the party's understanding of the nature and characteristics of the new democratic society was still unstable, and there were differences in understanding. In some cases, the Party often equated the concepts of the transitional period mentioned by Marxist classic writers with the new democratic society, and referred to this stage as the transitional period.
The political transitional period mentioned by Marx in the "Critique of the Gotha Program" refers to the transition from capitalist society to the first stage of communist society, that is, socialist society, and the objects analyzed are the capitalist countries with the highest level of development of productive forces at that time. In our country, if we look at the general and broad social development process, it is ok to use the concept of transitional period to define the social nature of the early stage of New China and call this stage the transitional period to socialism. But this broad understanding is not conducive to highlighting the characteristics of the new democratic society, which precisely reflects the innovation and development of Chinese Communists' Marxism, and the new achievements of the Sinicization of Marxism. In our country, the new democratic society established on a very backward basis needs a relatively stable stage of development to provide the political and material foundation for the transition to the socialist society. If there is a lack of specific analysis of the actual social conditions after the establishment of New China, and an inadequate estimation of the development level of China's productive forces, it is often difficult to grasp the uniqueness, difficulty, and long-term nature of the transition from new democracy to socialism, and it is easy to generate a "left" leaning sentiment that is eager to transition to socialism. Obviously, the theory of the transitional period cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the social nature of the early stage of New China. This cannot but have some influence on the correct understanding of the inevitability and necessity of the new democratic society, and on the party's formulation of strategic tasks for this stage and the timely guidance of China's transition to the socialist stage.
Regarding the main contradictions (or basic contradictions) and the main (central) tasks of the new democratic society, the party has had various formulations in the past. In the March 1949 Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Mao Zedong stated that the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, as well as the contradiction between China and imperialist countries, is the main contradiction. In June 1949, Liu Shaoqi also stated in an outline of a report that within the new democratic economy composed of five economic components, there exists a struggle between the socialist elements and tendencies and the capitalist elements and tendencies, which is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the newly established China after the elimination of imperialism and feudal forces. It can be seen that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between socialism and capitalism, was determined as the main contradiction at the beginning of the establishment of new China and became the relatively consistent understanding of the central leadership at that time.
Correspondingly, there is an understanding of the party's main tasks at that time. Mao Zedong pointed out in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that the central task of the party in the liberated areas is "to mobilize all forces to restore and develop the productive enterprise, which is the focal point of all work". Liu Shaoqi also emphasized in June 1949 that "the central task from now on is how to restore and develop China's economy." The economic construction and development of production were unanimously considered by the leadership of the party as the central task during the new democratic period. However, according to the understanding framework in which the main contradiction determines the central task, a problem that is not easily explained arises, which is how to understand the relationship between the two or how to understand the problem of separating the main contradiction from the central work. The arising of this problem reflects, on the one hand, the gap between theory and practice after the rapid victory of the revolution, and on the other hand, the urgent need to update traditional Marxist theory in the face of the reality of the people's democratic state that emerged after the war.
In fact, the party's top leaders at that time had already realized this problem and conducted new thinking. Shortly before the founding of new China, Liu Shaoqi had a new understanding of the main contradictions in the new democratic society. On July 4, 1949, during his visit to the Soviet Union, Liu Shaoqi provided a new explanation of the main contradictions in his report to Stalin. He said that some people claimed that after overthrowing the Kuomintang regime and implementing land reform, "the contradiction between the Chinese proletariat and the bourgeoisie immediately becomes the main contradiction, and the struggle between the workers and capitalists immediately becomes the main struggle". He believed that this statement was incorrect. "Because if a regime predominantly opposes the bourgeoisie, it will gradually turn into proletarian dictatorship. This will drive the patriotic bourgeoisie, who can still cooperate with us, to the side of imperialism. In the current situation in China, implementing such a policy will be a dangerous adventure." The report proposed that "for a considerable period after overthrowing the Kuomintang regime", "the main contradictions and struggles" are still "external contradictions and struggles", namely the contradictions and struggles between the three major enemies and the remnants of the Kuomintang. The contradictions and struggles among different classes and parties within the people's democratic dictatorship, namely internal contradictions and struggles, "will gradually intensify in the future, but compared with external contradictions, it will still occupy a subordinate position for a considerable period of time." The report also stated that "from now in China until the nationalization of general national capital, many steps need to be taken, and a considerable amount of time is needed." It was estimated to take 10 to 15 years. During this period, the working class needs to have necessary and appropriate struggles with the bourgeoisie, but at the same time, "it also needs necessary and appropriate compromises with the national bourgeoisie in order to concentrate forces to deal with external enemies and overcome China's backwardness." Here, Liu Shaoqi's discourse on the main contradiction is obviously different from the provisions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. This should be seen as the development and supplementation of the original understanding by the central committee of the party based on the evolving situation and tasks.
In the period after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and other leaders all recognized Liu Shaoqi's new ideas. In practical work, they not only did not consider the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as the main contradiction in society, but also criticized the view that the national bourgeoisie had become the main target of struggle, which was held by both the party and the public. For example, Mao Zedong expressed similar thoughts at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1950. In April 1950, Mao Zedong made the following comments in the minutes of the speech at the discussion meeting of the United Front Work Conference's industrial and commercial group. On the part of the minutes that mentioned "the main struggle target today is the bourgeoisie," Mao Zedong criticized it, saying "the main struggle target today is imperialism, feudalism, and the remaining reactionary Kuomintang dogs, not the national bourgeoisie. We must fight against the national bourgeoisie, but we must unite with them and adopt a policy of both unity and struggle in order to achieve the goal of uniting and developing the national economy." On the part of the minutes that discussed the restrictions and exclusion of private business, Mao Zedong commented, "We should restrict and exclude those industries and businesses that are not conducive to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as speculative business, luxury goods, and superstitious goods industry, rather than legitimate industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. When these industries and businesses encounter difficulties, they should be assisted to promote their development." On the part of the minutes that mentioned "the state-owned economy should develop without restrictions," Mao Zedong commented, "This is a long-term matter and cannot be developed without restrictions at the present stage. We must also make use of private capital at the same time."
In summary, during the initial two to three years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the central leadership's understanding of this issue was relatively clear and consistent. They emphasized the irreplaceable role of private economy in the development of the national economy, emphasized the unity and utilization of the national bourgeoisie, and criticized the viewpoint that regarded the national bourgeoisie as the main target of struggle, without emphasizing the main contradiction set at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. This difference in expressing the main contradiction and the separation of the main contradiction and main tasks reflects the Party's evolving and changing understanding of these issues, as well as a certain degree of uncertainty in this development. Subsequent practice proved that the result of this development and change was a return to the understanding of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. The understanding of the main contradiction after the establishment of the People's Republic of China at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee not only reflected the grasp of China's national conditions since the introduction of the theory of new democratic revolution, but also reflected the provisions made by classical authors regarding traditional socialist societies. However, in the early days of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, due to the urgent need to rely on the national bourgeoisie and other private enterprises to restore and develop the economy, the Party pragmatically weakened the emphasis on the main contradiction. This phenomenon of contradiction continued to occur even after the "Three-anti" and "Five-anti" campaigns.
In fact, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, as the Communist Party became the ruling party nationwide, the political premise of making economic construction the centerpiece of all work was already in place, and the reality of extreme economic backwardness made the task of recovery and development of production extremely urgent. At this time, it was a correct choice to make the development of production the central task and to regard the contradiction between the people's material and cultural needs and the backwardness of social production as the main contradiction. On the other hand, because many tasks left over from the democratic revolution (such as land reform) remained to be completed, the contradiction between the masses and the remnant forces of the three big enemies should also be placed in a relatively important position. In such a special transition period with multiple tasks and multiple contradictions, the main contradiction should reflect not only the reality that the new democratic revolution has not been completed, but also the pressing economic tasks. The main contradiction during this period thus had a dual, interwoven, and transitional nature. This complex and intricate contradiction situation not only brought difficulties in accurately understanding the main contradiction and the Party's central tasks at that time, but also contained a significant opportunity for the sinicization of Marxism.
Due to the dominance of traditional socialist ideas, as well as the constraints imposed by the Soviet Union's understanding of the main contradictions during the transitional period, people were accustomed to starting from the perspective of class contradictions when determining the main contradictions of society at that time, thinking that the main contradiction of class contradictions was always the main contradiction of social contradictions in any situation. As a result, in the understanding of the main contradiction and the central task of the party, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, was still regarded as the main contradiction in the new democratic society, without aligning it with the guiding principles of the party's economic development-centered work at that time, nor paying attention to its connection with the important tasks (such as land reform) proposed by the party at that time to solve the unfinished democratic revolution.
The existence of these factors has led to several problems. First, the estimation of the duration of the new democratic society has become unstable and tends to become shorter, changing the original idea of constructing a new democratic society over a longer period of time. Second, the understanding of the characteristics of the future socialist society has become increasingly characterized by the Soviet model, which is both "larger" and "purer". Third, the recognition of the importance of utilizing capitalism to develop the economy under extremely backward productive conditions has become indifferent. In such a context of understanding, during this period, when there were "left" errors in dealing with the bourgeoisie and individual economy both within and outside the party, although the central party made a series of efforts to correct them, it was not able to completely suppress them, so that when the situation changed, the tendency to eliminate the bourgeoisie and transition to socialism would re-emerge in new forms. The existence of this situation could not help but affect the implementation of the party's program for the construction of a new democratic state, and could not help but affect the process of Marxist sinification in the early stage of the establishment of the new China.

Chapter 4 New Thinking on the Transition to Socialism and Convergence with the Soviet Model
The Party's 7th Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee of 1949 had clearly defined the development path and steps after the establishment of New China. This involved two interconnected transformations: the transition from an agrarian to an industrial country, and the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. The specific timing and methods for these transformations were proposed by the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong after the 2nd Plenary Session. However, as the objective situation evolved, there were new considerations and significant new development strategies put forward.
I. The Premature Transition to Socialism and its Causes
From the second half of 1952, the domestic and international situations have been developing in a direction favorable to the large-scale construction in our country. Internationally, the situation in the Korean War has basically stabilized, and agreements have been reached on the main issues in the peace talks. It is expected that the war, which New China was forced to wage, will soon come to an end. Domestically, the large-scale land reform has been basically completed nationwide, and other social reforms have progressed smoothly. The work of restoring the national economy has been completed ahead of schedule, and remarkable achievements have been made in the construction of new democratic socialism in all aspects. The original expectation of "recovery in three to five years" was achieved and surpassed the projected targets in just three years. The conditions for large-scale and planned economic construction are already in place.
At this point, another major choice is facing the party. The Party Central Committee, in accordance with the idea of "three years of preparation, ten years of planned economic construction," decided to implement the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy starting from 1953, aiming to transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country. At the same time, the transition to socialism is initiated in advance. This is a new and significant strategic shift. It changes the previous concept of first fully developing under a new democratic system and transitioning to socialism after acquiring certain economic conditions. The decision is made to start the transition to socialism from 1953, instead of more than ten or twenty years later. How did this shift come about and how was it realized?
1. The objective need for an early transition.
From an objective perspective, there are several reasons for the early transition:
First and foremost, this transformation is fundamentally determined by the nature of the Communist Party of China and is an essential part of the Chinese revolution. The achievement of socialism in China has been the striving goal of the Communist Party of China since its inception. The path and methods to achieve socialism had already been clearly stated in the party's revolutionary agenda during the period of new democratic revolution: In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the achievement of socialism had to be carried out in two stages. The first stage was to complete the new democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and the second stage was to transition from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. As for when the revolution would transition to the socialist stage and in what form, the party only indicated in general that it was an inevitable trend of historical development and the conditions required, without making specific judgments and estimations about the timing and conditions of the transition, as this needed to be determined based on the specific circumstances in the development of the revolution.
Starting from the later stage of the War of Liberation, especially after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee began to discuss this issue more frequently and specifically. At that time, the idea was to establish a new democratic state after the victory of the new democratic revolution. After 10 to 15 years of economic construction in the new democratic period, with the development of industry and the growth of the state-owned economy, the industrialization and collectivization of agriculture would be implemented to realize the transition from the new democratic revolution to socialism. This was seen as a "relatively long" historical process. For example, in September 1949, Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, explained why the "Common Program" did not include China's socialist future, stating, "Because it will take a considerable amount of time for China to take serious socialist steps, it is something that will take quite a while in the future." During this conference, when a delegate asked Mao Zedong how long it would take to transition to socialism, he replied, "Probably about twenty or thirty years." By 1952, as the restoration period was coming to an end, due to the development of the situation, accumulated new experiences, and a new understanding of the steps for socialist transformation, certain important changes occurred to the original plan. The Party Central Committee believed that the gradual transition to socialism could begin immediately and it was estimated that it would take 15 years or a bit longer to complete. Therefore, from a fundamental perspective, the goals and ideals of the struggle remain unchanged, but what has changed is that the timeline has been moved forward and accelerated.
Secondly, the outbreak of the Korean War placed the urgent task of prioritizing the development of heavy industry in front of the party. 
The eruption of the Korean War quickly worsened China's international environment and posed a serious threat to national security. China had to confront the world's leading economic power, the United States, on the Korean battlefield despite the disparity in strength. The backward economic strength and military equipment exposed during the Korean War shocked the party's leaders, compelling them to urgently hope to change China's extremely weak industrial foundation, especially in heavy industry, and narrow the gap with developed Western countries. This was one of the direct reasons for giving birth to the priority development of heavy industry to drive national industrialization.
In the eve of the establishment of the New China and the early days of the New China, the party generally believed that our country's economy was backward, the industrial foundation was weak, funds were scarce, and industrialization should start with prioritizing the development of agriculture and light industry, which required less investment and brought quick results, in order to accumulate funds for the development of heavy industry that required large investments and long construction periods. Liu Shaoqi once envisioned this development as a "three-step process": the first step is to mainly develop agriculture and light industry, while also establishing necessary defense industries; the second step is to vigorously develop heavy industry after having the necessary foundation; the third step is to greatly develop light industry and mechanize agricultural production based on the already established and developed heavy industry. He explained that only when agriculture develops can it provide sufficient raw materials and food for industry and expand the market for industrial development; only when light industry develops can it exchange a large amount of industrial products for the raw materials and food produced by farmers and accumulate funds for further industrial development. The development of agriculture and light industry can quickly improve the long-term low living standards of the people, further politically unite the entire people. Only then is it possible to concentrate the largest amount of funds and resources to build all the foundations for and develop heavy industry. In accordance with this development mindset, the role of a mixed economic structure is highly prominent.
In the first three years after the establishment of the New China, although the national economy was restored and developed to a certain extent, the backwardness of the industrial sector did not fundamentally change. By 1952, the steel production was only over 1.3 million tons, and the output value of modern industries using machinery accounted for only 28% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. Mao Zedong once sighed, "What can we produce now? We can produce tables and chairs, tea bowls and teapots, we can grow food, grind it into flour, and we can make paper. However, we cannot produce a car, an airplane, a tank, or a tractor." The backward reality and the severe international environment made the party's leaders realize that the ability to quickly change the extremely weak industrial foundation of China and catch up with advanced industrial countries is related to the maintenance of national security under the serious threat of imperialism, and is related to the future and destiny of the country and the nation. If according to the original plan, to first implement a mixed economy of new democracy for more than a decade or a longer period of time, first develop agriculture and light industry, and then develop heavy industry when the capital accumulation reaches a certain level, although industrialization can also be achieved, it would be a long road and not suitable for China, a backward socialist country under the conditions of the Cold War.
It was precisely under such a background that after the basic completion of the task of restoring the national economy, the Central Committee of the Party took the opportunity to put the task of realizing industrialization with heavy industry at its core on the agenda. In May 1952, when formulating the first Five-Year Plan, Li Fuchun, on behalf of the Financial and Economic Committee, proposed to focus the economic construction on heavy industry to lay the foundation for China's industrialization; agriculture, light industry, transportation, and other sectors should develop around the center of heavy industry. This was an important decision to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Mao Zedong summarized the origin and characteristics of this development strategy in a highly concise manner. He said: In order to ensure national independence, the focus should be placed on heavy industry to strengthen national defense and advance towards socialism. In this way, based on the new situation and tasks encountered after the establishment of New China, the development strategy of first agriculture, then light industry, and then heavy industry in the system of new democratic regime was changed, and the priority was given to the development of heavy industry, followed by the development of light industry and agriculture. Achieving national industrialization became the main task of the country in the future, which marked a major strategic shift for the Party. This development strategy of industrialization as the center and rapid development is a common choice for most newly independent developing countries, especially socialist countries, in the post-war world. It is particularly noteworthy that such a change in development strategy must be accompanied by corresponding institutional changes as a basic guarantee. In China, this also means that it is necessary to enter socialism in advance.
The biggest difference between achieving industrialization first and first developing agriculture and light industry lies in the need for a large amount of capital investment and the emergence of a large capital gap. Prioritizing the development of heavy industry highlights this contradiction. At that time, our country's industrial foundation was even weaker than that of the Soviet Union during the implementation of its first Five-Year Plan. After the land reform, the decentralized and backward individual economy was difficult to meet the rapidly growing needs of cities and industries for capital, food, and agricultural raw materials. Faced with this contradiction, it was not possible for us to obtain the starting capital for industrialization through overseas expansion and plunder like the early capitalist countries, nor could we solve the huge capital required for the development of heavy industry from the dispersed and backward agricultural and light industrial sectors. We had to find other ways. Regardless of whether there was sufficient awareness at that time, and regardless of the extent to which the considerations were based on practical or ideological factors, the practical approach could only be through a highly centralized government, adopting a planned economic system, primarily through planning rather than the market, and through strong administrative power to achieve internal accumulation and resource allocation to meet the huge demand for various funds and resources in the initial stage of industrialization. It was this urgent development need that placed the task of transitioning to socialism ahead of us.
The recovery of the industry and the start of a large number of new projects have greatly increased the demand for food and other industrial raw materials. However, the dispersed and fragile individual farmers after the land reform have very limited capacity for expanding reproduction, which cannot meet the needs of large-scale industrial construction. At that time, the fact that simple cooperation in mutual aid groups and initial cooperativization could significantly increase production convinced the party that further cooperativization could more rapidly promote the development of productive forces and meet the urgent demands of industrialization for agricultural products.
After three years of recovery, new contradictions also appeared and accumulated in China's social and economic development. In rural areas, the differentiation between the rich and the poor after the land reform forced the party to consider the direction of development for individual economy. This not only relates to the stability and development of the vast rural areas, but also sharply raises several fundamental ideological questions for the party: Should we adopt private ownership or public ownership? Should we pursue socialism or capitalism? Should we promote individual economy or collective economy?
Thirdly, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis" movements and the return to the main contradictions in the 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee.
In understanding the main contradictions in China after the establishment of the New China, Mao Zedong had principled expressions in works such as "On the United Front Government." From the Central Work Conference in September 1948 to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, this understanding became more explicit, namely the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, even at this time, there was still a lack of thoroughness and consistency in the understanding of the main contradictions. For example, Mao Zedong's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee lacked logical consistency between the expression of the basic contradiction (i.e., the main contradiction) and the definition of the central task. Afterwards, the central leaders made new judgments on the main contradictions, indicating that there had been changes in understanding. They had repeatedly criticized the view that the national bourgeoisie was the main target of struggle, but there was still no clear consensus on this, and there was a lack of firm and consistent understanding on the issue of the main contradictions. This contradiction and fluctuation in understanding can be understood, as it reflects changes in the party's long-term goals and short-term goals, value pursuits and strategic considerations, considerations for the restoration and development of production, and responses to the new situation in class struggle. This lack of consistency and clarity in understanding has changed and developed due to changes in the understanding of the national bourgeoisie caused by the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns.
Some changes in understanding the national bourgeoisie were important reasons for the Central Committee's decision to make an early transition to socialism. At the beginning of the establishment of New China, based on a scientific understanding of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie and in accordance with the provisions of the "Common Program" to protect the legitimate operation and appropriate development of private industry and commerce, the Party had always pursued the policy of unity, utilization, and transformation, with the emphasis on utilization. In the process of restoring the national economy, the lawless elements among the capitalists were not satisfied with obtaining normal profits through legitimate means, but attempted to use illegal methods such as bribing state officials, tax evasion, shoddy work, embezzlement of state property, and theft of state economic intelligence (referred to as the "Five Evils" at the time) to obtain illegal high profits. In response to this serious situation, the Party Central Committee decided to launch the "Three-Anti" campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy among party and government personnel, and the "Five-Anti" campaign against bribery, tax evasion, shoddy work, embezzlement of state property, and theft of state economic intelligence among private industrial and commercial entities.
The grand "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns not only dealt a powerful blow to lawless capitalists, but also caused strong ideological shock among the party members and cadres, resulting in important changes in their understanding of the national bourgeoisie. In the process of exposing the "Five Evils" behavior of the lawless capitalists and criticizing the bourgeois ideology, some cadres and masses inevitably developed some extremist emotions. In early 1952, the magazine "Study," edited by the Theoretical Department of the Publicity Department, published a series of articles that violated the "Common Program" and contained principled errors. These articles unilaterally denied the dual nature of the bourgeoisie at the current stage, believing that the bourgeoisie only had a reactionary and decadent side and not a positive side, obliterating the position and role of the bourgeoisie in the stage of New Democracy. The articles demanded that the bourgeoisie, as a class, accept the ideological system of Marxism. Mao Zedong sternly criticized the errors in these articles, and the Publicity Department made a self-criticism. On March 27, 1952, Mao Zedong wrote in another instruction: "In the period of New Democracy, i.e., the period when the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie are allowed to exist," "within the period when the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie are allowed to exist, it is not allowed for the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie to have their own stand and ideology. This kind of thinking is divorced from Marxism, it is a childish and ridiculous thought," "it should be corrected." Here, Mao Zedong's understanding of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideology still adhered to the consistent position of the Party as stipulated in the "Common Program" and the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, which was different from the expression at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Or it can be said that in March, Mao Zedong emphasized the position of the "Common Program" more.
However, with the proposal of the socialist industrialization task, especially with the development of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the side of the bourgeoisie seeking only profit became more exposed and came into sharp conflict with the values of the Communists. As the anarchic impulses of capitalist industry and the highly centralized planned economic system needed for national industrialization continued to develop, the struggle between the working class, state-owned economy, and the bourgeoisie, with limitations and counter-restrictions, became increasingly prominent. At this time, the attention of the central leadership quickly shifted to this increasingly prominent contradiction, further deepening their understanding of the negative role of the bourgeoisie and capitalist economy, and constantly clarifying that the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie is the primary contradiction of the transitional period. Three months later, as the movement was drawing to a close, Mao Zedong's understanding of the bourgeoisie underwent an obvious change. On June 6, 1952, in a directive, he proposed: "After overthrowing the landlord class and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, the main contradiction within China is the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie should no longer be referred to as the intermediate class." To express the main contradiction in this way actually returned to the consistent expression from the Central Political Bureau Meeting in September 1948 until the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. The view that the national bourgeoisie is an intermediate class was negated, ending the party's vacillation on this fundamental issue. Three months later, Mao Zedong changed his vision of gradually transitioning from new democracy to socialism and proposed the issue of starting the transition to socialism.
Subsequent history has shown that, although at the start of large-scale economic construction, the negative factors of private capitalist economy objectively called for the transformation of private economy by narrowing its scope of operation through the support of state-owned economy and centralized planning, the degree and speed of this transformation could have been more cautious. This change in understanding of the national bourgeoisie through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements weakened the important aspect of Chinese characteristics in the theory of new democracy and took a significant step closer to the Soviet model of the Stalin era.
Fourthly, the country began planned economic construction, which required concentrating limited resources and funds on key construction projects, while private capitalist economy instinctively aimed to expand free production and trade to develop itself and instinctively rejected planned management of the economy. If the contradiction between planned management and free development was not prominent in the recovery period, it became pronounced after the comprehensive start of the first five-year plan. The only way to resolve this contradiction was to accelerate the pace of private economic transformation, increase the intensity of the transformation, and make it compatible with the planned economy.
Fifthly, during the "Five-Year Plan" period, China received a large amount of assistance from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union. These tangible materials and funds all bore the invisible imprint of planned economy and corresponding economic system of public ownership, which can only be aligned with our country's public economy and economic system. This not only deepened the dependence of private economy on state-owned economy, but also highlighted the necessity of socialist transformation of private economy.
2. Favorable conditions for early transition
The early transition to socialism not only had practical objective needs, but also had certain favorable conditions at that time.
First, at that time, our country already had a relatively strong and rapidly developing socialist state-owned economy, which was not only an important force for the socialist transformation of the entire national economy, but also an important beginning of the transformation. After three years of recovery, there was a fundamental change in the proportion of public and private economy in the national economy. For example, in the total industrial output value nationwide (excluding handicraft industry), state-owned industries increased from 34.2% in 1949 to 52.8% in 1952, and collective-cooperative and joint state-private industries accounted for 82%, while private industries decreased from 63.3% to 39%. At that time, most state-owned industries were technologically advanced, with relatively high labor productivity. The workers in state-owned enterprises had a strong sense of ownership, stable lives, enjoyed various rights and benefits, and had a high enthusiasm for labor. In summary, the socialist economy clearly demonstrated its superiority over other economic components. Such changes indicate that the dominant position of the socialist state-owned economy in the entire national economy has significantly strengthened. It not only controls important industries and sectors related to national economy and people's livelihood but also surpasses private industries in modern industry, becoming the main material foundation for China's gradual transition to socialism. China can only rely primarily on the development of the socialist state-owned economy to achieve industrialization.
Second, the party has already carried out many practices of utilizing and restricting private industry and commerce, accumulating a lot of experience, which is actually the initial step in the socialist transformation of the capitalist economy. During the period of national economic recovery, in the process of restricting and counter-restricting the capitalist economy and in the process of reasonably adjusting industry and commerce, the state created a series of state capitalist forms from low to high levels, such as processing and ordering, distribution and agency sales, unified purchasing and retail sales, and joint state-private enterprises. These forms not only utilized and restricted capitalist industry and commerce but also deepened their connection with socialist state-owned economy and planned economy, causing varying degrees of changes in their production relations. In fact, they also began the initial socialist transformation to different degrees, although this was not fully realized at the beginning. Prior to this, the party's understanding of measures for achieving socialist transformation took a "considerable period" of time and was based on the development of industry and the growth of state-owned economy, and it took a decisive socialist step by nationalizing capitalist industry and implementing the collectivization of individual agriculture at one go. From 1952 onwards, through investigations, research, and summarizing experiences, the Central Committee of the Party realized that continuing to expand and enhance various forms of state capitalism could serve as a specific approach to gradually transform capitalist industry and commerce into socialism. This understanding became another fundamental factor for the party to propose the general line of a gradual transition to socialism at this time.
Third, after the completion of the land reform throughout the country, a simple cooperative agriculture and mutual aid cooperation movement was widely launched in rural areas, demonstrating the initial superiority of organizing individual farmers to increase agricultural production. The party also accumulated a lot of experience in carrying out agricultural mutual aid cooperation in this process. At that time, it was believed that these forms of mutual aid cooperation were not only effective in helping poor farmers overcome difficulties and increase production but also the appropriate forms to prevent the spontaneous trend of rural capitalism and guide agriculture towards socialism. In the debate on the Shanxi cooperative movement, the party also formed a new understanding that industrialization and agricultural mechanization in China would be a long process, and agricultural cooperatives could not wait for industrialization and mechanization. Under conditions without large machinery, small-scale agricultural mutual aid organizations mainly relied on unified operation and cooperation, which could also increase production. This is also one of the fundamental factors for the party to propose the general line of a gradual transition to socialism.
Fourth, the reason why the central government made the decision to prioritize the development of heavy industry and advance the transition to socialism is not only due to ideological reasons, but also because of the influence of the international environment that should not be ignored. The birth of New China took place in an international environment where capitalism and socialism were sharply confrontational. Therefore, after the establishment of New China, we chose the diplomatic policy of "leaning to one side" and became a member of the socialist camp. Imperialist countries led by the United States posed military threats and imposed strict economic blockades on our country, constantly stirring up anti-China and anti-communist activities. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries, on the other hand, provided positive assistance and support to China. At that time, the socialist camp was full of vitality and demonstrated the superiority of socialism over capitalism. Since the birth of the first socialist country, through the comparison of the capitalist economic crisis in the 1920s and 1930s and the post-war economic recovery, the socialist development model with public ownership and a planned economy as the mainstay has great appeal for backward countries to achieve leapfrog development in the short term.
3. The proposal of the general line for the transitional period
In the above-mentioned practical and cognitive background, under the interaction of various factors, by the second half of 1952, the central government had begun to consider how China would gradually transition to socialism. On September 24, 1952, when the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns were about to end, Mao Zedong raised the issue of transitioning to socialism at a meeting of the Central Secretariat. He said: We must start now and basically complete the transition to socialism in 10 to 15 years instead of starting the transition in 10 years or after 10 years. (7th) The Second Plenary Session put forward the concept of restriction and counter-restriction, which is now more enriched. In November, he said at a central meeting that we should eliminate the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie industry and commerce, but we should do it step by step, both eliminating and supporting. Later, during his inspection tour in Hubei, he said: What is the transitional period? The steps of the transitional period are towards socialism. It is like crossing a bridge, one step is equivalent to a one-year transition, two steps are equivalent to a two-year transition, three steps are equivalent to a three-year transition, and it takes ten to fifteen years to complete the transition. Compared with the party's initial proposal for the transition to socialism in the early days of New China, Mao Zedong's new proposal has undergone considerable changes.
In October 1952, Liu Shaoqi led a delegation from the Communist Party of China (CPC) to attend the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During this time, he was entrusted by Mao Zedong to write a letter to Stalin, seeking his opinions on the CPC Central Committee's ideas of gradually transitioning agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry into socialism within a period of 10 to 15 years. Stalin affirmed this proposal, stating: "After we seize power, we should adopt a method of gradually transitioning to socialism. Your attitude towards the Chinese bourgeoisie is correct."
Upon receiving Stalin's affirmation, the CPC Central Committee further solidified its new concept of transitioning to socialism. In April 1953, Mao Zedong wrote in an outline: "Within a period of ten to fifteen years or even longer, we will basically complete national industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry." In mid-June, Mao Zedong formally proposed during a meeting of the Central Political Bureau: "The overall guiding principles and tasks of the Party during the transition period are to basically accomplish national industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry within a period of ten to fifteen years or even longer. This general line serves as the beacon guiding all our work." In August, while reviewing a document, Mao Zedong provided a more comprehensive textual expression of the overall guiding principles during the transition period for the first time: "From the establishment of the People's Republic of China until the basic completion of socialist transformation, this is a transition period. The overall guiding principles and tasks of the Party during this transition period are to, within a considerably long period of time, basically achieve national industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry."
To meet the needs of studying and propagating the overall guiding principles, in December 1953, the CPC Central Committee endorsed the "Outline for Studying and Propagating the Party's Overall Guiding Principles during the Transition Period: Struggling to Mobilize All Forces to Build Our Country into a Great Socialist State" (referred to as the "Propaganda Outline"), which was compiled by the Central Publicity Department and modified by Mao Zedong. The Propaganda Outline finalized the complete expression of the overall guiding principles during the transition period as follows: "From the establishment of the People's Republic of China until the basic completion of socialist transformation, this is a transition period. The overall guiding principles and tasks of the Party during this transition period are, within a considerably long period of time, to gradually achieve national socialist industrialization and, step by step, realize socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry. This general line serves as the beacon guiding all our work. Deviation from it will lead to right-leaning or 'left-leaning' mistakes in our work."
The party's general line during the transitional period takes the starting point of the transitional period from the establishment of New China. This is a significant development and transformation of the revolutionary nature, social nature, theory of the new democratic society, and the theory of transition to socialism since the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Mao Zedong and other central leaders sensed this major change and attempted to explain it. He added an explanation in the study and propaganda outline: "When we say that the change in the nature of the revolution and the end of the basic stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of socialist revolution are marked, it means a change in political power, the elimination of the counterrevolutionary political power of the Kuomintang, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It does not mean that the great task of socialist transformation can immediately be carried out in all aspects of the country after the establishment of the People's Republic of China." "At that time, the main contradiction in the countryside was between feudalism and democracy, not between capitalism and socialism, so it was necessary to spend two to three years to carry out land reform in the countryside. At that time, we, on the one hand, implemented democratic land reform in the countryside, and on the other hand, immediately began to take over the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises in the cities and transformed them into socialist enterprises; "We started to establish socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce nationwide, and implemented state capitalism measures on private capitalist enterprises over the past few years. All of these show the complex image of the first few years of our country's transitional period." Mao Zedong's use of the term "complex image" here probably also meant to illustrate the changes in the understanding of the main contradiction in the first three years after the establishment of New China. 
Zhou Enlai explained this issue from the intrinsic connection between the two social forms. He clearly pointed out at the expanded standing committee meeting of the National People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1953: "In a centralized sense, during the period of the construction of our new democratic society, it is the period of gradually transitioning to socialism, and it is also the period where the proportion of socialist economic components gradually increases in the national economy." This means that our new democratic society belongs to the socialist system and is a transitional social nature gradually transitioning to socialist society. This also helps to explain the claim that the general line of the transitional period starts from the establishment of New China. 
2. The basic characteristics of the general line of the transitional period
1. "The 'One Central Task, Three Major Changes' and its emphasis
There are two basic characteristics of the general line during the transition period: one is advancement, and the other is the combination of two major aspects. The so-called advancement means changing the originally envisioned path of a relatively long period of new democratic construction, after considerable development of productive forces, to transition to socialism. It proposes to start the transition from 1953, greatly reducing the period of new democratic construction. The combination of two major aspects refers to the "One Central Task, Three Major Changes" or "the Coexistence of One Core and Two Wings". The core is the gradual realization of socialist industrialization, while the "two wings" refer to the progressive socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The prominent feature of this general line is the simultaneous advancement of national industrialization and socialist transformation. That is, the simultaneous development of productive forces and the transformation of relations of production. While giving priority to the development of heavy industry to achieve industrialization, the private ownership of the means of production is gradually transformed.
Regarding the task of gradually realizing socialist industrialization, the requirement of the general line is to fully develop socialist industry and transform the existing non-socialist industry into socialist industry, making socialist industry the leading force in the development of the national economy. As for the task of gradually realizing socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, the regulation of the general line is to expand socialist public ownership and collective ownership of cooperative members, transforming the private ownership of farmers and craftsmen based on individual labor into collective ownership of cooperative members, and transforming the capitalist private ownership based on the exploitation of the working class's surplus labor into public ownership."
The general line of the transitional period developed the theory of the transition from Marxism to socialism by classical Marxist writers. In the relevant theories of Marx and Engels, the transition from capitalism to socialism or communism should be a transition from developed capitalist countries to socialism or communism. In these countries, the highly developed productive forces are already justified. Therefore, in their theory of the transitional period, they do not deliberately emphasize the problem of industrialization and the development of productive forces, but mainly emphasize the revolutionary transformation of the economic base and the superstructure. The practice of socialism in the 20th century went beyond the imagination of Marx and Engels, and most of it took place in backward countries, which promoted the development of the theory of the transitional period of Marxism. In the practice of transitioning to socialism in the Soviet Union, due to the reality of its backward economy and culture, in Lenin and Stalin's standards for building socialism, in addition to the elimination of exploitation and the realization of industrial nationalization and agricultural collectivization, an emphasis was placed on the industrialization of the country. The socialist countries that emerged after World War II also associated the transition to socialism with industrialization due to their relatively backward level of productivity. In fact, this should be regarded as the development of classical Marxist theories under contemporary conditions, or rather, it is an important achievement of the modernization of Marxism.
When the Central Committee put forward the general line of the transitional period, it drew on the experience of the Soviet Union and made industrialization the main task of China's transition to socialism. Mao Zedong's words succinctly summarize the essence and characteristics of this general line, which is "the revolution of the social system from private ownership to public ownership" combined with "the revolution of technology from handicraft industry to large-scale modern machine production." This is different from Marx's theory of transition and is the development of classical Marxist theory.
However, it should also be noted that the proposal of the general line of the transitional period has brought about significant changes in the approach, methods, time, and specific policies of the transition from new democracy to socialism originally envisioned by the Central Committee. In connection with the great shortening of the period of new democracy, Mao Zedong changed the understanding of the nature of new democratic society before and after the founding of New China, changed the provisions of the "Common Program" regarding the nature of New China, and changed the understanding of the starting point of the transition. The general line of the transitional period changed the understanding and stipulation that our country's transitional period is a transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society and replaced it with the assertion that it is a transition from capitalism to socialism. Obviously, the social form before the establishment of New China was not a "capitalist" society, but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This was the starting point for the entire new democratic revolution and the theory of the new democratic society. If it were "capitalist," then China's revolution would not be of a new democratic nature. This judgment contradicts the understanding of the Communist Party, including the Report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, during the democratic revolution period. When proposing the general line, Mao Zedong also criticized the three "wrong views" of establishing the social order of new democracy, transitioning from new democracy to socialism, and ensuring private property. As for the time to complete the transition, it was initially envisioned as three five-year plans, plus three years of national economic recovery, totaling 18 years. Although it has been shortened compared to the past, if it can be effectively implemented, the problem is not very big. This reflects that Mao Zedong was relatively cautious in guiding ideology at that time.
Although there is a distinction between the "main body" and the "two wings" in the general line, which puts the development of productive forces and the transformation of production relations in parallel, and emphasizes that the main body is industrialization, in practical implementation and understanding, there is more emphasis on the transformation of production relations, highlighting the counteraction between the superstructure and production relations, and does not regard the development of productive forces as the decisive factor in achieving collectivization. Mao Zedong said in two discussions on agricultural mutual aid cooperation in October 1953, "The general line can also be said to be the solution to the problem of ownership", "The general line is gradually changing the production relations", "Private ownership must gradually become illegal". Later, he even proposed, "Our goal is to make capitalism extinct, to make it extinct on Earth." In September 1953, Zhou Enlai said at the 49th Standing Committee of the First Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "What is socialism? The most fundamental aspect of socialism is the completion of socialist transformation, which means the abolition of private capitalist ownership of the means of production, nationalization, and the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts." The study and propaganda outline of the Central Propaganda Department on the party's general line during the transitional period also states, "The essence of the party's general line during the transitional period is to make the socialist ownership of the means of production the only economic foundation of our country and society." In other words, between productive forces and production relations, more emphasis is placed on production relations. It is precisely this point that makes the general line during the transitional period different from the idea of transitioning from the construction of new democracy to socialism.
In terms of the steps in agricultural development, the idea of achieving industrialization first and then collectivization has been changed. The original idea was to concentrate efforts on achieving national industrialization first, and only when industry could provide a large number of agricultural machinery, would it be possible to achieve collectivization. However, now it is believed that cooperation can be achieved without mechanization, and collective farming can be implemented first, followed by mechanization. This is what Mao Zedong meant by saying, "We must have collectivization first, and then we can use large machinery."
In terms of the policies towards capitalist industry and commerce, there has been a change from the idea of first utilizing and restricting these sectors, and leveraging their advantages for the national economy and people's livelihood, and then, when conditions are ripe, nationalizing them through legislation, to proposing the simultaneous utilization and restriction of the capitalist economy, and transforming it through various forms of state capitalism, gradually bringing it onto the socialist track, and so on.
The changes reflected in the general line during the transitional period indicate that the Party's understanding deepens gradually with the development of practice. Originally, it was envisaged that after a period of 10 to 15 years of construction of new democratic society, the socialist society would be smoothly entered with a certain economic and material foundation. Now it seems that since the establishment of New China, socialist elements have been continuously growing and undoubtedly surpassing the development of private enterprises, increasingly strengthening their controlling power. This indicates that the current period of construction of new democratic society can also be regarded as a transitional period from new democratic society to socialism, that is, a period when the proportion of socialist economic elements in the national economy gradually increases. It should also be noted that although this transformation has not changed the Party's strategic goals and main tasks, it has had a significant impact on subsequent developments in terms of understanding of the nature of society, understanding of the main contradictions in society, understanding of non-public ownership economy, and the transition to socialism. These changes are not only a development of Marxist classical theory in response to changes in the situation, but also an extension of China's existing experience based on practical needs. They also reflect the beginning of simply copying the Soviet model and abandoning some aspects of the original new democratic social theory that were more in line with China's national conditions.
2. "What happens in the Soviet Union today will happen in our country tomorrow"
The general line of the transitional period is directly based on Lenin's theory of the transitional period, and the proposal of the general line signifies that we have to a considerable extent accepted the Soviet model. As the first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction has direct reference significance for China. As early as before and after the establishment of New China, the Party Central Committee had repeatedly proposed learning from the Soviet Union as a model. In June 1949, Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher, and we must learn from them," and "learn with respect and sincerity." On September 3, 1949, Liu Shaoqi called for learning from the Soviet Union at a meeting of senior Party cadres: "We must learn from the Soviet Union in politics, organization, ideology, technology, law, finance, economy, culture, education, and other aspects." However, in the early stage of the establishment of New China, facing the completion of a large number of democratic revolution tasks such as comprehensive economic recovery, especially land reform, the Party emphasized that "the main object of struggle today is imperialism, feudalism, and the remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang, not the national bourgeoisie"; emphasized that "some people think that it is possible to eliminate capitalism early and implement socialism, this kind of thinking is wrong and not suitable for our country's situation"; emphasized the implementation of the "Common Program" and the comprehensive development of new democratic construction. In other words, it emphasized the implementation of the program for building a new democratic nation, rather than transitioning to socialism. Although it was influenced by Lenin's "New Economic Policy," it was more of the Chinese Communist Party's exploration and creation of a new democratic theory with Chinese characteristics during the long-term new democratic revolution. In this context, the emphasis on learning from the Soviet experience and model was not prominent.
During the process of formulating, proposing, and implementing the general line of the transitional period, there was a wave of studying the Soviet socialist experience under the leadership of the Party Central Committee. The Central Committee presented the specific content of the study to the whole party, considering it an important aspect and condition for implementing the general line.
In February 1953, Mao Zedong issued a call at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We should start a wave of studying the Soviet Union to build our country." He emphasized that we needed to carry out the great five-year plan for construction, which was a difficult task with insufficient experience, so we needed to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. "We should now study the Soviet Union extensively, learn their advanced experience in various departments, invite their advisors, and send our students abroad." On this issue, we should adopt a sincere attitude, learn all their strengths, not only the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, but also their advanced science and technology. We should be humble and learn everything we need. On February 14, 1953, Liu Shaoqi pointed out in a speech: "We must make efforts to learn from the Soviet Union and consider learning and applying their advanced experience with an open mind as one of the conditions for advancing our national construction." On the same day, the People's Daily published an editorial saying: "For the realization of industrialization in our country, the most important thing ahead of us is to learn from the Soviet Union", "We should quickly launch a systematic movement to study the Soviet Union nationwide." In December 1953, the Central Propaganda Department issued the outline for propaganda of the general line of the transitional period, stating: "The path that the Soviet Union has taken in the past is the example we need to learn from today." On September 15, 1954, Liu Shaoqi said in the report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "The path we have taken is the path the Soviet Union has taken, there is no doubt about it. The path of the Soviet Union is the path that humanity's society must inevitably take according to the laws of historical development. It is impossible to avoid this path." For a time, "the present of the Soviet Union is our future" became a well-known slogan.
During the process of formulating and implementing the general line, in April 1953, the Party Central Committee issued the "Instructions on the Theory Education of Cadres in 1953-1954". The instructions stated: "In order to meet the needs of the entire party entering the period of economic construction, it is now stipulated that the senior and middle-level groups for theoretical study of cadres across the party should study chapters 9 to 12 of 'History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)' and some works on socialist economic construction by Lenin and Stalin from July 1953 to December 1954, a period of one and a half years. This study plan requires that the main cadres of the entire party be able to systematically understand the basic laws of the Soviet Union's realization of national industrialization, agricultural cooperation, and socialist construction, so as to correctly utilize the Soviet Union's experience in our country's economic construction based on our specific conditions." The instructions required the senior group to study 26 works by individuals such as Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Molotov, and Malenkov during the study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". These include Lenin's "Economic and Political Problems of the Epoch of Proletarian Dictatorship", "On the Question of the Unity of Economic Planning", "On Grain Tax", "On the Cooperative System", Stalin's "On the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policies", "On Several Issues of Soviet Land Policy", "Victory Has Gone to Our Heads", "Summing Up the First Five-Year Plan", and so on. These classic works, which laid the theoretical foundation of the Soviet model, have had a profound and long-lasting impact on China's socialist construction.
For example, the emphasis on the importance of production relations over productive forces in the socialist transformation is a distinctive feature of the Stalinist model. When Stalin declared the completion of socialism in 1936, the main basis for this declaration was not the standards of productive forces and production socialization, but the "abolition of a capitalist society and the establishment of a socialist society" in terms of production relations. He stated that the "most important" aspect of completing socialism was that capitalism had been completely eliminated from the industrial sector in our country, and that the socialist mode of production now dominated the industrial sector. In the agricultural sector, "kulaks have also been eliminated," and a "comprehensive system of collective farms and state farms" has been formed, where "individual small-scale farming has a very small role". In short, the phenomenon of "man exploiting man" has been eradicated and eliminated, and socialist ownership of the means of production and the means of production has been firmly established as the unshakable foundation of Soviet society. Although Stalin also mentioned the achievements of Soviet industrial and agricultural production at that time in terms of productive forces, he did not consciously link socialism with a certain level of productive forces, which was quite different from the vision of Marx and Lenin. When we consider the Three Major Transformations in our country, the influence of the Stalinist model is quite evident.
Following the requirements of the central government, the entire party has significantly increased its consciousness in implementing the general line by systematically understanding the experience of building socialism in the Soviet Union. By referring to important speeches by central leaders such as Mao Zedong, the party has deepened its understanding of the significance and complexity of socialist industrialization, the leading role of the working class in the industrial and agricultural alliance, and the importance of strengthening party leadership. It has also improved its understanding of the various difficulties encountered in the industrialization process, such as insufficient agricultural and industrial products, and the necessity and importance of central planning and unified purchasing and sales. This learning movement has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the unity of thought, the implementation of the general line, the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, and the future socialist construction in our country. It has also had a great impact on establishing and popularizing the concept of "what is socialism" throughout the entire party and the country.
Our country has achieved a transition from new democracy to socialism. From the perspective of model selection, if we say that in the first three years after the establishment of New China, the mixed economy model of new democracy was similar to Lenin's "New Economic Policy" in his later years, then from the proposal of the general line for the transition period in 1953, the mixed economy of new democracy gradually became a planned economy, which was mainly based on and guided by the Stalin model. In our Eastern large country, it was inevitable and necessary to choose the Soviet model as a whole for socialism under the conditions at that time, and practice has proved that it was successful. However, this choice inevitably brought about some side effects. During the implementation of the general line for the transition period, the whole party extensively studied the theory and practice of Soviet industrialization and collectivization, which led people to establish an idea in their minds that socialism is synonymous with the Soviet model, and even thought that in the Cold War environment of the two major camps of socialism and capitalism, apart from the Soviet model, there was no other socialist path. This one-sided understanding had a considerable impact on the dogmatism that emerged in practice, and was one of the important reasons for accelerating the transition to socialism, pursuing a higher level of advanced public ownership, and weakening the role of commodity economy and market. The emergence of this situation was difficult to avoid under the historical conditions at that time, or it can be said to be a stage that could not be bypassed in the process of sinicization of Marxism. Later, Mao Zedong pointed out, "In the first eight years, we copied foreign experiences because we did not understand, had no experience at all, and didn't know what to do, so we had no choice but to mimic." "Almost everything was copied from the Soviet Union, and there was very little creativity of our own." "Lacking creativity, lacking the ability to be independent and self-reliant." It can be said that in the course of our country's transition to socialism and the beginning of socialist construction, our party's exploration of the socialist path started with imitating the Soviet model. In 1956, Mao Zedong said in a dialogue with foreign communist party delegations: "The direction is the same, the content is the same, it is the content of socialism, and the form of the nation." He didn't realize that even the "content of socialism" was not just limited to the Soviet model; the national characteristics should not only be reflected in the "form" but also in the "content".
However, overall, starting from 1953, the party, drawing lessons from the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, adopted the policy of simultaneously promoting socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. The party, both theoretically and practically, effectively solved the arduous task of gradually transitioning China, a large country with nearly one-fourth of the world's population and a backward economy and culture, to socialism. Important developments were made in some theoretical and practical issues of Marxism. As a result, China entered a new period of planned economic construction and comprehensive implementation of socialist transformation.
III. Innovations of Marxism during the process of transitioning to socialism.
In our country, the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry is the process of gradually transitioning from new democracy to socialism. In the process of formulating and implementing the general line of the transition period, the party's innovation in the Soviet model is important in the relatively safe resolution of the form of socialist transformation. This specific transition form is influenced by the traditional socialist model, as well as having local characteristics that are different from the Soviet model and formed based on the actual situation in China.
1. gradually leading individual agriculture and handicrafts onto the path of collectivization through mutual aid and cooperation
An important aspect of the general line of the transition period is to guide individual agricultural and handicraft workers onto the path of collectivization. Based on the basic principles of Marxism regarding agricultural cooperation, and based on the nature of private ownership of farmers and craftsmen, after the working class has seized state power, they cannot use violence to deprive them, but can only go through cooperativization, "through demonstrating and providing social assistance," "transforming their private production and ownership into collective production and ownership of cooperatives." After the victory of the October Revolution, based on the vision of Marxist classic writers and combined with the actual existence of small commodity economy of Russian peasants like an ocean, Lenin proposed in "On the Cooperative System" to transform agriculture through cooperatives using socialist principles, transforming the individual ownership of farmers into the collective ownership of labor masses through cooperative plans. He believed that cooperatives were the best form of combining individual and national interests on the premise that individual interests of farmers are subordinated to national interests. After Lenin's death, under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet people began the process of agricultural collectivization while affirming Lenin's cooperative plan. Shortly after the start of agricultural collectivization, Stalin proposed the establishment of collective farms, emphasizing the acceleration of their construction. As a result, a comprehensive movement of collectivization quickly began. As the speed of collectivization accelerated, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) determined that agricultural labor collectives with communal ownership of land and means of production would be the main form of collective farms, and a policy change from restricting the rich peasants to eliminating them. During the process of comprehensive collectivization, there were instances of violating the principle of voluntary participation and forcibly joining the collective farms through administrative orders, which severely damaged agricultural productivity. Although the Soviet Union's agricultural collectivization to some extent provided material security such as food and raw materials for industrialization, it seriously harmed the alliance between workers and peasants and resulted in long-term stagnation of agriculture. The theory of agricultural cooperativization in Marxism and the practice of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union have had an important influence on the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts in our country.
In rural areas of our country, mutual cooperation is the initial form of collective agriculture. Mutual cooperation in rural areas originated from the economic construction practice in revolutionary base areas and has a long history. Even during the revolutionary war, Mao Zedong and others successfully led mutual cooperation in agriculture, handicrafts, and other areas in the base areas, accumulating preliminary practical experience within a certain scope. Organizing individual agriculture and handicrafts gradually, implementing mutual cooperation, became the consistent ideology of the party. On the eve of the establishment of New China, Mao Zedong pointed out at the 7th Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee of the Party: "If we only have state-owned economy without cooperative economy, we will not be able to gradually guide the individual economy of the working people towards collectivization, we will not be able to develop from the New Democratic Society to the future socialist society, and we will not be able to consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the state power." In the spring of 1951, when there was a difference of opinion within the Party on whether mutual cooperation in the old liberated areas should be immediately elevated from mutual aid groups to cooperatives, Mao Zedong clearly supported the opinion of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. In September 1951, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperation" was established, which determined that on the basis of temporary seasonal mutual aid groups and year-round mutual aid groups, primary agricultural production cooperatives with land shares would be developed and gradually transitioned to advanced agricultural production cooperatives with public ownership of land, achieving the socialist transformation of agriculture. In this way, through temporary mutual aid groups, year-round mutual aid groups, development to primary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives, the transitional form of implementing collective agriculture has already been basically resolved in the practice of economic recovery.
After the overall line for the transitional period was proposed, Mao Zedong further proposed that agricultural mutual cooperation must go through three stages from lower to higher forms gradually based on summarizing the long-term experience of leading agricultural mutual cooperation. That is, calling on farmers to organize agricultural production mutual aid groups consisting of several households or a dozen households with certain socialist elements; on the basis of mutual aid groups, organizing small-scale primary agricultural production cooperatives with land shares and unified operation as characteristics, which have a semi-socialist nature; on the basis of primary cooperatives, organizing large-scale advanced agricultural production cooperatives with fully socialist nature. Mao Zedong believed that taking the method of gradually progressing from lower forms to higher forms has three advantages: it can gradually change the farmers' way of life, making them feel less sudden about the change in their way of life; it can basically avoid the decrease in crop production for a period of time; it can train cadres. Mao Zedong also emphasized that agricultural mutual cooperation must adhere to the principles of typical demonstration, voluntary mutual benefit, active leadership, and steady progress.
In December 1953, based on Mao Zedong's conversation on agricultural cooperation, the CPC Central Committee passed the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," proposing that agricultural socialist transformation should go through three steps: mutual aid groups, primary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives. It pointed out: "This development path from having sprouts of socialism, to having more socialist factors, to complete socialist cooperativization is the path pointed out by our party for gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture." According to the understanding at the time, adopting the form of agricultural mutual cooperation was not only an effective form to help farmers overcome difficulties and increase production but also an appropriate form to avoid polarization and develop towards socialism.
After the comprehensive start of the "First Five-Year Plan," in order to solve the prominent contradiction between the rapid expansion of construction scale and the tight supply and demand of grain, China also made a major decision, that is, to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products starting from the end of 1953. Unified purchase and sale are closely related to the mutual aid and cooperation movement, as the two strategic measures for the socialist transformation of the small peasant economy, fundamentally excluding and replacing the position of private wholesalers in important materials such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, weakening the connection between farmers and the market, strengthening the connection between state-owned economy and farmers, further promoting the majority of farmers to embark on the path of collectivization, and driving the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. By the end of 1956, agricultural collectivization was achieved ahead of schedule nationwide, and the socialist transformation of rural means of production was basically completed.
From an overall perspective, the goal model of agricultural collectivization mainly follows the comprehensive collectivization model of the Soviet Union, gradually transitioning to socialism through cooperation and collectivization. Due to the exaggeration of the counter-effects of production relations, it is believed that the improvement of the level of public ownership can always promote the development of productive forces and overcome the mentality of small private owners among farmers, and solve the perceived polarization in rural areas at that time. The Party emphasized more the advantages and strengths of collective management, while seriously lacking understanding of the initiative and vitality of farmers' individual or family operations, even viewing them as spontaneous tendencies towards capitalism. However, we should not overlook the efforts made by our Party in exploring specific approaches in combination with China's actual conditions. Due to the Party's understanding of the rural situation and its rich experience in mutual aid and cooperation practices, it has created a specific approach different from the comprehensive collectivization of the Soviet Union in the socialist transformation of agriculture. For example, following the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, typical demonstration, and state assistance, it created the transitional forms from temporary mutual aid groups and perennial mutual aid groups to semi-socialist primary cooperatives, and further developed to socialist advanced cooperatives. For the rich peasant economy, it did not adopt the practice of confiscation and expulsion of rich peasants, but instead implemented a policy of gradual elimination through restrictions, and so on. Of course, these practices are just different specific approaches to the transition to socialism. At this time, the Party's understanding of socialism is still basically based on the framework of the Soviet model from the Stalin era. Therefore, hidden contradictions are implied in the success of agricultural collectivization movement, leading to various twists and turns in the subsequent development of agriculture and rural areas.
The socialist transformation of individual handicraft industry is one of the three major transformation tasks proposed by the general line of the transitional period. The socialist transformation of individual handicraft industry, like the socialist transformation of agriculture, follows the path of collectivization, changing the personal ownership of handicraft laborers into collective ownership. It mainly adopts three forms: supply and marketing cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production cooperatives, gradually organizing a large number of scattered individual handicraft workers, and realizing socialist transformation from dispersion to concentration, from a lower level to a higher level.
2. After the peaceful redemption of the bourgeoisie through the realization of state capitalism
The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also an important aspect of the general line during the transitional period. Compared with the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicraft industry, the forms created by the party in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are more diverse, and the social achievements made in the sinicization of Marxism are more prominent. 
Marx and Engels believed that after the proletariat seizes political power, it must use its political rule to expropriate all the means of production owned by the capitalists, making them the property of the people of the socialist state. This can be done either by violent expropriation or by peaceful means. They believed that if the property of the bourgeoisie could be completely nationalized through redemption, it would be the cheapest way for the proletariat. Lenin, based on this idea, once envisioned seeking compromise and carrying out redemption with capitalists who were willing to accept state capitalism after the victory of the October Revolution in Russia, and he attempted this. However, it was not realized due to the resistance of the Russian bourgeoisie.
The party and Mao Zedong, while proposing the general line for the transitional period, creatively opened a path for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce based on the actual conditions in China. Based on the actual situation in China and the practice of cooperating with the national bourgeoisie during the democratic revolution, the party and the government summarized the experience of utilizing and restricting capitalist industry and commerce since the founding of New China. By adopting methods such as subcontracting, planned ordering, centralized purchasing and selling, commissioned distribution and sales, public-private partnership, and industry-wide public-private partnership, they effectively addressed the principles, policies, and steps for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. They particularly succeeded in redeeming the bourgeoisie.
In China, it is realistically possible to achieve the Marxist-Leninist idea of peacefully buying out the bourgeoisie. The Chinese national bourgeoisie had a dual nature not only during the democratic revolution but also during the socialist period. During the process of socialist revolution, the Chinese national bourgeoisie had both the side of exploiting the working class for profits and the side of supporting the constitution and willing to accept socialist transformation. Due to the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, the people gained control of a powerful state apparatus, the socialist state-owned economy grasped the lifeline of the country's economy, the agricultural cooperativization movement was advancing, and the alliance between workers and peasants continued to be consolidated. Under these circumstances, the national bourgeoisie had no choice but to accept transformation.
The adoption of different forms of state capitalism to peacefully buy out private capitalism is a prominent achievement of the party's localization of Marxism. Before 1953, the primary form of state capitalism, mainly through subcontracting and centralized purchasing and selling, had already seen significant development in the private industry during the process of restoring the national economy. After proposing the general line for the transitional period, the party entered a new stage of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Through investigation and research, the party and the government determined the active and steady approach of bringing private factories that met the transformation conditions and were needed by the state into the track of public-private partnership. When conditions were ripe, these public-private partnership enterprises would be transformed into socialist enterprises. In this way, the transformation of private industry and commerce through state capitalism, and the planned and steady development of primary form state capitalism towards advanced form state capitalism, became the main guideline for advancing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. As Mao Zedong pointed out in 1953, state capitalism is "capitalism managed under the people's government, in various forms and linked with the state-owned socialist economy, and supervised by workers." "Its main purpose is not for the capitalists' profit but for supplying the needs of the people and the state." "This new form of state capitalism has a significant socialist nature and is beneficial to the workers and the state." In September of the same year, Mao Zedong made it clear during a conversation with representatives from democratic parties and the industrial and commercial circles that "state capitalism is the necessary path for transforming capitalist industry and commerce and gradually completing the socialist transition."
In the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the Party and the government took into account the legitimate profits that capitalists should receive and adopted the approach of redeeming their means of production. On September 7, 1953, when Mao Zedong spoke with representatives from democratic parties and the industrial and commercial sectors, he put forward the famous "Four Horsemen Share the Wealth" principle. According to this principle, while the working class produced for the country, they also had to produce a portion of profits for the capitalists, which were used to redeem the bourgeoisie. Due to the adoption of a comprehensive set of peaceful transformation guidelines and policies, coupled with the beneficial cooperation of progressive elements within the national bourgeoisie, democratic parties, and industrial and commercial associations during the socialist transformation process, our country successfully realized the peaceful redemption of the bourgeoisie envisioned by Marx and Lenin. In the transformation of the entire capitalist private ownership, not only was productivity not destroyed, but it also developed. In 1955, the labor productivity of state-private joint venture industrial enterprises was about twice as high as that of private industrial enterprises.
In the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the Party and the government also combined the transformation of capitalist private ownership with the transformation of capitalists, adopting the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the national bourgeoisie. While transforming the capitalists, they were given necessary work arrangements, their political rights were not deprived, and they were given the right to vote. Suitable political arrangements were made for representatives who made contributions during the transformation. Through the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, by 1956, the capitalists had been separated from the original means of production and were no longer exploiters or rulers, but rather employees serving socialism under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the workers. Although capitalists still received a five percent interest rate, it was no longer linked to the original business profits. For the majority of people, this was no longer their main source of income. The majority of them changed their class position as exploiters and became workers or state cadres who supported the Party's leadership and the socialist system. This was a great victory for the Party and the government's policy of peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie.
In the process of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the Party and the government creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to China's actual conditions and successfully opened up a path to transform capitalism. This was manifested in three aspects: Firstly, a series of transitional forms, from lower to higher levels, such as subcontracting, planned ordering, centralized purchasing and marketing, entrusted distribution, state-private joint ventures, and industry-wide state-private joint ventures, were gradually and not suddenly used to change the bourgeoisie's ownership. Secondly, the bourgeoisie was redeemed through state capitalism by paying for their assets, using peaceful means rather than violent confiscation, transforming national capitalist enterprises into state capitalism and achieving successful redemption of the bourgeoisie. Thirdly, the political alliance with the national bourgeoisie was maintained, treating the bourgeoisie as an internal contradiction of the people, adopting a policy of both unity and struggle to eliminate the national bourgeoisie and gradually transform the majority of this class into workers. After the socialist transformation, the united front in our country continued to be consolidated and developed, the national bourgeoisie and various democratic parties entered socialist society together with other laborers, and contributed to the construction of socialism. These experiences of peacefully transforming capitalist enterprises, which emerged from China's specific conditions, enriched and developed the scientific socialist theory of Marxism.
One crucial reason why our country has been able to successfully develop a path that aligns with China's reality in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the deep understanding of the Chinese national conditions and an accurate grasp of the characteristics of the national bourgeoisie by the Communist Party. During the practice of the new democratic revolution and the establishment of New China, the Communist Party had a long history of cooperation with the national bourgeoisie and has always given a fair evaluation of their unique status and significant influence in Chinese history, distinguishing them from the bourgeoisie in other countries. Even after the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie became the principal contradiction in society and struggles of restriction and counter-restriction were launched, the Party still maintained a clear understanding that the national bourgeoisie possessed modern cultural and modern enterprise management knowledge, "regardless of the past or the present, this class has a great influence and role in our society". Based on this understanding, combined with the Party's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, as well as every step taken according to these policies, all "have studied the actual situation from various aspects and have been formulated to address the urgent needs of the country and the people". Therefore, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce "not only received the support of the broad masses, but the capitalists also could not find any solid reason to refuse or oppose it". Here, the study of "the actual situation from various aspects" and "addressing the urgent needs of the country and the people" is obviously an important link in adapting Marxism to China and successfully guiding the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
In summary, although the target model to be achieved during the transition and the speed at which it was rapidly achieved were mainly based on the Soviet model, in terms of the specific methods and approaches of socialist transformation, we have our own creative approach that aligns with China's national conditions.
However, the central government soon realized the limitations of the Soviet model and began to explore China's own path of development. Mao Zedong's work, "On the Ten Major Relationships," in 1956, was a landmark publication that signaled the Party's exploration of a Chinese-style socialist construction path and laid the groundwork for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Around the time of the Party's Eighth National Congress in 1956, based on the basic principles of Marxism and China's reality, the Party put forward a series of important and correct (or relatively correct) principles and policies on major issues such as the primary contradiction in socialist society, China's industrialization path, the proportional relationship between various sectors of socialist modernization construction, the speed of construction, the Party's policies towards intellectuals, the Party's ethnic policies and united front policies, the guidelines for developing science and culture, promoting socialist democracy, and economic system reforms. In his "Ten-Year Summary" in 1960, Mao Zedong said, "In the first eight years, we copied foreign experiences. Starting from the proposal of the Ten Major Relationships in 1956, we began to find our own path that suits China, and started reflecting the objective economic laws of China." However, mainly due to the limitations of the time, this reform did not touch the core of the traditional Soviet model, but rather consisted mostly of modifications within the system.
Practice has proven that taking socialist public ownership as the sole economic foundation of socialist society and regarding a single socialist economic structure as the only correct path that our country should take, thereby excluding the existence of various forms of ownership, is not in line with the extremely backward basic national conditions of the Chinese economy. Although the formation of the single planned economic model in China in the later stage of socialist transformation had historical and practical reasons and played an important positive role, from the subsequent development, this model and experience should not be absolutized. The rashness in the late 1950s during the Great Leap Forward and the collectivization movement actually had its roots in the embryonic state that existed in the three major transformations. The historical experience of socialist transformation in China has shown that the great practice of combining the basic principles of Marxism with the Chinese reality requires the unremitting exploration and efforts of the communists, especially gaining a clear understanding in dealing scientifically with general principles and accurately grasping the special national conditions.
Although the Party's understanding of socialism was still immature in the mid-1950s, and there were some shortcomings and deviations in the socialist transformation, looking at the overall picture of China's economic and social development in the 1950s, as well as the international context of the confrontation between socialism and capitalism, and the Cold War, it was inevitable and completely correct for the Party to lead hundreds of millions of people in choosing the socialist path.
3. The Initial Stage of Socialist Industrialization.
During the socialist transformation, China implemented its first five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1953 to 1957. The plan stipulated that the economic construction tasks should mainly rely on our own efforts, supplemented by support from the Soviet Union and other friendly countries, and significant achievements were made by the end of 1957. The progress of basic construction went smoothly, and a large number of important engineering projects were completed. Some industrial sectors that were necessary for the country's industrialization but previously nonexistent were built from scratch, enhancing the strength of basic industries. The industrial technology foundation was strengthened, and the level of production significantly improved. From 1953 to 1956, the economy developed rapidly with good results, and the proportions between important economic sectors were relatively harmonious. The market prospered, and prices remained stable. People's living standards improved significantly. Cultural, education, scientific, and health undertakings also experienced significant development. The completion and great achievements of the first five-year plan played an important role in the initial stage of China's industrialization, laying a preliminary foundation for the realization of socialist industrialization.
In the process of implementing the "First Five-Year Plan," although China paid attention to learning from the Soviet Union's experience in construction, it also took into account its own reality and implemented the consistent principle of integrating the universal principles of Marxism with China's construction practice, enriching and developing the scientific socialist theory of Marxism. This is manifested in the following aspects: Firstly, the major focus was on developing heavy industry, but heavy industry was not developed in isolation; instead, overall arrangements and comprehensive balancing were made among various sectors to achieve planned and proportionate coordination of national economic development. Secondly, the plan emphasized the scale and speed of economic construction, which must be based on actual conditions and make correct estimates of the possibility of growth in our subjective and objective forces. Thirdly, the policy of self-reliance as the mainstay and seeking support from foreign countries as an auxiliary was implemented. During the "First Five-Year Plan" period, China received significant assistance from the Soviet government. However, China still insisted on self-reliance as the main principle and would not rely on foreign aid for matters that it could solve on its own. In 1956, the Central Committee further clarified the policy of establishing an independent and complete industrial system. This had profound significance for China's subsequent adherence to an independent and autonomous position in the face of drastic changes in international relations. Fourthly, the party demanded correct handling of the relationship between accumulation and consumption in planned economic construction, appropriately combining the development of production with the improvement of people's living standards.
Under the leadership of the first generation of the Central Leadership Collective with Mao Zedong as the core, the establishment of New China and the establishment of the basic socialist system were important achievements of the sinicization of Marxism. It was a tremendous historical change realized by Chinese society in the 20th century. In this historic change, due to the influence of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and the level of understanding of socialism worldwide at the time, the sinicization of Marxism in this stage was realized through the mediation of the Soviet model of the Stalin era, combined with China's own conditions. Therefore, the socialist model formed after the completion of the three major transformations in China clearly had the characteristics of the Soviet model. This was unavoidable at the time. The socialist transformation left behind many problems, which can be attributed to the hasty and rough work resulting in deviations. However, fundamentally, it was the influence of the Soviet model. The Party Central Committee soon discovered these problems and began to adjust and reform this model formed by the socialist transformation, aiming to explore a path of building socialism in China through practice.

Chapter 5 The Good Beginning of the "Second Leap" of Sinicizing Marxism
It was only after more than ten or even several decades that people began to see more and more clearly that 1956 was a turning point of great significance for both Chinese communists and the international communist movement. The significance of this turning point was manifested in the fact that two major changes occurred simultaneously in the same year, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, socialist countries embarked on the reform of the Stalinist model, and socialism faced a profound transformation from tradition to modernity. For socialist countries at this time, the main issue was no longer whether to reform, but how to reform. Domestically, in 1956, with the completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production as a symbol, the basic socialist system was initially established in China, and China entered the primary stage of socialism. The main task of the Communist Party of China was to shift from revolution to comprehensive construction and to reform the Soviet model that was blindly copied, thus exploring China's own path to building socialism. The overlap and intersection of these two tasks not only provided rare opportunities for our construction and reform, but also greatly increased the difficulty of choosing the model. For example, the method, approach, and standards for establishing a socialist society in China, as well as the socialist system established based on them, were essentially copied from the Stalinist model. In other words, the socialism we had just established in 1956 was already a socialism that needed various reforms. However, compared with countries like the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that were also undergoing reforms, this model had been present in our country for a relatively short time and its shortcomings were not fully revealed. This undoubtedly increased the difficulty of understanding.
The starting point of China's socialist construction is far lower than the initial vision of socialism by the founder of Marxism, and also lower than that of countries like the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In such a country, there is no ready-made answer in the textbook of Marxism, and there is no successful experience to learn from in the world socialist movement. China once took the Stalinist model as a learning example, but the dazzling halo of this model gradually dimmed in the reform era that began in 1956. With reduced pressure and restrictions, the old dogmatism lost its effect, and the space for exploration increased. Where will the road to Chinese socialism go? How will China's reform proceed? The first generation of party leaders, represented by Mao Zedong, is full of enthusiasm, with liberated thinking and determination to continue creatively developing Marxism on the basis of the first leap of making Marxism Chinese and achieve the second leap of making Marxism Chinese.
I. What is socialism?
1. The socialist thought and practice of classical Marxist writers
Socialism, as a ideology, theory, ideal, and belief, as well as a practice and movement, has had a profound and far-reaching impact on human society. It reflects the human longing and pursuit for an ideal future society and has sparked numerous social movements of various sizes since modern times. Over the past century, several generations of Marxist classic writers have put forward various ideas and plans for socialism, which have both inherited and differed from one another, and have both universality and particularity. Under the guidance and influence of these thoughts, Marxists and left-wing leaders in different eras and countries have proposed various ideas and plans. These plans vary in different Eastern and Western countries, in less developed and advanced countries, in countries with different historical and cultural traditions, and in different historical contexts, making it difficult to have a common and standard summary of them. Faced with the history of scientific socialism for more than a century, the only precise answer that can be given is that it is a social movement that adapts to the development of productive forces, conforms to the laws of social development, continuously improves the living conditions of humanity, and strives for social fairness and justice. This complex and rich history and reality of socialism have profoundly influenced the socialist ideology of the Communist Party of China and its expectations and designs for the socialist system. 
In the 19th century, the materialist conception of history and the theory of surplus value established by Marx and Engels placed the long-standing socialist ideology "on a realistic basis" and established the theory of scientific socialism. They believed that in the process of realizing socialism and communism, no matter how much theory and idealism, agitation and propaganda, armed struggle and self-sacrifice are needed, it is a "natural historical process" that must be based on a level of productive forces higher than capitalism. The implementation of socialism inevitably requires proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. After the socialist society is established, it also needs to go through a process of development from immaturity to maturity and will present certain stages due to differences in the level of economic and social development. Its manifestation in different countries, different times, and different ethnic groups will exhibit different characteristics. The future society, with highly developed productive forces as the material basis, will have the means of production owned by the whole society, and the principle of distribution will be based on labor or even needs. Social production will be planned and organized, the state will gradually wither away, and members of society will enjoy free and comprehensive development, and so on.
In addition, Marx also attached great importance to the exploration of the development path of Eastern societies, proposing that under certain conditions, Eastern societies can leap over the "Kafu Ding Valley" of capitalist system and directly enter socialist society. He also emphasized the need for socialism to absorb "all the positive achievements created by the capitalist system" and other valuable ideas. In his later years, Engels connected the new characteristics of capitalist development with the future society, and proposed that the development of capitalism prepares more sufficient material conditions for socialism, and the strategy of proletarian revolutionary struggle should change with the change of historical conditions.
During and after the October Revolution, Lenin once envisioned relying on the power of the Soviet state to suppress the resistance of capitalists and landlords, confiscate their means of production for the benefit of the workers' state, expand people's democracy, and quickly transition from the period of proletarian dictatorship to a socialist society. However, as practice unfolded, Lenin realized that in Russia, which had a majority of small peasants and a vast influence of the petite bourgeoisie, the path towards socialism would inevitably be a long and difficult process. Russia would remain in a transitional period from capitalism to socialism for a long time. Therefore, after seizing power, Lenin shifted his focus from the intensification of class struggle during the revolutionary period to observing problems more from the perspective of the development of productive forces. He directly linked the destiny of socialism to the level of development of productive forces. He emphasized multiple times that after the proletariat seized power in Russia, the work must quickly shift to economic construction, and the socialist material foundation must be established as soon as possible. It was necessary to learn from and utilize the achievements of capitalist civilization, implement state capitalism controlled and guided by the working class as an intermediate link to transition to socialism. He also recognized that some aspects of the envisioned future "socialist society" often remained abstract and could only become reality through a series of various imperfect specific attempts to establish socialist states. The differences between the socialist reality in Russia and the socialism envisioned by Marx and Engels deeply made Lenin aware that the era of debating socialism based solely on books had passed, and from now on, everything had to be evaluated based on practice. The methodological significance of Lenin's ideas lies in the fact that theory is necessary, but socialism in practice holds a more fundamental significance. Theory must develop alongside practice and be tested by practice. Marxism must constantly be nationalized and adapted to the times, and this can only be realized through practice. This kind of socialist perspective is an extremely valuable spiritual wealth left by Lenin for future generations. However, for quite a long period of time, Lenin's successors and students failed to fully understand his intentions.
The international imperialist offensive in 1918 and the rebellion of the counter-revolutionary White Army disrupted Lenin and the Bolshevik Party's pace of socialist construction and transformation, and also led to certain changes in his understanding of socialism. To meet the needs of the war, the country began implementing a policy of "war communism". Although this policy played a significant role in supporting the war, it quickly sparked nationwide resistance and riots because it went beyond the practical historical stage. The convening of the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) in spring 1921 marked a historic turn from war communism to the new economic policy. The two works, "Report on Replacing the Surplus Grain Collection System with a Physical Tax" and "On Grain Tax," reflect Lenin's ideological transformation in the early stages of implementing the new economic policy. Based on practical considerations, he allowed for the free circulation and trade of grain, and pointed out that this had positive significance for realizing the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, rural-urban exchange, and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants. In the most important works of Lenin's later years, such as "On Cooperation," "On the Russian Revolution," and "Better Fewer, But Better," his socialist views received significant developments. He began to break through the traditional thinking that socialism must eliminate commodity money relations, and that social production should be controlled by the state plan, and regarded free trade as capitalism. For the first time, he incorporated the principle of a market economy into the scope of socialism, achieving an important leap in the understanding of socialism. Lenin fully affirmed that backward Russia could create and develop modern civilization and realize a socialist society through different paths from Western European countries; the Bolshevik Party needed to create the material foundation required for the development of socialism on the basis of the necessary political prerequisites. Lenin's socialist thoughts in his later years, based on the new developments and situations of Russian socialist practice, combined revolutionary and flexible exploration spirit, presenting Russian characteristics and grandeur in socialist theory and practice, enriching and developing the socialist thoughts of Marx and Engels.
After Lenin's death, during the leadership of the Soviet Union's socialist revolution and construction process, Stalin gradually formed his own socialist construction theories. He adhered to the theory of building socialism in one country and advocated prioritizing the development of heavy industry, understanding socialist industrialization as the industrialization of heavy industry. For agriculture, he implemented comprehensive collectivization, demanding a quick change in the form of ownership of the entire rural means of production, a rapid leap to socialism to ensure the supply of grain and industrial raw materials needed by the country. He also put forward the argument that class struggle is becoming increasingly sharp, believing that all achievements in socialist construction are the result of class struggle. He changed Lenin's thinking and path of the New Economic Policy, and after defeating the opposition within the party, he launched a movement for accelerated industrialization and comprehensive agricultural collectivization, and carried out a large-scale purge internally and externally, basically forming the "Stalinist model" in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the absence of experience, with powerful enemies lurking, with the development speed being of decisive significance, it was necessary to rely on strong administrative power rather than economic leverage to drive rapid economic development, and also considering the influence of various factors such as Russian traditional culture, this model adapted to the needs of rapid development in several key aspects, meeting the internal requirements of the Soviet social development, and laying the foundation for consolidating and developing the first socialist country and achieving the great victory in the Patriotic War. However, this model's highly centralized aspects in politics, economy, and culture, its restrictions on commodity economy and promotion of hierarchical bureaucratic systems and personality cults, as well as its "left" doctrinal tendencies in socialist views, promotion of chauvinism in foreign relations, and so on, brought serious consequences to the Soviet socialist construction and the entire international communist movement.
2. The rise of the wave of socialist reform.
After World War II, socialism went beyond the scope of one country and formed the socialist camp. As the first socialist country, the Soviet Union's historical legitimacy, its great achievements in economic construction in the 1920s and 1930s, its superpower status, and the need for international political struggle, made socialist countries follow the Soviet Union's development model. However, at the same time, communist and workers' parties in various countries also showed a strong desire to follow a national path and expressed their demands for reforming certain shortcomings of the Soviet model. There was a gradual tendency towards the localization of Marxism. Even in the Soviet Union, considering its own historical experience and the new situation after the war, limited revisions to the existing model began. Stalin's 1952 work "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," although it did not break through the overall traditional socialist model, made certain revisions to the understanding of commodity production, the law of value under socialist conditions, and the contradictions in socialist social relations and productive forces. It developed the theory of scientific socialism to a certain extent and promoted the modernization of Marxism. After Stalin's death in 1953, the new leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, based on continuous reflection on the gains and losses of the existing model, could accelerate the pace and intensify the reforms of the Stalinist model, and propose some reform measures with a "thawing" color. The initial reforms opened the door for the Soviet Union and contemporary socialist reforms. Starting from the early 1950s, other socialist countries also made certain adjustments to aspects of the Soviet model according to their own national conditions.
The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party held in February 1956 has a very important historical significance in the history of socialist reforms. The exposure and criticism of Stalin's personality cult and its serious consequences at the Congress, although it brought some negative consequences, but more importantly, it brought a new atmosphere of ideological liberation, independent thinking, and breaking dogmatism. It provided a new opportunity to break through the Stalinist model. It made it possible for communist parties and Marxists in various countries to re-study Marxism and the new situation and problems faced by the contemporary proletarian revolution, and to independently formulate lines, policies, and guidelines that are suitable for their own national conditions and have their own characteristics. The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party adapted to the tide of reforms in socialist countries at that time, and promoted the process of nationalization and modernization of Marxism, thereby pushing Marxism and the international communist movement into a new stage of development, although its one-sidedness is clearly evident. One more thing needs to be noted here. That is, after Stalin's death, the leading role of the Soviet Communist Party had already begun to reform the Stalinist model to a certain extent, and this reform trend intensified after 1956. Therefore, it is inappropriate to generally refer to the Soviet model since 1953, because it denies the reforms made by Stalin's successors and denies the two "Soviet models" that emerged after 1953, although these two models have many similarities.
From a direct perspective, the propositions and practices of socialist reforms in the 1950s were based on new historical conditions and the actual conditions of various countries, attempting to break through the Stalinist socialist model and answer the questions of "what is socialism" and "how to build socialism" under the new historical conditions. From a deeper level, it also includes the development of Marxism based on the changing era characteristics and specific national conditions of various countries, which is to promote the modernization of Marxism. This is not only a matter of breaking through the Stalinist model but also breaking through some important concepts of traditional socialist theory. Because without breaking through some traditional socialist ideas, it is also impossible to break through the Soviet model. In this sense, the era of socialist reform is also the era of the modernization of Marxism. The 1950s was an important turning point for the modernization of Marxism, and communist regimes around the world bore the arduous task of advancing the modernization of Marxism based on new historical conditions and their own realities.
II. Emancipate the mind and take our own path
1. Abolish superstition and oppose dogmatism
The Chinese Communist Party has been deeply influenced by the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. To a large extent, the Party's understanding and acceptance of the basic principles of Marxism were mainly achieved through the intermediary and bridge of the Soviet Communist Party during the Stalin era. As mentioned earlier, shortly after the founding of New China, due to the constraints of ideology and the international situation, as well as the urgent need to revive the national economy, and because the Soviet model itself was more in line with the requirements of the initial stage of industrialization in backward countries with extensive development, and also because of the adherence to the Soviet socialist model at that time, the Chinese Communist Party gradually corrected and abandoned certain ideas and plans for a new democratic society, as expressed in "On New Democracy," "On the United Front," and "The Common Program," and comprehensively learned and introduced the Soviet model in politics, economy, culture, and military. At that time, this had a certain historical inevitability and played an important role in the rapid construction of a strong industrial, national defense, and scientific foundation in our country.
With the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, the socialist economic system characterized by public ownership of the means of production and distribution according to work has been established, and the socialist basic political system characterized by the system of the People's Congress has been established. At the same time, the shortcomings of the planned economic system with a strong Soviet imprint began to gradually emerge, and the newly established planned economic system actually faced adjustment and reform. During the period from 1953 to 1956, in the process of comprehensive learning and introduction of the Soviet model, Mao Zedong, who was known for his opposition to dogmatism during the democratic revolution, was not unaware of the shortcomings of this model. He even felt "suppressed" because of it and criticized the phenomenon of blindly copying the Soviet model.
Just at this time, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union unveiled the cover of Stalin, punctured the sacred halo of the Stalinist socialist model, and dispelled the long-standing superstition about the Soviet experience. At that time, the leaders of the Communist Party of China were filled with a sense of liberation. Mao Zedong affirmed Khrushchev's criticism of Stalin many times, saying that it "broke the deification, unveiled the cover, which is a kind of liberation, a 'liberation war', everyone dares to speak and think about issues". He also said that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union showed that "the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Stalin are not all correct, which dispels superstition" and "is conducive to opposing dogmatism." He believed that socialist construction did not have to completely follow the Soviet formula, but could propose policies and guidelines suitable for the specific conditions of the country. "Successful experiences are successful in one country, but if they are blindly copied without considering the specific conditions of another country, it will lead to failure," he said. "This is an important international experience." He further pointed out that the occurrence of the Hungarian and Polish events was the result of blindly copying the Soviet model, which indicated that the ruling parties in various countries faced the problem of how to combine the universal truth of the October Revolution with the actual conditions of their own countries. For our party, we should no longer think that everything done in the Soviet Union is absolute truth, but should better consider China's own problems. At the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he proposed: "China and the Soviet Union are both socialist countries, are there any differences? Yes, there are." After listing many differences between the two countries, he criticized some comrades: "They don't speak dialectics, don't analyze... they look at problems one-sidedly, thinking that everything in the Soviet Union is good, and they have copied a lot of things that should not be copied. Those things that were copied wrongly and are not suitable for our land must be rectified."
At the same time, other members of the central leadership collective also put forward similar thoughts. Liu Shaoqi said: "Regarding some issues of socialism, we have new experiences. We need to emphasize summarizing our own experiences and solving our own problems with our own experiences, instead of blindly copying others. Those who can think independently will not stumble, while those who copy blindly will make mistakes. Many experiences of the Soviet Union are still worth studying." He also strongly criticized the dogmatism phenomenon in the field of education that emerged from studying the Soviet Union. During the Eighth Party Congress, Zhou Enlai said during a meeting with foreign party delegations: "In the past, Stalin's views dominated everything. Now, after overthrowing the idol, or what the Chinese people call breaking superstitions, 'the thinking of communist parties in various countries has started to move and is no longer dull.' Personal worship has been overthrown, 'everyone's thoughts have also been liberated, which is a great progress for communist parties in various countries. This is the ideological liberation of the Communist Party'." He also reminded the whole party that while studying the Soviet Union's experiences, they must "think independently, avoid blindly following, and not be superstitious." Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the specific realities of our own country is itself a universal truth. It involves two aspects: one is the universal truth, and the other is the combination with the specific realities of our own country. We have always believed that giving up either one is not acceptable," "We must study the characteristics of our own country. If we abandon our own characteristics and blindly copy foreign things, this universal truth cannot be realized." At the end of 1956, an article entitled "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" was published in the People's Daily, continuing the criticism of dogmatism in the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat". It clearly pointed out: "All the experiences of the Soviet Union, including the basic experiences, are combined with certain national characteristics and should not be copied as they are by other countries." The idea of "walking our own path" resonated widely within and outside the party, becoming the consensus of the whole country and the entire party.
2. The Proposal of the "Second Combination" Task
On April 5, 1956, the People's Daily published an editorial article entitled "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" after being reviewed and revised by Mao Zedong and discussed and passed by the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau. It clearly pointed out that the historical viewpoint should be applied to evaluate Stalin and that beneficial lessons should be drawn from his mistakes. During the discussion of this article by the Central Political Bureau, Mao Zedong pointed out: The key question for the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is what benefits we can derive from it. The most important thing is to combine the basic principles of Marxism with the specific realities of the Chinese revolution and construction. During the period of the democratic revolution, we achieved this combination successfully only after suffering great losses and won the victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Now it is the period of socialist revolution and construction, and we need to make the second combination and find out how to build socialism in China. I started thinking about this issue several years ago. Now, thanks to Khrushchev’s revelations, we should consider how to do things according to China's circumstances and not be superstitious like we did in the past. In fact, in the past, we were not completely superstitious; we had our own originality. Now we must work harder to find the specific path for building socialism in China. Here, Mao Zedong put forward a historically significant task to the whole party, which is to achieve the "second combination" of Marxism and the specific realities of China during the period of building socialism on the basis of successfully realizing the "first combination" of Marxism and China's actual conditions during the period of the new democratic revolution. The "second combination" includes two fundamental meanings: first, it affirms that under the conditions of socialist history, Chinese Communists must still adhere to the correct direction of combining Marxism with China's actual conditions; second, it points out that in order to adapt to new situations and tasks, we can no longer be satisfied with the achievements of the first combination. Instead, we must, based on past foundations and according to new historical conditions, realize a new and greater combination.
The speech "On the Ten Major Relationships" by Mao Zedong in April 1956 marked the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party's exploration of its own path to socialist construction in China. "On the Ten Major Relationships" was summarized by Mao Zedong based on extensive and in-depth investigations and studies conducted by the first generation of Party leaders represented by him, through multiple discussions by the central leadership collective. It is the crystallization of the wisdom of the central leadership collective. This report established a basic policy and the fundamental guiding ideology for socialist construction, which is to "strive to turn negative factors into positive factors" and "make every effort to mobilize all positive factors, both direct and indirect, within the Party and outside the Party, domestically and internationally, to build our country into a powerful socialist state." The ten major issues (or ten major relationships) discussed in the report were proposed on the one hand by summarizing the experiences and studying the problems of China's construction and development, and on the other hand by drawing lessons from the Soviet experience. The report began by sharply pointing out, "It is worth noting that recently the Soviet side has exposed some shortcomings and mistakes in the process of constructing socialism, the detours they have taken. Do you still want to follow in their footsteps? In the past, it was precisely because of their lessons learned that we took fewer detours. Now, of course, we must be even more vigilant." "What we need to learn is what belongs to the universal truths and combine this with the concrete practice of China's revolution. If every sentence, including those of Marx, is to be mechanically followed, then that would be terrible. Our theory is a combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution." This clearly established the fundamental guiding ideology that socialist construction must be based on the country's own conditions and walk its own path, emphasizing the importance of basing it on the national conditions for socialist construction, thus dispelling the long-held superstition about the Soviet experience, in essence denying the singularity of the Soviet model, emphasizing the diverse orientation of socialist construction in different countries, and forming a distinct ideology of "walking our own path."
As mentioned earlier, around 1956, China actually faced two fundamental turning points: first, the shift from establishing a socialist system to initiating comprehensive socialist construction, namely, the shift of the focus of work; and second, the shift from the traditional Stalinist model to the contemporary socialist reform model, exploring a path of socialist construction that is different from the Soviet model and suitable for China's national conditions. These two turning points occurred simultaneously and interacted with each other. On the one hand, they provided favorable conditions for the "second combination," but on the other hand, they also increased the difficulty of combination. This particularly requires opposition to dogmatism and empiricism, and requires the Party to develop Marxism while adhering to the basic principles of Marxism, and to promote the sinicization of Marxism under new historical conditions.
The proposal of the task of the "second combination" indicates that sinicization of Marxism is not a task that can be completed all at once, but a process of continuous development. It is not a one-time success or correctness that can be achieved once and for all, but a journey full of twists and hardships. It also proves once again that the Chinese communists timely proposed and emphasized this great historical task with historical foresight.
III. The New Concept of the Socialist Construction Road at the Beginning of the "Second Combination"
From 1956 to the first half of 1957, under the guidance of the combination of Marxism and the realities of China, the Central Committee of the party put forward many new guidelines and ideas with a spirit of creativity and pioneering in various aspects such as the economy, politics, and culture. These promoted the historical process of sinicizing Marxism in the new historical conditions.
1. A Correct Understanding of the Principal Contradiction in Socialist Society
With the early completion of socialist transformation, Mao Zedong and other central leaders began to pay more attention to and study the main tasks and main contradictions of socialist society. In the Party's National Congress held in August 1955, Mao Zedong raised the issue of shifting the focus of the Party's work. He said: "We have entered a stage where what we are engaged in, thinking about, and studying is the socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation, the modernization of national defense, and starting to explore the new era of atomic energy." Based on a correct understanding of the significant changes that have taken place since the establishment of New China, the Eighth Party Congress clearly defined the transformation of the main domestic contradictions after the completion of socialist transformation and determined the strategic goal of socialist construction.
The political report and resolutions of the Eighth Party Congress pointed out that after the decisive victory of socialist transformation, the main contradiction within the country had shifted to one between the people's demand for building an advanced industrial country and the reality of being a backward agricultural country, and between the people's needs for rapid economic and cultural development and the current situation of not being able to meet those needs. The essence of this contradiction lies in the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. This conclusion is not only a correct summary of China's political situation but also a new understanding of China's national conditions. It serves as the basis for the Party to establish its correct line after the establishment of the socialist system in our country. The wording of the report regarding the essence of China's main domestic contradiction is not completely accurate in theory because it does not fully indicate that the socialist relations of production have already been established and are in line with the development of productive forces. At the same time, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfections are contradictory to the development of productive forces. However, the emphasis of this wording is on highlighting the fact that our country's productive forces are still lagging behind, emphasizing that under the socialist transformation of private ownership of the means of production, which has been basically completed, the country's main task is to protect and develop productive forces under the new production relations. The whole Party must concentrate its efforts on developing productive forces, so that our country can quickly transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. This is the most important theoretical contribution of the Eighth Party Congress and the foundation and core of the Eighth Party Congress' line. It also became the consensus of the entire Party at that time. Although Mao Zedong had some disagreements with this formulation at the time, he agreed with the main contradiction. Soon after, he expressed this idea again in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." He said, "Our fundamental task has changed from liberating productive forces to protecting and developing productive forces under the new production relations;" we must "unite the people of all nationalities in the country to engage in a new war - a war against nature, developing our economy, and developing our culture;" "consolidate our new system and build our new country."
2. Transcending the Soviet model in terms of economic development model.
According to the correct judgment of the principal contradiction in socialist society, the 8th National Congress established the strategic goals and visions of socialist construction in two stages: the first step is to complete primary industrialization within three five-year plans, and the second step is to approach or catch up with the most developed capitalist countries in the world within several decades. The new party constitution of the 8th National Congress pointed out that the party's task is to develop the national economy in a planned manner, to achieve national industrialization as quickly as possible, and to carry out technical transformation of the national economy in a systematic and step-by-step manner, "making China have a strong modern industry, modern agriculture, modern transportation industry, and modern defense."
Adhering to the economic construction policy of steadily advancing in a comprehensive balance while opposing conservatism and impetuosity. Even before the 8th National Congress, when opposing impetuous tendencies in economic construction in 1956, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and others pointed out that the development of production and the development of all other undertakings must be based on a stable and reliable foundation, and while opposing conservatism, the tendency of impetuosity must also be opposed. Guided by Mao Zedong's spirit of "On the Ten Major Relationships," the 8th National Congress continued to adhere to the economic construction policy of opposing conservatism and impetuosity, and steadily advancing in a comprehensive balance. In his report to the congress, Zhou Enlai emphasized combining the construction of key areas with overall planning, so that all sectors of the national economy can develop in proportion; increasing reserve forces, improving the material reserve system, and correctly handling the relationship between the economy and finance. These incisive summaries reflect the party's correct understanding and cautious attitude towards the laws of economic development at the beginning of the comprehensive development of socialist construction. The 2nd Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party adopted Zhou Enlai's proposed policy of "guaranteeing the key, appropriate contraction" in 1957 and correctly formulated the 1957 construction plan, thus ensuring that the economic work of that year became one of the best years since the founding of New China. The proposal of such a socialist economic construction policy is not simply a repetition of the experience of the "first five-year plan" period in our country and other countries, but a strategic decision made under the guidance of Marxism, combined with China's national conditions and economic situation.
Introduced the idea of industrialization with Chinese characteristics. In response to the one-sided emphasis on the development of heavy industry and the serious neglect of agriculture and light industry in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries and their adverse effects on our country, Mao Zedong pointed out that the development of agriculture and light industry "will make heavy industry develop more and faster, and because it guarantees the needs of people's livelihood, it will make its development more solid." The 8th National Congress further confirmed this policy. In 1957, Mao Zedong explicitly raised the issue of the industrialization path of China in his article titled "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People". He pointed out that the issue of the industrialization path mainly refers to the relationship between the development of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. "China's economic construction centers on heavy industry, which must be affirmed. But at the same time, attention must be paid to the development of agriculture and light industry." He also pointed out, "China is a large agricultural country, with more than 80% of its population living in rural areas. The development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture. Only when industry has raw materials and markets can it accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." In addition, it is necessary to actively develop coastal industries to accumulate strength to support inland industries; and to reduce the proportion of defense expenditure. Furthermore, Mao Zedong also proposed that the establishment of an independent and complete industrial system should be the main sign of achieving industrialization. Based on Mao Zedong's ideas, Zhou Enlai further elaborated on industrialization: "Our industrialization means that we need to have an independent and complete industrial system," "When we talk about establishing a basically complete industrial system in our country, we mainly mean that we are able to produce enough major raw materials, be able to independently manufacture machinery, not only general machinery but also heavy and precision machinery, be able to manufacture new and self-defensive weapons like atomic bombs, missiles, long-range aircraft in the field of defense; and we also need corresponding chemical industry, power industry, transportation industry, light industry, agriculture, and so on." These ideas are the enrichment and development of Marxist industrialization theory.
3. Preliminary Ideas for Economic System Reform
During the "First Five-Year Plan" period, China established a highly centralized economic management system following the Soviet model. While this system played a prominent role in the early stages of industrialization in a backward country, its drawbacks were also evident. The Soviet Union had already identified this issue when reflecting on the Stalinist model, and China's initial practice also deeply felt the need for change in the highly centralized economic management system. Mao Zedong and other central leaders repeatedly proposed changing the highly centralized economic management system in their summaries of China's construction experience. From May 1956, during the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1957, the Party made the initial attempt to reform the economic management system. This was mainly reflected in the following aspects:
(1) Devolving power from the central government to local governments. Mao Zedong raised the issue of the relationship between the central and local governments in the "On the Ten Major Relationships". He said, "What we need to pay attention to now is to consolidate unified central leadership while granting a bit more power to local governments, giving them more independence and letting them handle more affairs. Our country is so large, with such a large population and complex situations. Having both the initiatives of the central and local governments is much better than having only one initiative. We cannot centralize everything like the Soviet Union, squeezing local governments and depriving them of any discretion." Based on this, Zhou Enlai focused on studying this issue at the National System Conference held from May to August 1956. He pointed out that excessive centralization is equivalent to having no power, and devolving power from the central to local governments is to unleash the initiatives of local governments. He proposed expanding local powers in terms of planning, finance, enterprises, undertakings, basic construction, and organizational structure. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the need to adjust the relationship between the central and local governments correctly, improve the national administrative system based on the principles of unified leadership, hierarchical management, adapting to local conditions, and taking appropriate measures. This includes dividing the management scope of enterprises and undertakings, planning and finance, and appropriately expanding local management authority.
(2) Expand corporate power. "On the Ten Major Relationships" proposed: "It may not be appropriate to centralize everything at the central or provincial level, without giving factories any power, room for maneuver, or benefits. How much should the interests of the central, provincial and industrial factories be appropriate? We have limited experience and need further study." "Each production unit should have independence linked to uniformity, in order to achieve more lively development." Mao Zedong later stated in several speeches that enterprises should have "autonomy" and become open and legal "semi-independent kingdoms"; factories should have autonomy, which would be better for the industrialization of the whole country.
(3) "Three subjects" and "three supplements". In response to the increasingly uniform ownership and economic management structure, Chen Yun proposed the concept of building a "socialist economy beneficial to the people" and "three subjects, three supplements" at the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. This means that in industrial and commercial operations, state-owned and collective-owned enterprises are the main bodies, and a certain amount of individual businesses are supplementary to state-owned and collective-owned enterprises; planned production is the main body of agricultural and industrial production, and free production within the scope permitted by the state plan in response to market changes is supplementary to planned production; the national market is the main body, and the state-led free market within a certain range is supplementary to the national market. Zhou Enlai also said, "The mainstream is socialism, and a little freedom is given to the small ones. This can help the development of socialism." "In general, in industry, agriculture, commerce, education, except for the military, each profession can have a little freedom, and engage in some private ventures. Culture can also have some private ventures." Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, etc., referred to this policy of "eliminating capitalism and yet promoting capitalism" as the "New Economic Policy".
(4) Socialist economy should have both planning and diversity, and flexibility. Mao Zedong's idea of allowing the establishment of underground factories and promoting capitalism while eliminating capitalism at the end of 1956 actually represented the thoughts of many people in the central leadership. When Liu Shaoqi inspected the south in the spring of 1957, he elaborated on Mao Zedong's ideas. He said at the Shanghai Party Member Cadres Meeting: the characteristic of socialist economy is planned economy, "but actual social economic activities include various professions and aspects, involving thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of varieties. The national plan cannot plan thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of varieties, can only plan a limited number of categories, which simplifies and rigidifies social and economic life". To make our socialist economy "have several characteristics: planning, diversity, and flexibility, we need to use a free market." He later said, "When studying socialist economy, we must pay special attention to one issue, which is to make socialist economy have both planning and diversity and flexibility." We should learn from the lessons of the Soviet Union in this respect. They only have the planning aspect of socialist economy, they only focus on planned economy, which makes it rigid and lacks diversity and flexibility. "We must make our socialist economy more diverse and flexible than capitalist economy. If our economy is not more dynamic and diverse than capitalist economy, and only has rigid planning, then what superiority does socialism have? We must make the diversity and flexibility of our socialist economy surpass capitalism, make our people's economic life colorful, more convenient, and more flexible."
Although these important ideas were interrupted shortly after by the expansion of the Anti-Rightist Campaign, they nevertheless to some extent broke through the highly centralized planned economy model of the Soviet Union and surpassed the traditional understanding of socialism. In fact, they have already touched upon significant theoretical questions such as how to understand the relationship between socialism and capitalism, and between planned economy and market economy.
4. Thoughts on the Construction of Socialist Democratic Politics
(1) Preliminary proposal of the idea of multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China during the socialist period.
Around 1956, the Communist Party of China (CPC) based on our country's specific situation, summarized the experiences and lessons of the democratic revolution period and drew lessons from the international communist movement, explicitly proposing that the CPC, as the leading core, should establish a socialist cooperative relationship with various democratic parties. In April 1956, Mao Zedong first put forward the idea of "long live both the Communist Party and the democratic parties." He said, "Long live the Communist Party, and long live the democratic parties. They can keep an eye on us, which is also a form of democracy." In his work "On the Ten Major Relationships," he further proposed, "Is it better to have one party or several parties? It seems that several parties are better. Not only in the past, but also in the future, coexistence and mutual supervision are possible." He also said, "We should unite with democratic individuals who provide us with constructive suggestions," "We should continue to mobilize their enthusiasm," and "this is more advantageous for the Party, the people, and socialism." In September, when revising the political report of the Eighth Party Congress, Mao Zedong pointed out, "The form of proletarian dictatorship, either one-party system or multi-party system under the leadership of the working-class revolutionary party," because there will be differences due to different political and economic conditions in different countries. And such differences exist in any different nationality, and there may be even more in some nationalities. In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Mao Zedong emphasized the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" as an important issue in correctly handling contradictions among the people. In Mao Zedong's view, whether adopting a one-party system or a multi-party system, it must be combined with the actual conditions of the country and cannot be copied blindly. Liu Shaoqi emphasized at the Eighth Party Congress that we must adhere to the policy of "long-term coexistence and democratic supervision" in correctly handling the relationship between the Communist Party and various democratic parties and democratic individuals, and continue to strengthen and consolidate the united front of the people's democracy. Deng Xiaoping also pointed out that in the country's political life, we must give full play to the role of the democratic parties and allow them to play a bigger role in all aspects of national affairs. Therefore, the Party put forward the idea of "long live both the Communist Party and the democratic parties," which initially established a democratic political pattern of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the CPC. This is a socialist democratic model different from the Soviet model.
In addition, they proposed the ideas of expanding socialist democracy and strengthening the construction of socialist legal system. 
In July 1956, Zhou Enlai proposed, "Now our people's democratic dictatorship should be: dictatorship must continue, democracy must be expanded," "this is even more essential," "to solve this problem, we need to think of ways in our country's system." In response to this, Liu Shaoqi pointed out at the Eighth Party Congress that we should strengthen the supervision of the central government by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and the supervision of local governments by local people's congresses at all levels; we should further expand democratic life and carry out struggles against bureaucracy. At the same time, the Party also recognized that the realization of various democratic systems under socialism must be institutionalized and legalized. The political report of the Eighth Party Congress clearly stated that one of the urgent tasks in current state work is to systematically formulate more complete laws and improve the legal system. Dong Biwu proposed at the Eighth Party Congress that doing things according to the law means having laws to rely on and having laws to be enforced, which is "one of the main ways to eliminate the phenomenon of not attaching importance to and not abiding by national laws." After enumerating the incomplete aspects of our legal system, he pointed out the need to gradually improve the legal system and to promptly enact a series of laws such as the criminal law, civil law, litigation law, labor law, and land use law, and to accelerate the implementation of systems such as the lawyer system and notary system. These understandings and requirements reflect the Party's high attention to political democracy before and after the Eighth Party Congress and the direction of government management towards institutionalization and legalization.
5. On the Importance of Intellectuals and Scientific and Technological Issues, and the Persistence of the "Two 100s" Policy
Due to the unique national conditions of the socialist revolution and construction in underdeveloped countries, how to correctly handle the issue of intellectuals has always been a prominent problem. In China, because the revolutionary base was long established in rural areas far away from the cities, with the majority of the revolutionary forces being peasants, how to address the issue of intellectuals was also a very prominent problem. With the completion of socialist transformation and the comprehensive development of socialist construction, as well as the advent of the new world technological revolution, the importance of intellectuals and scientific technology has become increasingly prominent. However, at that time, some cadres within the party lacked awareness of the importance of intellectuals. There were differences in the understanding of the class attributes of intellectuals, and even a serious sectarian tendency that did not respect intellectuals. Through investigations, the Central United Front Department summarized the existing problems related to intellectuals as the "six lacks": underestimating their abilities, insufficient trust, improper arrangements, inappropriate utilization, unfair treatment, and insufficient support. In order to quickly change this situation, on November 22, 1955, Zhou Enlai reported to Mao Zedong on the issue of intellectuals and proposed to discuss it at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The next day, Mao Zedong convened a meeting of the members of the Central Secretariat and responsible officials from relevant departments of the central government, deciding to adopt Zhou Enlai's suggestion and hold a conference to comprehensively resolve the issue of intellectuals. In January 1956, the Central Committee held a conference on the issue of intellectuals. In his report titled "On the Issue of Intellectuals" at the conference, Zhou Enlai emphasized the importance of science, technology, and intellectuals. He pointed out that in the socialist era, there is a greater need than ever before to fully improve production technology and develop science and utilize scientific knowledge. Science and technology are "decisive factors in our national defense, economy, and culture." At this conference, the Party Central Committee put forward the call to "march towards modern science." To develop science and utilize scientific knowledge, it is impossible without the participation and efforts of the vast number of intellectuals. Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the conference that in order to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution, to develop science and eliminate ignorance, it is not feasible to rely solely on uneducated people; intellectuals are indispensable.
Based on a full affirmation of the political transformation and progress of intellectuals after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the conference on the issue of intellectuals made a new determination regarding their class attributes. In his report, Zhou Enlai announced that the majority of our intellectuals have become employees of the state, serving socialism, and have become part of the working class. In February, the Central Directorate's "Instructions on the Issue of Intellectuals" also pointed out that the appearance of intellectuals in our country has undergone "fundamental changes." The majority of them either actively support the Communist Party and socialism politically, or have taken a stand in support of the Communist Party and socialism. The basic force of intellectuals has become employees who serve socialism and are part of the working people. "In the construction of socialism, an alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals has been formed." With such understanding, the central government particularly emphasizes the need to give full political trust to intellectuals and make proper arrangements for their work, so as to fully harness their significant role in socialist construction. This greatly enhanced the sense of class belonging of intellectuals, and aroused their enthusiasm to devote themselves to socialist construction.
At the Intellectuals' Conference, Zhou Enlai emphasized the enormous role of science and technology in socialist construction. He stated that the socialist era requires a full improvement in production technology and the development and utilization of scientific knowledge more than any previous era. Considering the extremely backward state of science and technology in our country and the rapid advancement of world science and technology, he, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, put forward the call to "advance in science" and hoped to develop and improve our country's scientific and technological strength as much as possible, in order to catch up with the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time. After the conference, the Party Central Committee actively began formulating long-term plans for scientific and technological development to promote the development of various construction projects. In March 1956, the State Council established the Scientific Planning Committee. Under the organization of leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Nie Rongzhen, more than 600 scientists and nearly 100 Soviet experts were gathered. After several months of repeated discussions, they compiled the "1956-1967 Outline of Long-term Development of Science and Technology (Revised Draft)". Four emergency measures were also formulated in 1956 for certain particularly important yet relatively weak areas in our country. Under the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department, the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also organized a group of experts to compile a long-term plan for the development of philosophy and social sciences over a twelve-year period.
Recognizing the flaws in the Soviet cultural system, the Party put forward the fundamental principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to promote the prosperity and development of culture and science and technology. In the first few years after the founding of New China, under the background of fully accepting Soviet experience, the field of science and culture was influenced by the crude style and dogmatism of Soviet academic criticism, resulting in the promotion of one school of thought and the suppression of another, as well as the labeling of political tags and other phenomena, which were quite serious in some academic fields. In response to these situations, Mao Zedong requested the Central Propaganda Department to specifically study the problem of the dogmatic attitude towards Soviet scientific schools in scientific and academic research. In late April 1956, during the discussion of Mao Zedong's report on the "Ten Major Relationships" by the expanded meeting of the Central Political Bureau, it was proposed to distinguish political, ideological, artistic, and technical issues from academic, artistic, and technical issues. In order to develop culture and science, it was necessary to implement the two slogans Mao Zedong had previously put forward of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "a hundred schools of thought contend". The "Dual Hundred Policy" advocated the free development of different artistic forms and styles, and the free debate of different scientific schools, opposing the use of administrative power to enforce a certain style and a certain school. The premise for implementing the "Dual Hundred Policy" was that it must not violate the constitution. The implementation of the "Dual Hundred Policy" would not weaken but strengthen the leading position of Marxism in the intellectual world. In March 1957, in the National Propaganda Work Conference, Mao Zedong further pointed out, when discussing the question of "letting go" or "tightening up", that "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "a hundred schools of thought contend" is a fundamental and long-term policy, not a temporary one, showing a determined determination to promote the "Dual Hundred Policy". He even proposed that the Party's guiding ideology - Marxism - could also be questioned and criticized; if Marxism is still afraid of criticism and would collapse if criticized, then it should indeed collapse, because such Marxism is useless. This understanding and guiding ideology provided an open and relaxed democratic atmosphere for intellectuals to fully demonstrate their talents.
6. Thoughts on correctly handling ethnic relations.
During and after the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the party carried out various explorations in order to properly handle ethnic relations. In April 1956, the Party Central Committee issued instructions on inspecting the implementation of ethnic policies. Mao Zedong discussed the relationship between the Han ethnic group and ethnic minorities in "On the Ten Major Relationships," saying, "Our policy is relatively stable and receives the approval of ethnic minorities. We emphasize opposing Han chauvinism. Local nationalism should also be opposed, but generally it is not the main focus." On December 26 of the same year, the CPC Central Committee issued another set of instructions on conducting further inspections of United Front work and the implementation of ethnic policies, requiring localities to thoroughly inspect the implementation of ethnic policies and not rush to conclude the inspections. The following year, Mao Zedong once again emphasized in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," stating, "We must handle the relationship between the Han ethnic group and ethnic minorities well. The key to this problem is overcoming Han chauvinism. Among ethnic minorities that have local nationalism, local nationalism must also be overcome. Both Han chauvinism and local nationalism are detrimental to the unity of all ethnic groups and are contradictions among the people that must be overcome." This inspection work, which began in the middle of 1956 and concluded at the end of July 1957, lasted over a year and widely educated cadres and the people about the party's ethnic policies. It had significant historical significance for the correct implementation of ethnic policies, the healthy development of various undertakings in ethnic minority areas, and especially for the continuous strengthening of ethnic unity. The Eighth National Congress also attached great importance to the ethnic issue in socialist construction. Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report, "Correctly handling the ethnic minority issue is a major task in our national work. We must make greater efforts to help ethnic minorities make progress in economic and cultural areas so that they can fully play a positive role in our country's socialist construction." The report also stated that in order for ethnic minorities to develop into modern nations, in addition to carrying out social reforms, the fundamental key is to develop modern industries in their areas. It is necessary to continue building new industrial bases and establish large-scale modern industries and transportation systems in some ethnic minority areas. Attention must be paid to helping ethnic minorities form their own working class and cultivating scientific, technological, and managerial cadres. To adapt to the development of the situation and implement the Eighth National Congress' line, the CPC Central Committee United Front Work Department formulated the "Outline of the National Ethnic Work Plan for the years 1956 to 1967 (Draft)" and outlined the blueprint for economic and cultural development in ethnic minority areas. Preliminary achievements were made in the socialist construction of ethnic minority areas, and there were fundamental changes in the social aspect.
IV. The Eighth National Congress and the important development of thought and theory on party building
After the basic completion of socialist transformation, there were also important changes in the party's own situation and historical positioning. The party's ruling position was greatly consolidated, and the size of its members and party organizations nationwide achieved significant development. The party faced the task and goal of comprehensively building socialism. This brought new issues for party building and subjected the party to new historical tests. The high importance placed on strengthening the construction of the ruling party and the exploration of theories on party building before and after the Eighth National Congress holds an important historical position in the history of party construction and has made outstanding contributions to promoting the historical process of the Sinicization of Marxism.
1. The Communist Party of China is the core force leading the socialist construction.
The 8th National Congress emphasized that the Communist Party of China is the core force leading the socialist construction, and the socialist construction must adhere to the leadership of the Party. The General Program of the Party Constitution of the 8th National Congress stipulates: "The Party is the highest organization of the class, and it must strive to play its correct leadership role and core role in all aspects of national life." The political report of the 8th National Congress pointed out: "The Party should and can play a leading role in ideology, politics, and policy in all work." This means that the Party's leadership does not mean taking charge of everything, but its leadership needs to be specifically reflected in ideology, politics, and policy. The Party needs to realize its political program through its members and party organizations. The inclusion of the Party's correct leadership role into the Party Constitution and important political documents of the Party by the 8th National Congress represents a deepening understanding of the Party's leadership in power and is a development of Marxist party theory. In order to ensure the Party's correct leadership, the 8th National Congress conducted a thorough analysis of the Party and the country's situation, and in response to changes in the situation and tasks, proposed new ideas for strengthening the construction of the ruling party.
2. Adhere to the Party's collective leadership, improve the system of democratic centralism, strengthen the construction of internal and external supervision, develop intraparty democracy, and oppose personality cult.
Given the historical lessons learned from the Communist Party of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union in terms of party building and the shortcomings of the party's work, the 8th Party Congress emphasizes adhering to the principle of collective leadership of the party, improving the party's democratic centralism, strengthening the supervision of party organizations and party members (including internal party supervision and external party supervision), developing internal party democracy, and opposing cults of personality. Liu Shaoqi emphasized the principles of collective leadership of the party and expanding internal party democracy in the political report. He stated that all major decisions must go through thorough discussions, allowing unrestricted debates of different viewpoints, in order to comprehensively reflect the various opinions of the masses inside and outside the party and the different aspects of objective development. He firmly accepted reasonable opposing opinions or reasonable parts of opposing opinions. No exclusionary attitudes should be taken towards any comrade who raises opposing opinions through normal procedures. Deng Xiaoping elaborated on the issue of strengthening internal and external party supervision in the "Report on the Amendment of the Party Constitution". He said that we need to implement internal party supervision as well as supervision from the people and outsiders. The key to internal party supervision and external party supervision lies in developing the democratic life of the party and the country and promoting the fine traditions of our party.
To further strengthen and improve the party's leadership, the 8th Party Congress made some relevant provisions regarding the party and state systems. The Congress proposed that party members have the right to fully exert their creativity in their work. When they have different opinions on party resolutions, besides unconditional implementation, they have the right to reserve and present their own opinions to the party's leadership organs. If lower-level party organizations believe that the resolutions of higher-level organizations do not conform to the actual situation in their local areas or departments, they should request changes from the higher-level organizations. The 8th Congress emphasized the strengthening of party and state supervision, timely discovery and correction of various bureaucracies, and handling of various illegal and immoral words and deeds. The supervisory committees should not be limited to handling cases but also actively inspect the adherence of party members to the party constitution, party discipline, communist morality, and national laws and regulations. The 8th Congress also proposed that the regular convening and full play of the party's congress at all levels is one of the basic requirements of the party's democratic centralism. The party congresses at and above the county level should be transformed into permanent bodies, convening a meeting once a year, making it easier for the party committees at all levels to concentrate the opinions of the masses and making the congresses the highest decision-making and supervision authorities.
Deng Xiaoping also focused on preventing the deification of leaders and opposing cults of personality in the report on amending the party constitution at the 8th Congress. He pointed out that the situation in the Soviet Union shows how serious the consequences can be when individuals are deified. The cult of personality is a social phenomenon with a long history, and it will inevitably have some reflections in our party's life and social life. We must resolutely oppose behavior that highlights individuals and idolizes individuals, adhere to the combination of collective leadership and individual responsibility, and comprehensively implement democratic principles and the mass line. The new party constitution also added a clause stating that "when the Central Committee considers it necessary, it can establish an honorary chairman of the Central Committee," preparing to abolish the lifelong leadership position, which is a meaningful idea to implement reforms in the party and state leadership system. In addition, following Mao Zedong's multiple proposals, the 8th Party Congress did not mention "Mao Zedong Thought" in its guiding ideology. The 8th Congress set a precedent for opposing cults of personality at party congresses.
3. The ruling party must adhere to the mass line and resolutely oppose bureaucratism. 
Mao Zedong pointed out at the Eighth Preparatory Meeting that "this congress should continue to promote the fine traditions of our party in ideological and style aspects, effectively combat subjectivism and sectarianism, and in addition, oppose bureaucratism." Implementing and executing the mass line of the party was regarded as a historical task that the ruling party must focus on. Deng Xiaoping, in the Party Charter Report, combined the new situations and tasks facing the ruling party to profoundly and systematically expound on the important view that the mass line is the fundamental line of the party. He pointed out that our party was born, developed, grew strong, and matured through close contact and joint struggle with the people. The successful development of the party's cause depends on the correct implementation of the mass line, while failure to do so will cause damage to the cause of the party and the people. Due to our party becoming the ruling party, the danger of being detached from the masses and its potential harm has increased significantly compared to before. The existence of bureaucratism indicates that the party's mass line has not been fully implemented and executed within our party. We must continuously fight against these bureaucratism phenomena that are detached from the masses. It should also be recognized that bureaucracy is a legacy of the long period of ruling by the exploiting classes in human history and has far-reaching influence on social and political life. Therefore, implementing the mass line and overcoming bureaucratism is also a long-term struggle. Deng Xiaoping also emphasized that a prominent feature that distinguishes our party from any other political party is its wholehearted dedication to serving the people and closely connecting with the masses. The advanced nature of the Communist Party lies in the fact that "it serves the people wholeheartedly, reflects the interests and will of the people, and strives to help the people organize and fight for their own interests and will."
4. The ruling party must uphold party unity and consolidate party unity.
Deng Xiaoping pointed out in the report on the amendment to the Party Constitution that the unity and unity of the Party is one of the most important issues in Party building. Party unity and unity are the lifeblood and strength of the Party. It is the sacred duty of every Party member to always pay attention to maintaining Party unity and consolidating Party unity. This is not only in the interest of the Party, but also in the interest of the people of the whole country. When discussing the guidelines for dealing with Party members who commit mistakes, he pointed out that every comrade may have shortcomings or mistakes, and everyone needs help from others. Party unity is precisely for the development of this comradely mutual assistance. Different guidelines should be adopted for the shortcomings or mistakes of Party members in different situations. The emphasis should be placed on a realistic and objective analysis of the essence and root causes of the mistakes, rather than on organizational punishments that would weaken the Party's strength. On the other hand, indulging and turning a blind eye to the mistakes of comrades, not giving them the appropriate disciplinary action, and not engaging in ideological struggles is a tendency of liberalism and must be resolutely opposed. In order to maintain the unity and unity of the Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, it is necessary to greatly develop criticism and self-criticism within the Party. The new Party Constitution also regards "maintaining Party unity and consolidating Party unity" as the obligation of Party members.
5. The ruling party must set higher standards for Party members
Raising the standards of Party members is an important political task for the Party. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the victory of the Party's cause, the increasing responsibilities of the Party to the people, and the growing prestige of the Party among the people all require the Party to set higher standards for Party members. In order to raise the standards of Party members, the Eighth Party Constitution introduced some new regulations on the qualifications of Party members. The Party Constitution first requires that Party members must be those who engage in labor and do not exploit the labor of others. The Party Constitution has also added many new obligations for Party members, while also paying attention to protecting and expanding the democratic rights of Party members and adding new contents to their democratic rights. In addition, Deng Xiaoping also pointed out that if we set strict requirements for every ordinary Party member, we need to set even stricter requirements for Party cadres. They have higher responsibilities than ordinary Party members and should first learn to never detach from the masses, never be complacent or afraid of difficulties, be open to bottom-up criticisms, continuously improve their work, and lead by example and patiently educate the staff they manage.
The 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, based on the summary of the experiences and lessons of party building during the periods of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, emphasized the issue of building the ruling party. It put forward many new ideas, guidelines, and ideas in both theory and practice of party building, forming a relatively comprehensive and systematic theory of ruling party building, which provides direction for future party building. This is an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong's thought on party building, as well as a prerequisite and guarantee for advancing the Sinicization of Marxism. The understanding of this kind was achieved partly because the party gained initial experience in party building under the conditions of being in power during the previous seven years, and partly because the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union exposed some prominent problems in socialist party building. It is on such a basis that the 8th Congress has a deeper understanding of party building.
At the same time, it should also be noted that the 8th Congress had some historical limitations in terms of theory of party building. For example, the central leadership before and after the 8th Congress attached great importance to criticizing bureaucraticism, but mainly from the perspective of the remnants of the old society. They mainly positioned bureaucraticism as a style or moral issue, paying insufficient attention to institutional issues. Without delving into such a level of understanding, the struggle against bureaucraticism cannot achieve the intended purpose. Furthermore, the 8th Congress did not elevate the strengthening of intra-party democracy to a strategic level of understanding, and its thinking on the rule of law construction is also weak. In addition, many theories and ideas have not formed specific and operationally strong methods and policies. Because of these reasons, many important ideas, theories, and policies proposed by the 8th Congress often cannot be effectively implemented in practice.
V. The model of the Sinicization of Marxism: The theory of contradictions in socialist society.
1. The Thoughts of Marxist Classic Writers on Contradictions in Socialist Society
Regarding the issue of contradictions in socialist society, due to historical limitations, Marx and Engels did not directly experience it. Therefore, they did not provide idealistic solutions to the contradictions between the relations of production and productive forces, superstructure and economic base in the socialist and communist stages that were detached from objective reality. Although they also pointed out the existence of the "three major differences" between labor and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, these differences are essentially contradictions. However, they did not explicitly and systematically address the issue of contradictions in socialist society.
In 1920, Lenin clarified the method of observing and studying this issue when annotating and commenting on Bukharin's book "Economics of the Transition Period": "Antagonism and contradiction are not the same thing. Under socialism, antagonism will disappear, but contradictions will still exist." This viewpoint affirmed that in socialist society, there still exists another type of contradiction that is fundamentally different from class contradictions in the past, namely non-antagonistic contradictions. Lenin also philosophically distinguished between "antagonism" and "contradiction" as two different categories, which was a development of Marxist socialist theory. However, Lenin did not have the opportunity to conduct a specific and in-depth investigation and analysis of the contradictions in socialist society.
Stalin did not acknowledge the existence of contradictions in socialist society for a long time, only emphasizing the "complete conformity" of the relations of production and productive forces, as well as the "harmonious consistency" in politics and ethics. In 1938, in his article "On Dialectical and Historical Materialism," Stalin wrote: Under the socialist system, "the relations of production fully conform to the conditions of the productive forces because the social nature of the production process is consolidated by the public ownership of the means of production," and "the socialist national economy of the Soviet Union is an example in which the public ownership of the means of production fully conforms to the social nature of the production process, so there are no economic crises or destruction of productive forces in the Soviet Union." With the development of socialist construction practice, in 1952, Stalin began to recognize the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces under the socialist system in his book "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." He said: The term "complete conformity" should not be understood in an absolute sense... it should be understood that under the socialist system, conflicts between the relations of production and the productive forces generally do not occur, and society has the potential to promptly adapt outdated relations of production to the nature of the productive forces; "That is, even under the socialist system, there will be backward and inert forces that do not understand the need for changes in the relations of production. However, these forces are certainly not difficult to overcome and will not lead to conflicts." In short, in the writings of the Marxist classical authors, the problem of contradictions in socialist society is gradually recognized and is an issue brewing for significant breakthroughs.
2. The understanding of contradictions in socialist society by the leaders of the Communist Party after the establishment of the People's Republic of China
Regarding the issue of contradictions under socialist conditions, the leaders of the Communist Party had some important considerations and understandings at the beginning of the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In the first half of 1951, Liu Shaoqi already discussed in his article "On the Contradictions between the Public and Private Sectors in State-Owned Factories": "When the state led by the working class has been established and factories have been nationalized, and after the democratic reform has been carried out," "Within our state-owned factories, there are no more class struggles and exploitative relationships. The relationship between the factory management and the workers has fundamentally transformed into a comradely relationship." "There are no class contradictions within state-owned factories, but are there other contradictions?" After affirming this question, he pointed out: "The fundamental contradiction within state-owned factories" is the contradiction between the factory management and the workers, it is the contradiction between the public and private sectors within state-owned factories. This contradiction is completely different from the class struggle in a capitalist factory. It is a non-hostile contradiction that can be reconciled and harmonized." At that time, leaders such as Li Lisan and Deng Zihui also expressed these ideas.
The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the tremendous shock it caused in the international communist movement made Mao Zedong further realize that various contradictions still existed under the socialist system. Whether the internal contradictions among the people and the contradictions between us and the enemy could be correctly distinguished and handled was related to the success or failure of socialist construction and the survival of the people's political power. The Communist Party of China began to think and study more deeply the problem of contradictions in socialist society. "On the Ten Major Relationships" is an important work in which Mao Zedong, taking the Soviet Union as a lesson and starting from China's national conditions, discusses the problem of contradictions in socialist society. He pointed out, "These ten relationships in socialist construction are all contradictions. The world is made up of contradictions. Without contradictions, there would be no world. Our task is to correctly handle these contradictions." These ten questions already contained the idea of categorizing the contradictions in socialist society into two types, and practically proposed methods for dealing with contradictions of different natures, namely, distinguishing between us and the enemy in the contradictions between us and the enemy, and distinguishing between right and wrong in the contradictions among the people. "On the Ten Major Relationships" has an important historical position in the process of the emergence and development of the Communist Party of China's theory of two types of contradictions and can be regarded as an important achievement in the development of the theory of contradictions in socialist society.
In April and December 1956, the editorial department of the People's Daily successively wrote two articles, "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Revisited," based on the spirit of the expanded meeting of the Political Bureau. These articles, starting from summarizing the historical experience of the international dictatorship of the proletariat, explicitly put forward the viewpoint that contradictions still exist in socialist society, criticized the metaphysical view that denies contradictions, proposed the concept of "two types of contradictions," and pointed out that the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and the contradictions between the economic base and the superstructure, are the basic contradictions applicable to all societies. On December 4, 1956, Mao Zedong talked about the problem of the two types of contradictions, especially the contradictions among the people, in a letter. He said, "Society is always full of contradictions. Even socialist and communist societies are like this, but the nature of contradictions is different from that of class society. The existence of contradictions requires their exposure and solution. There are two methods of exposing and solving contradictions: one is between us and the enemy (that is, counter-revolutionaries), and the other is among the people (including within the party, and between parties). The former uses methods of suppression, while the latter uses methods of persuasion, namely, methods of criticism. The class contradictions in our country have basically been resolved (that is to say, they have not yet been completely resolved, they will continue to exist in the ideological field for a long period of time. In addition, a small number of counter-revolutionaries will also exist for a long time), and the people should unite. However, our internal problems will continue to emerge endlessly. The method to solve them is to start from unity, go through criticism and self-criticism, and achieve such a method of unity."
In the autumn and winter of 1956, in the face of the "disturbances" that occurred in some places in the country, Mao Zedong pointed out that we should adopt a positive attitude towards these disturbances. The reasons for them are "some are due to the existence of bureaucratism and subjectivism in leadership, political or economic mistakes have been made, and some are not due to incorrect policies, but rather incorrect working methods, too hard-line. Another factor is the existence of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements." Ultimately, this still reflects the contradictions between us and the enemy and the contradictions among the people in socialist society, with a large number of them being the contradictions among the people. Mao Zedong emphasized, "For any matter involving contradictions among the people and within the party, the method of rectification should be used, the method of criticism and self-criticism should be used to solve them, not force." He also specifically pointed out that during the period of revolution, we concentrated our efforts on class struggle, and the contradictions among the people were not prominent. During the period of construction, a part of class struggle was left, and a large number of them manifested as internal struggles among the people. Our experience in dealing with this is insufficient and worthy of study. This is a kind of science. This shows that correctly understanding and dealing with various contradictions in Chinese socialist society became a major topic for the Central Committee of the Party to think about during this period.
3. "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People"
In February 1957, Mao Zedong delivered a speech entitled "How to Handle Contradictions Among the People" at the 11th meeting of the highest state council. He systematically clarified the issue of distinguishing between the two types of contradictions in socialist society and correctly handling contradictions among the people. This speech was later organized, modified, and supplemented, incorporating the thoughts of Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and others on this issue. It was publicly published with the title "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People" in June of the same year. In this significant work of theoretical and practical significance, Mao Zedong conducted in-depth research and explanation of the contradictions in socialist society, forming a systematic and innovative theoretical system. This was a continuation and development of the Eighth Party Congress's line, demonstrating the theoretical height achieved in the process of China's Marxist Sinicization around 1956, and was a concentrated embodiment of the achievements in Marxist Sinicization before and after 1956.
Mao Zedong observed the contradictions in socialist society from the perspective of the law of unity of opposites, which is a fundamental law of the universe that exists universally in nature, human society, and people's thoughts. He pointed out, "In socialist society, the fundamental contradictions are still the contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production, and the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base. However, these contradictions in socialist society have fundamentally different natures and situations from the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces and the superstructure and the economic base in the old society." The fundamental difference lies in the fact that the contradictions in the old society, such as "the contradictions in capitalist society, manifest themselves as intense confrontations and conflicts, as intense class struggle. Such contradictions cannot be resolved by the capitalist system itself, but can only be resolved through socialist revolution. The contradictions in socialist society are another matter, quite the opposite. They are not antagonistic contradictions, and they can be continuously resolved through the socialist system itself." Mao Zedong believed that the socialist relations of production have already been established and are in line with the development of the productive forces. However, they are still far from perfect, and these imperfections are in contradiction with the development of the productive forces. In addition to the mutually adaptive and contradictory situation between the relations of production and the productive forces, there is also the mutually adaptive and contradictory situation between the superstructure and the economic base. After these contradictions are resolved, "new contradictions will arise, which will require people to resolve them." This was the first time in the history of the development of Marxism that a systematic theory of the basic contradictions in socialism was established, elevating the understanding of the laws governing the development of socialist society to a new theoretical level.
On this basis, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has established a new theory and new doctrine on the two types of contradictions in socialist society, and explicitly proposed that correctly handling contradictions among the people should be the theme of national political life. Mao Zedong pointed out that in socialist society, there are two types of social contradictions: antagonistic contradictions and contradictions among the people. Antagonistic contradictions are antagonistic in nature. Contradictions among the people can be divided into contradictions between the working people and contradictions between the exploited class and the exploiting class. The former is non-antagonistic, while the latter, in addition to its antagonistic aspect, also has a non-antagonistic aspect. Under socialist conditions, there are a large number of contradictions among the people. It is necessary to correctly distinguish and handle these two types of contradictions with different natures. For contradictions among the people, democratic methods, the "unity-criticism-unity" method, and methods of self-education should be used to resolve them. It is necessary to prevent the intensification of contradictions among the people, prevent the transformation of contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions, and at the same time, promote the transformation of antagonistic contradictions into contradictions among the people. He also proposed that correctly handling contradictions among the people should be the theme of national political life, and that a political situation should be created that has both centralization and democracy, discipline and freedom, unified will and individuals with relaxed and lively moods, mobilizing all positive factors both inside and outside the party and both domestically and internationally. Based on the historical experience of the united front, especially the active performance of the national bourgeoisie and various democratic parties in the socialist transformation, Mao Zedong put forward the judgment that "the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie belongs to contradictions among the people" and "the class struggle between the working class and the national bourgeoisie generally belongs to the class struggle among the people." This laid a new theoretical basis for adhering to and developing the united front of the people's democratic forces under socialist conditions. This is a great creation by Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, which combines the basic principles of Marxism with the specific conditions of China in theory and practice.
Of course, due to the limitations of the times, the theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people also has some imperfections. Nevertheless, the establishment of the theory of contradictions in socialist society is a concentrated reflection of the combination of Marxism and the actual situation in China after China entered socialist society. It is a major breakthrough by the Communist Party of China in Marxism and traditional socialist theory, and has greatly promoted the process of sinicization of Marxism.
Around 1956, guided by Marxism and based on a careful summary of the experiences and lessons of the international communist movement, the Communist Party of China made important explorations in many aspects of governance and put forward many new ideas and concepts different from the traditional socialist model with a spirit of innovation that keeps pace with the times. These ideological understandings significantly broke through the theoretical framework of traditional socialism and had rich new content and distinct national characteristics. They carried the distinctive aura of sinicization of Marxism, marking an important milestone in the sinicization of Marxism by the Party after the start of the comprehensive construction of socialism. It is a magnificent chapter in the history of the development of the Party's ideology and a significant milestone in the development of Mao Zedong Thought. The comprehensive exploration of socialist construction in China around the Eighth National Congress was the starting point of the second great revolution led by the Communist Party of China.
However, due to historical and contemporary constraints, the sinification of Marxism during this period was inevitably restricted in various ways. Some of these thoughts and theories were still imperfect, with certain theoretical defects and internal contradictions. Some, although correct, had not yet achieved universal consensus and had not become the guiding ideology of the entire party. Some were often more evident at the level of thought and theory, lacking specific operability in terms of policies and methods. These limitations of the era and theoretical shortcomings were the underlying reasons for the failure to achieve a "second leap" in sinification of Marxism in the 1950s and 1960s.

Chapter 6 Deviation of the Sinification of Marxism from the Correct Direction
Before and after the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, on the basis of a comparatively correct understanding of the national conditions and a summary of the lessons from the Soviet Union, our country, which had just started comprehensive socialist construction, achieved great achievements, and the first generation of the Party's leadership also made many important achievements in understanding the construction of socialism in China. However, it is regrettable and difficult to understand that this good development momentum was interrupted just six months later due to the struggle against the Rightists, and as a result, the sinification of Marxism also went astray.
At the beginning of comprehensive socialist construction, whether we realize it or not, we must confront several crucial fundamental questions, including "what is socialism," the main contradictions in socialism, and the methods to carry out socialist construction. The first question seems to have been addressed in many socialist countries, but in reality, the understanding is still relatively shallow. The second question is not a big problem for many countries because, according to the theories of Marxist classical writers and their own paths to seizing power and historical traditions, they reluctantly admit that there are contradictions in socialist countries, let alone regarding class contradictions as the main contradictions in socialism. In these countries, there may be mistakes in expanding class struggle, but theoretically, they tend not to consider class struggle as the main contradiction in socialist society. Even in a country like ours, which has a long tradition of intense class struggle, there was hardly any debate on the understanding of the main contradictions in the conception of socialism before the Eighth National Congress. It is precisely because of this that the "Cultural Revolution" repeatedly criticized the "revisionism within the Party" for making the wrong identification of the main contradictions in the Eighth National Congress and praised the establishment of class struggle as the main contradiction as a significant development of Marxism. The third question, which is based on the first two questions, specifically focuses on the practical and operational aspects. In the orthodox Stalinist model, the socialist economy is a highly centralized planned economy dominated by administrative power, with the market playing a minimal role. This model seems to adhere to Marx's original ideas on the surface because it greatly weakens the role of the law of value. Under the influence of administrative power and subjective will, this economic form is easily able to mobilize and arrange development at an unconventional speed, which is particularly suitable for achieving a catch-up strategy at a huge cost. This development strategy gradually became the object of socialist reform in the 1950s. Therefore, when our country began comprehensive socialist construction, it had to make a major choice: to adhere to the traditional model or to follow the model of reform. Looking back at 1956 and afterwards, there was a relatively consistent understanding among the Central Committee of the Party and Mao Zedong about the need to reform the traditional model. However, due to some deep-seated contradictions being yet to emerge, there were no significant differences in understanding within the central leadership regarding what should be reformed and how.
After the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, Mao Zedong and the Central Committee gradually deviated from the correct understanding of socialism achieved before and after the Eighth National Congress, and their understanding of the laws of socialist development gradually deviated from Marxism. There were serious deviations in the understanding of the main contradictions in socialist society, leading to mistakes in the expansion of class struggle. In terms of the scale and speed of economic construction, the "leftist" error of being eager for quick success and blind rush was committed, and the correct guidelines and policies of the Eighth National Congress were replaced by the so-called "Three Red Banners." The Party's exploration of the socialist path in China suffered a major setback, and the sinification of Marxism deviated from the correct direction. In the nine months from the end of 1958 to the first half of 1959, the Central Committee led by Mao Zedong once began to correct the discovered "leftist" mistakes and made some important progress. However, due to the limitations of rectifying the "leftist" errors, there were serious setbacks after the Lushan Conference.
I. The deviated rectification movement
1. The original intention of the rectification movement
Since the second half of 1956, when tumultuous waves swept through the international communist movement, certain tense situations also emerged in China's economic and political life. Dozens of strike incidents occurred nationwide, involving over 10,000 participants. There were also some incidents of unrest and withdrawal from collectives in rural areas, as well as dozens of student strikes. At the beginning of these events, both Mao Zedong and the central party leadership maintained a relatively clear understanding. Mao Zedong believed that the disturbances caused by a few individuals were mainly due to the existence of bureaucratic and subjective tendencies in the leadership, resulting in errors in political or economic policies. Some of them were also methods of work that were inappropriate and too rigid. He believed, "There are now some people who act as if they have the whole world in their hands, acting arrogantly and tyrannically. When the masses oppose such people and throw stones or swing hoes at them, I think this should happen, and I welcome it. Moreover, sometimes, only through confrontation can problems be resolved. When students hit the streets, when workers hit the streets, whenever such things happen, comrades should view them as good things." He also proposed, "In the future revision of the Constitution, I advocate adding the freedom to strike, allowing workers to go on strike. In this way, it will be beneficial for resolving the contradictions between the state and the workers." He earnestly cautioned the broad cadre and party members, "We must be vigilant and not foster a bureaucratic work style, not form an aristocratic class detached from the people. Those who commit bureaucratic tendencies, who neglect to solve the problems of the masses, scold the masses, suppress the masses, and never change, the masses have every reason to remove them. I say it's good to remove them, and they should be removed." Therefore, the way to resolve the disturbances caused by a few individuals is first to overcome bureaucratic tendencies and to expand democracy. Based on this understanding, the central leadership decided to launch a rectification movement throughout the entire party to overcome the existing problems and meet the requirements of the new tasks of comprehensive socialist construction.
The task of the entire party reformation is actually proposed by the Eighth Party Congress. In the opening speech of the Eighth Party Congress, Mao Zedong pointed out in connection with the Yan'an Reformation that there still exist among many of our comrades the thinking and style of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, which are detrimental to the unity within the party and the unity between the party and the people. These serious shortcomings must be vigorously overcome in order to do a good job in the great construction work before us. At the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee held in November 1956, taking the events then happening in Poland and Hungary as a warning, it emphasized that while considering both national construction and people's livelihood, we must be vigilant and guard against the specialization and detachment of cadres. It was decided to carry out a party-wide reformation in 1957, and the preparation and organization for it should start now. The Central Committee pointed out that the reformation is an effective method in the history of the Communist Party of China and in the future, the method of reformation and criticism and self-criticism must be used to solve all matters concerning the people, and all matters within the party, instead of using force. By using this method, we can unite the whole nation, mobilize all the positive factors among the 600 million people, and build socialism.
On March 8, 1957, Mao Zedong mentioned again the need for the party to launch the reformation movement in a discussion. He said, "The Central Committee should hold a meeting, issue instructions, prepare this year, and start next year. 'Reform' means to address subjectivism, with a focus on dogmatism; to address sectarianism, as they always want to dominate alone, thinking that the population of 600 million is too many, and fewer would be better; to address bureaucratism, which is prevalent. Reformation has not been carried out for several years." On the 12th, in his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference, Mao Zedong specifically discussed the reformation as the fifth issue. He said, "China's reform and construction rely on our leadership. If we rectify our style, we will be more proactive in our work, our abilities will be greater, and our work will be better." He explicitly announced: first reform within the party, voluntary participation from outside the party, criticize subjectivism (including dogmatism), sectarianism, and bureaucratism, overcome errors, and create an environment and habit of free criticism. The method of reformation, just like in Yan'an, is to study documents, criticize mistakes, practice small-scale democracy, and conduct gentle and patient persuasion, healing the sick and saving people, and opposing the method of killing people with a single blow.
After Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference were conveyed internally and externally within the party, they received strong reactions. The central government continuously issued notices, requiring party committees at all levels to take practical measures to strengthen the relationship between the party and the people. In the "Directive on Conveying the National Propaganda Conference" issued by the central government on March 16, it stated, "Currently, there are some abnormal conditions in the relationship between the party and intellectuals. The reason for this abnormal condition is that there are two anti-Marxist-Leninist ideologies within the party, namely dogmatism and right-wing opportunism. Dogmatism treats intellectuals, ideological issues, and learning Marxism in a rough, non-persuasive, condemning, and compulsory manner." "Right-wing opportunism, on the other hand, negates everything we have done in the past, only seeing the shortcomings and not the achievements, thereby losing confidence and depicting the great revolutionary and construction cause as pitch black." Therefore, it is necessary to oppose these two erroneous ideologies within and outside the party. In response to incidents such as workers' strikes, student strikes, and mass demonstrations that occurred at that time, the central government continuously issued the "Instructions on Strikes and Student Strikes" and the "Notice Regarding the Study of Several Important Issues concerning the Working Class." The central government believed, "The occurrence of such incidents is primarily due to our work not being done well, especially due to the bureaucratism of the leaders." To prevent such incidents from happening, the fundamental solution is to constantly adjust the problems existing within the internal relations of socialist society, "first and foremost, to overcome bureaucratism."
At the same time, Mao Zedong and other central leaders conducted inspections throughout the country, directly explaining to party members both inside and outside the party how to correctly handle internal contradictions among the people. In fact, this was also a mobilization of thoughts for the rectification movement. In March, Mao Zedong stated during a cadre conference in Shandong and Shanghai that through rectification, we should carry forward the tradition of our party's hard struggle. It is estimated that this rectification will bring considerable progress for our party. Regarding the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", Mao Zedong emphasized that it is not only the fundamental policy for the development of science and art, but also the fundamental policy for handling internal contradictions among the people under new historical conditions. "If we adopt this policy, literature, art, science, and technology will flourish, the party will always maintain vitality, the cause of the people will thrive, and China will become a powerful country and also be approachable by others." As for the shift in the focus of the entire party's work, he said, "With the basic end of class struggle, where should our tasks shift to? They should shift to development, leading the entire society, leading 600 million people, fighting against nature, making China prosperous, and turning it into an industrial country." He pointed out that in the 20th century, the first half of the century was devoted to revolution, and the second half was devoted to development; from now until the mid-21st century, it will take 100 years to build China well.
Liu Shaoqi also explained the meaning of the rectification movement in an internal conversation, saying, "Examine whether or not you have treated internal contradictions among the people as contradictions between enemies? Whether or not you have treated contradictions between enemies as internal contradictions among the people? Whether or not you have engaged in sectarianism without considering the interests of the 600 million people? We need to rectify this thinking." He particularly emphasized the significance of opposing bureaucratism: A large number of internal contradictions among the people are manifested in the contradictions between the masses and the leadership, or, more precisely, in the contradictions between the leadership's bureaucratism and the masses. "If the leadership does not commit bureaucratism, the problem can be resolved and the contradictions can be eased." He also pointed out that in some places, there were signs of a feudal system, which should be abolished.
2. From the rectification movement to the anti-rightist campaign.
On April 27, 1957, the Party Central Committee issued the "Guidance on the Rectification Movement" (referred to as the "Guidance"). The "Guidance" stated that since the Party had already held the position of governance nationwide and received the support of the broad masses, many comrades tended to deal with problems using simple administrative orders. However, some members with unstable positions easily became contaminated with remnants of the old social atmosphere, forming a sense of privilege and even using methods of suppressing and oppressing the masses. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out a widespread and in-depth rectification movement against bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism throughout the Party. The "Guidance" stipulated that the guiding ideology of the rectification movement was the two reports made by Mao Zedong in February at the expanded highest state council meeting and in March at the propaganda work conference held by the Central Committee. The theme of the rectification movement was to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The "Guidance" stated, "The transmission of these two reports has sparked enthusiastic discussions. As far as our Party is concerned, in fact, this is the beginning of the rectification movement"; this rectification movement should be a serious and gentle ideological movement, it should be a criticism and self-criticism movement that is appropriate, and it should adopt the methods of individual talking or holding small-scale discussions and group meetings, generally avoiding large-scale criticism or struggle meetings. Mao Zedong later pointed out that through the rectification movement, the Party hoped to achieve the following goals: to create a political situation characterized by both concentration and democracy, discipline and freedom, unified will, and personal comfort, liveliness, and vitality. On April 30, Mao Zedong said in a conversation with representatives of responsible persons from democratic parties and representatives of non-party democrats, "For several years we have all wanted to conduct a rectification movement, but we could not find an opportunity. Now we have found one. We have already created an atmosphere of criticism, and this atmosphere should continue. It is more natural to bring up the idea of rectification at this time. The main theme of rectification is to handle contradictions among the people and to fight against subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism." He hoped that through criticism from people from all walks of life, the Party's style could truly be improved, and he also envisioned solving the contradictions between the Party and democratic parties, as well as between the Party and intellectuals, through further improvement of the Party's specific leadership systems.
On May 1st, the People's Daily announced the Central Committee's instructions for rectification, and the rectification movement of the entire party began. After the rectification movement was fully launched, people from all walks of life widely and intensively expressed their criticism and opinions on the party's work in various symposiums and newspapers. In this process, in addition to a large number of criticisms of the various manifestations and harms of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in the party's work style, there were also some opinions that involved fundamental evaluations of the party's leadership, the socialist system, the various political movements since the establishment of New China, and the party's internal and external policies. In the latter half of May to early June, there were some speeches in newspapers and magazines that cast doubt on and denied the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. This aroused the vigilance of the Central Committee and Mao Zedong. Especially after the party changed from not advocating "speaking out" and "letting go" to advocating "speaking out" and "letting go" and supporting big-character posters, a nationwide political tension and an unstable state were artificially intensified. Although the Central Committee and Mao Zedong affirmed a large number of positive criticism, they lacked ideological preparation for opinions involving major political issues and some uncalm and angry remarks, and made excessive reactions, and thus made overly serious estimates of the domestic and international class struggle situation, turning the rectification movement into an anti-rightist struggle. The Central Committee believed that this was the frenzied attack of rightist elements on the party and socialism, and only by repelling the rightist attack could the rectification movement be carried out smoothly. The contradiction between the party, the people, and the rightists was antagonistic, irreconcilable, and a life-and-death struggle. To fight back against the rightists was a sharp struggle to defend socialism. "If we don't win this battle, socialism cannot be built, and there are certain dangers of the 'Hungarian incident'." Based on such guiding ideology, the theme of the movement shifted from properly handling internal contradictions among the people to fighting against the enemy, from internal party rectification to counterattacking the rightists, and from gentle and soft to "a large-scale ideological and political warfare". The struggle against the rightists followed the struggle method of mass political movements, but the development of the struggle was not prudently controlled, resulting in a serious escalation of the struggle. What's more serious is that the party's leaders, especially Mao Zedong, changed the relatively correct analysis of China's social major contradictions, classes, and class struggles as stated in the Party's Eighth Congress, gradually forming the theory of the expansion of class struggle. Mao Zedong pointed out, "The significance of criticizing the bourgeoisie and rightist elements this time should not be underestimated. This is a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. The socialist revolution in 1956 on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) alone is not enough, and it is not consolidated. The 'Hungarian Incident' is proof of this. There must also be a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts."
The original intention of the 1957 Rectification Movement was that the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong faced a historical situation of social transformation and upheaval. Guided by the theory of correctly handling internal contradictions among the people, it was an exploration and practice to comprehensively strengthen and improve the Party's construction while shifting the focus of Party work. These were inheritances and developments of the Eighth Route, marking a new effort to explore China's own socialist path. However, due to historical and practical limitations, the Rectification Movement, which originally had good intentions, quickly deviated from the correct direction. Broadly speaking, the issue of bureaucracy is a long-standing phenomenon that occurred along with the country. As long as there is management (national management, administrative management, corporate management, etc.) and hierarchical subordination, its existence is inevitable. Modern management, political science, and sociology often explain its causes, manifestations, and characteristics through the "hierarchical system". Bureaucracy and bureaucraticism are not primarily moral or style issues, nor are they just legacies of the "old society". They are more of an institutional problem. At that time, socialist countries implemented highly centralized planning systems, weakening the role of value laws and economic levers. Economic construction was carried out through a strict top-down administrative mobilization system, emphasizing the dominance of modernization processes with high-intensity administrative power. This greatly strengthened top-down hierarchical obedience, providing institutional resources and space for the growth of bureaucracy. In the process of pursuing catch-up strategies, during a certain stage of socialist development, the existence of this phenomenon was inevitable. Lenin keenly noticed this problem in the early practice of socialism and pointed out its harm to socialism. He correctly pointed out that it is necessary to limit and eliminate bureaucracy through broad participation of the masses in state management, even if everyone becomes a bureaucrat so that no one is a bureaucrat. In the mid-1950s socialist reforms, Yugoslavian and some Eastern European party leaders raised this issue without prior agreement. However, the understanding of this problem in young socialist countries was still preliminary and far from reaching a consensus. The understanding and resolution of this problem can only be expected to develop Marxism in line with the times and be scientifically resolved in the process of advancing the modernization of Marxism. Obviously, in the 1957 Rectification Movement, the understanding of bureaucracy had not yet deepened to the level of institutional reform. It was still mostly treated as a moral issue, a style issue, a legacy of the old society, and even a class struggle issue. While the Rectification Movement was important, it was even more important to solve institutional problems, and the Rectification Movement could not adopt the approach of the "Four Bigs", which was exacerbating contradictions and disrupting social stability.
On the one hand, there was an urgent desire to improve the Party's construction, but on the other hand, due to the limitations of the times, it deviated from the right path. On the one hand, new problems were put forward and attempts were made to solve them under the new situation, but on the other hand, inappropriate methods were used. On the one hand, attempts were made to solve various social contradictions that existed, but on the other hand, these contradictions were further intensified, and then dealt with by magnifying them. The negative consequences of this deviation were severe. It not only seriously undermined China's political and economic development but also seriously interfered with the second leap in the Sinicization of Marxism theoretically.
3. The Deviation of the Anti-Rightist Movement and the Understanding of the Main Contradiction in Socialism
The Anti-Rightist Movement has greatly expanded and caused long-term and serious consequences. The rectification movement, originally intended to address internal contradictions among the people, ended up confusing and conflating two different types of contradictions. Instead of creating a vibrant political atmosphere, the rectification movement severely undermined democratic life within and outside the party. Some effective attempts in economic life, such as beneficial explorations in agricultural cooperatives based on the prevailing productive forces at the time and new ideas for a limited reopening of private economy, were either criticized or abandoned. Expressing concerns about the rapid pace of economic development was regarded as approaching Rightist views and also faced criticism. In terms of political ideas and cultural life, the implementation of socialist democracy and legal construction, as well as the policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," all suffered significant damage.
However, the most serious consequence of the greatly expanded Anti-Rightist Movement is that it altered the Eighth Party Congress' diagnosis of the primary contradictions in our society through the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.
After the war, with the emergence of the socialist camp and the development of the international communist movement, the question of how to understand and handle contradictions in socialist society and the issue of the primary contradiction became increasingly prominent before the ruling party of socialist countries. The Eighth Party Congress promptly provided a relatively scientific answer to this question. By correctly identifying the new primary contradiction, it stipulated that the country's main task was to "protect and develop productive forces" under the new production relations, and the whole party should concentrate its efforts on developing productive forces. This is the most important theoretical contribution of the Eighth Congress and has become the consensus of the entire party.
However, the description of the main contradictions in the Eighth Congress is still inaccurate and still carries some limitations in dealing with the issues of class and class struggle. At the time of the Eighth Congress, the socialist transformation had basically been completed, and it should have declared the basic end of the transitional period. However, the Eighth Congress failed to provide a clear explanation of the end of the transitional period or when it would end, instead estimating the transitional period to be very long. The political report of the Eighth Congress no longer understood the transitional period as "from the establishment of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation", but as "from the establishment of the People's Republic of China to the realization of industrialization", extending the lower limit of the transitional period to the end of the third Five-Year Plan, i.e. 1967. Extending the subjective time limit of the transitional period may result in an exaggeration of the contradictions and struggles between the working class and the bourgeoisie, the socialist path and the capitalist path. Originally, the understanding was that this period was filled with class struggle. This laid the foundation for the transformation of the understanding of the main contradictions of socialism and the expansion of class struggle, providing theoretical justification.
Mao Zedong realized the flaws in the theoretical expression of the Eighth Congress resolution, and also raised criticism, but it was limited to phrases such as "linguistic problems" and did not oppose the basic spirit of the Eighth Congress's understanding of the main contradictions. With the changes in the domestic and international situation, Mao Zedong also occasionally showed some doubt and skepticism about this judgment, but in the six months after the Eighth Congress, his understanding of the main contradictions within the country was basically correct. In November 1956, Mao Zedong affirmed at the speech of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee that "the major internal class contradictions in our country have been basically resolved." In the same month, in a letter to Huang Yanpei, he again affirmed that "the class contradictions within our country have basically been resolved." In the early 1957, in his writings and propaganda regarding the issue of internal contradictions among the people, he repeatedly emphasized the view that "class struggle has basically ended."
Shortly after the Eighth Congress, the events in Poland and Hungary occurred one after another. The Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong, on the one hand, continued the exploratory approach after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, further proposing a doctrine for correctly handling the two types of contradictions in socialist society, in an attempt to avoid such events from happening in China. On the other hand, Mao Zedong believed that the occurrence of the Polish-Hungarian events was due to the failure to handle class struggle well, and then emphasized the role of class struggle in socialist society, shifting the focus of criticism from dogmatism to revisionism. Based on this understanding of contradictions, shortly after the rectification movement was launched, Mao Zedong made a serious and unrealistic estimation of the domestic class struggle situation, thus launching the anti-rightist struggle. One important consequence of the expansion of the anti-rightist struggle was that the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee changed the correct judgment of the Eighth Congress's first meeting regarding the social class conditions and main contradictions in our country, and instead believed that "the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the contradiction between the socialist path and the capitalist path, without a doubt, these are the main contradictions in our country at present."
The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress held in May 1958 further promoted the development of the theory of the expansion of class struggle. The conference affirmed: "The experience of the Rectification Movement and the struggle against the Rightists once again proves that during the entire transitional period, that is, before the establishment of socialist society, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and the capitalist road, always constitute the principal contradictions within our country." The deviation of the Eighth Congress's line from the main contradiction in socialist society profoundly and profoundly affected the process of socialist construction in our country. It became the basic reason for the subsequent occurrence of various errors, including undermining socialist democracy, damaging the construction of the ruling party, frequently launching political movements, and escalating the expansion of class struggle, for the next 20 years.
However, it should also be noted that the significant revision of the main contradiction made by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Congress and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Congress were still preliminary and far from reaching the level of making class struggle the mainstay after the Tenth Central Committee of the Eighth Congress. The most obvious sign here is that while the Eighth Congress's line was modified and the class struggle was established as the main contradiction, at the same time, the Central Committee and Mao Zedong emphasized the need to launch a peak of production construction, to have a "major leap forward" in the production front, to "surpass Britain and catch up with the United States," and so on. This means that the main contradiction and the main task are not the same thing, which is somewhat similar to the relationship between the main contradiction (referred to as the basic contradiction at that time) and the central work after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Congress in 1949. At the Nanning Conference held in January 1958, Mao Zedong put forward the idea of "continuous revolution," believing that in 1956, the basic victory of the socialist revolution was achieved in terms of the ownership of the means of production, and in 1957, the Rectification Movement and the struggle against the Rightists achieved a basic victory in the political and ideological fronts of the socialist revolution. Now it is necessary to have a technological revolution and shift the emphasis of the Party's work to technological revolution. This shift of work emphasis is a continuation of the correct strategic thinking of transforming from revolution to construction that was repeatedly emphasized before and after the First Plenary Session of the Eighth Congress, but it does not unite with the main contradiction determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Congress.
This severe state of self-contradiction indicates that the understanding of class struggle as the main contradiction at that time was still preliminary and unstable, and seemingly, there were still various possibilities for development. However, once such a main contradiction is established, it has a self-reinforcement function, especially when it is combined with a highly centralized planned economic system and leadership system. Because this combination can only greatly weaken socialist democracy, it is difficult to tolerate different opinions and engage in equal discussions on various issues. The simplest and most convenient method to suppress different opinions is to accuse the other party of being bourgeois or being influenced by the bourgeoisie at any time. The most obvious example is at the Lushan Conference in 1959, where Mao Zedong easily turned the differences in economic construction within the party into the reflection of class struggle within the party, thereby extending class struggle to the party and launching a large-scale struggle against the "Rightist" tendency. This not only further developed economic errors but also further expanded the error of the expansion of class struggle. If the main contradiction and the main task were still in a contradictory and unstable dual state before, the contradiction quickly narrowed and the unstable dual state gradually ended after the Lushan Conference.
The rise of the socialist reform movement in the 1950s and the emergence of ideological liberation provided a rare historical opportunity for the Chinese Communist Party to break free from the Stalinist model and achieve a "second combination" of Marxism and the Chinese reality. However, breaking away from the old model does not necessarily mean smoothly finding a new correct model, and sometimes subjectively thinking that one has broken away from the old model when in fact only superficial aspects have been touched upon without addressing the fundamental issues. While there are certainly difficulties in understanding, the fundamental reason lies in the damage to socialist democracy caused by the escalation of class struggle. Once this kind of democracy is weakened, the sinicization of Marxism loses its foundation for survival. Due to mistakes in the main contradiction, the party's exploration of the socialist path deviated from the correct direction, and the "second combination" of Marxism and the Chinese reality also went astray.
Secondly, the "Great Leap Forward": an extreme strategy of catching up
In exploring the path of socialist construction in China, besides the main contradiction of socialism, there are also issues such as the scale, speed, and methods of socialist construction. From 1957 to the end of the "Cultural Revolution", the party made serious mistakes in these two fundamental issues. Starting in 1957, while making wrong judgments on class struggle during the socialist period, there were also serious errors in the haste of socialist construction.
1. Leap Forward and Anti-Leap Forward
Generally speaking, independent emerging nations after World War II could no longer follow the industrialization path of the old capitalist countries. Economically, they often adopted a strategy of rapid development to catch up, aiming to quickly develop their own economy. This was also a common development strategy adopted by socialist countries at the time. Under the circumstances at that time, this development strategy had a certain rationality and inevitability. After the establishment of New China, the Communist Party formed a strategy of catching up. It was influenced by the Soviet model and had a profound understanding of China's national conditions and the severe international situation at the time. As Mao Zedong said, the current state of "being poor and blank" "keeps us in a passive state, feeling mentally still constrained. We have not yet been liberated in this respect." If we do not develop production as quickly as possible, there is a risk of being expelled from the "ball game". This raised the catching-up strategy to a political height that was vital to the life and death of Chinese socialism.
The proposal of the "Great Leap Forward" reflected the Party's attempt to combine Marxism with the construction of Chinese socialism, break free from reliance on the Soviet model, and explore its own path of building socialism. As early as the later stage of the First Five-Year Plan, there had been a tendency of impetuous leap forward in the process of agricultural cooperativization. In the first half of 1956, after the pace of socialist transformation accelerated, higher requirements and standards were also put forward for the scale and speed of national economic construction. When preparing for the Eighth National Congress, Mao Zedong proposed that the central idea of the Eighth Congress report should be to oppose right-wing conservatism. He demanded that the Communist Party should be a "promoting faction", and everyone should be a promoter and not a hindering faction. In early 1956, due to the accelerated development in various sectors, it caused a tense situation in finance and materials. The leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council responsible for economic work promptly discovered the tendency of impetuous leap forward and made efforts to correct it. Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, Liu Shaoqi, and others successively proposed to oppose the conservative thinking in economic construction while also opposing the tendency of impetuous leap forward. On June 20, 1956, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Political Bureau meeting, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "We Must Oppose Conservatism and Impetuous Emotions", playing an important role in mobilizing the whole party, especially leaders at all levels, to pay attention to correcting the tendency of impetuous leap forward in economic work. In this way, after several months of efforts, the momentum of blind impetuous leap forward in economic construction was initially curbed.
However, after the Anti-Rightist Movement, Mao Zedong increasingly expressed dissatisfaction with the "anti-excess" campaign. He believed that the "anti-excess" campaign not only dampened the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism but also provided an opportunity for the rightists to attack. The victory of the Rectification and Anti-Rightist Movement boosted the enthusiasm of the masses to an unprecedented level, and Mao believed that economic construction should be accelerated. Mao Zedong's speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party not only changed the judgment of the primary contradiction in Chinese society made at the First National People's Congress, but also changed the anti-conservative and anti-excess policies confirmed at that congress. The anti-"anti-excess" campaign rekindled the impulsive mood of seeking quick success and instant benefits within the Party.
2. The Rise of the "Great Leap Forward" Movement
During the Rectification, some factories and rural areas witnessed rapid growth in production, leading many to believe that it was entirely possible to carry out construction at a much faster pace than the "First Five-Year Plan" nationwide. This strengthened Mao Zedong's absolute understanding of the counteracting effect of the superstructure and the role of class struggle, and also reinforced his determination to counter the "anti-excess" sentiment. In late October 1957, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party released the "Revised Draft Outline for National Agricultural Development from 1956 to 1967". On October 27, the People's Daily published an editorial titled "The Great Outline for Building Socialist Rural Areas", demanding that "all aspects of work related to agriculture and rural areas achieve a giant leap forward, if necessary and possible, within twelve years", thus putting forward the slogan of "leap forward" in the central organ of the Communist Party. On November 13, the People's Daily published another editorial entitled "Mobilizing the Whole People, Discussing the Forty Main Points, and Igniting a New Upsurge in Agricultural Production". The editorial criticized those who were plagued by right-leaning conservatism and crawled slowly like snails, asserting that they failed to understand that after the agricultural collectivization, the conditions and necessity for a big leap forward in the production front had been established. The editorial believed that the achievements of 1956 fully reflected the correctness of this leap forward development, while those with right-leaning conservative thoughts regarded the correct leap forward as "excessive". Influenced and stimulated by the Soviet Union's proposal to surpass the United States in fifteen years at the Moscow Conference of 1957, Mao Zedong proposed in November 1957 that China should surpass the United Kingdom in steel production within fifteen years. The Party Central Committee accepted Mao Zedong's slogan to surpass the United Kingdom and declared this goal. The People's Daily published an editorial, demanding that various regions and departments criticize the "right-leaning conservative" thoughts and revise the original development plans in accordance with the "Outline for Agricultural Development" and the requirements of "surpassing the United Kingdom". Soon, new high targets were universally proposed from the central to local levels, triggering a high tide in agricultural production and marking the beginning of the "Great Leap Forward" movement.
The rise of the peak of agricultural production made Mao Zedong believe even more in carrying out political struggles to criticize right-wing conservative thinking, mobilizing large-scale mass movements, and accelerating the pace of economic construction. In a series of central meetings held in the first half of 1958, Mao Zedong criticized "ultra-leftism" more severely, proposed a series of tasks, indicators, slogans, and methods for launching the "Great Leap Forward" movement, effectively denied the valuable successful experience accumulated by the Party and the people in practice from the recovery of the national economy to the first five-year plan period, as summarized by the Eighth Party Congress, and also denied the collective experience and wisdom of the central leadership. After the Anti-Rightist Movement, the Party's principle of collective leadership and democratic centralism has been undermined, making it difficult for the Party to effectively prevent and correct major decision-making errors caused by the personal misunderstandings of the Party's top leaders. These meetings made sufficient ideological and public opinion preparations for the launch of the "Great Leap Forward" movement.
In May 1958, the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Party Congress was held. Based on Mao Zedong's proposal, the conference adopted the general line of "working with enthusiasm, striving to surpass, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more cost-effective manner." The proposal of the general line of socialist construction reflects the urgent desire of the broad masses to change the backward economic and cultural situation in our country, but it neglects the objective economic laws, denies the comprehensive balance law of the national economy, exaggerates the counteraction of subjective desires and human will, and makes blind pursuit of speed the dominant guideline in economic work. The conference also strongly criticized the "anti-ultra-leftist" work in the second half of 1956, calling on all regions and departments to "remove the white flag and raise the red flag," thereby promoting the trend of ostentation and greatly inflating the thought of "leftism" eager to achieve immediate results. After the conference, the "Great Leap Forward" movement was launched in all aspects throughout the country, and it quickly reached its climax. While promoting economic construction to "leap forward," the academic, scientific, sports, and health sectors also proposed their own "leap forward" plans and set many struggle goals that future generations find hard to believe. For example, many places put forward requirements for everyone to be able to read, write, calculate, watch movies, sing, paint, dance, perform, and create. Under the requirements of the "writing center," "singing center," and "painting center," writers and artists were required to develop their own "leap forward" plans and create a large number of "creative satellites."
In August 1958, the expanded meeting of the Central Political Bureau held in Beidaihe did not make any efforts to correct the serious exaggeration and chaos in practical life. Instead, it supported and pushed the "Great Leap Forward" movement to its climax. After the meeting, the "leftist" errors characterized by high targets, blind command, exaggeration, and the "communist wind" spread widely throughout the country, causing great damage to social productive forces. After the Lushan Conference in 1959, under the call of "anti-rightist" work, a new wave of the "Great Leap Forward" and errors such as the "communist wind" spread again, directly leading to three years of severe difficulties in the national economy.
On the surface, the "Great Leap Forward" movement had some similarities with the catch-up strategies implemented by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries during the same period. However, from the beginning of this movement, Mao Zedong saw it as an attempt to break away from the Soviet model and as an innovation and development of Marxist Chinese characteristics. He believed that the Soviet construction did not fully mobilize the masses or fully utilize the advantages of the socialist system. The Soviet Union did not educate and mobilize the masses with communist ideology and did not engage in mass movements, resulting in a lackluster construction speed. On the other hand, China, through the Anti-Rightist Campaign, achieved a victory over the bourgeoisie and their ideology. The spiritual state of the people greatly improved, creating favorable political and spiritual conditions for surpassing the Soviet model and advancing economic development at a higher speed. This understanding, which took shape in 1957 and 1958, developed into the concept of "emphasizing revolution and promoting production" during the "Cultural Revolution". The Soviet model indeed needed reform and breakthrough, but due to unfamiliarity with modern economic laws and the simplistic and empirical approach of blindly copying mass movement methods from the wartime period, as well as dogmatically adopting certain ideas from classic writers on communism, this catch-up strategy quickly exceeded reasonable boundaries. It led to the rapid expansion of subjectivism, empiricism, and voluntarism, severely damaging the development of our country's productivity.
The extreme catch-up strategy of the "Great Leap Forward" movement was indeed different from the Soviet model and did break away from it. However, it neither conformed to the basic principles of Marxism nor aligned with the actual conditions of China. In fact, it distorted the correct direction of the Chinese Marxist transformation.
III. The rush to transition to people's communes.
The movement of people's communeization that accompanied the "Great Leap Forward" campaign was a transformation of production relations, forms of production and living organization, and the transition from socialism to communism.
1. The origin of the movement of people's communeization
This sudden change in production relations was initially triggered by the movement of merging small agricultural production cooperatives into larger ones, which was originally a response to specific needs in the context of water conservancy and basic agricultural construction. After the socialist transformation and the rectification movement against the Right, the Party Central Committee believed that the socialist revolution had achieved great victories both in the economic and political ideological fronts, which undoubtedly greatly inspired the enthusiasm and drive of the broad masses in socialist construction, and would inevitably propel economic development at a pace surpassing that of the Soviet Union. Against this background, a peak of large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction emerged from winter 1957 to spring 1958 in rural areas. During this peak, many places started to break through the scale of existing agricultural cooperatives, demanding mergers and attempting to solve the problems of unified planning and centralized labor, materials, and funds through such mergers. The merger movement during this period played a certain role in strengthening the power of collective cooperation and enhancing basic agricultural water conservancy construction in some areas. Mao Zedong attached great importance to this, raising the issue of establishing large communes and instructing the drafting of relevant documents on the merger of large communes. With his affirmation and advocacy, the work of merging cooperatives quickly began. Under the influence and promotion of the "Great Leap Forward" atmosphere, the merger movement quickly developed into a mass movement that disregarded objective conditions and was eager to transition agricultural collective production organizations into so-called higher forms. At that time, Mao Zedong and other central leaders believed that the larger the scale of agricultural cooperatives and the higher the degree of collectivization, the more it would promote production. The large communes formed by the merger of smaller cooperatives were considered an effective organizational form for the "Great Leap Forward" in agricultural production.
At the beginning of the civil society, the cooperatives were simply larger in scale than the original cooperatives, and they were not entirely the same as the later people's communes that combined politics and society. However, through the preparations for several central meetings at the beginning of 1958, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and other central leaders began to contemplate changing the organizational structure of rural grass-roots organizations and achieving the unity of society and countryside. They discussed the idea of establishing "people's communes" on different occasions. In late April, while traveling to Guangdong by train, Liu Shaoqi, together with Zhou Enlai, Lu Dingyi, and others, mentioned "communes, utopia, transition to communism," as well as "utopian socialism, nurseries, collectivization, collective living, schools in factories, and factories in schools, half work and half study." In late April, when Mao Zedong discussed the future organization of China's rural areas with Liu Shaoqi and others, he said: "At that time, there will be many communist communes in our countryside, each commune having its own agriculture, industry, universities, middle schools, primary schools, hospitals, scientific research institutions, shops, service industries, transportation services, nurseries, public canteens, clubs, and police officers to maintain public security, and so on. Several rural communes will revolve around cities and become larger communist communes. The utopian ideas of the past will be realized and surpassed. Our educational policy and other cultural and educational undertakings will also develop towards this goal." This vision of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and other leading comrades spread through the speeches of some representatives during the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Congress. Some regions responded to the call, and organizations with the name "commune" appeared in June. On June 30th, Liu Shaoqi made it clear in a conversation: "The grass-roots organization of communist society is now being experimented with... It is no longer possible to have farmers solely engaged in farming and workers solely engaged in work. Right now, agricultural cooperatives have already begun to operate factories, businesses, banks, service industries, laundries, canteens, and schools, all under their control. In the future, we will have gun drills in factories, rural areas, and schools. We will have workers, peasants, businessmen, students, and soldiers.... I think that it will take thirty to forty years before we can achieve a communist society." 
In July, Chen Boda published two articles, "A Brand-new Society, A Brand-new Person" and "Under the Banner of Comrade Mao Zedong," in the third and fourth issues of the magazine "Red Flag," respectively, revealing Mao Zedong's thoughts on establishing people's communes. The articles stated: "Comrade Mao Zedong said that our direction should gradually and orderly make 'industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and defense' into a large commune, thus forming the basic unit of our country's society." "Transforming a cooperative into a grass-roots organization that combines both agricultural and industrial cooperatives is essentially the formation of a people's commune that integrates agriculture and industry." In August, Mao Zedong inspected rural areas in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces, encouraging the establishment of communes and large-scale communes. He mentioned several times: "I think a farm is not as good as a people's commune," "A people's commune is still better." Afterward, he repeatedly reiterated this idea and pointed out the characteristics of the people's commune, namely, large and public. Its advantages lie in the integration of workers, peasants, businessmen, students, and soldiers, which facilitates leadership. After these thoughts were published in newspapers, the whole country responded and pushed for the establishment of people's communes nationwide.
In this situation, the Beidaihe Conference held from August 17 to 30, 1958 officially decided to establish people's communes in rural areas nationwide, and passed the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas" (hereinafter referred to as the "Resolution"). The "Resolution" believes that the merger and transformation of smaller agricultural production cooperatives into larger people's communes, which integrate agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and the military, and have a higher degree of collectivization, is the inevitable trend for the leap development of rural production and the rapid improvement of farmers' consciousness. It is "the basic policy that must be adopted to guide farmers to accelerate socialist construction, build socialism in advance, and gradually transition to communism." In terms of ownership, although the "Resolution" points out that there is no hurry to change collective ownership into public ownership, it emphasizes that in the collective ownership of people's communes, there are already elements of public ownership, which will continue to grow in continuous development. The faster ones will take three to four years, and the slower ones will take five to six years or even longer to gradually replace collective ownership. Such provisions became the basis for the rushed transition and strong promotion of "communist wind" in the movement to establish people's communes. The "Resolution" also attributes significant strategic significance to the people's commune, believing that it "will be the best organizational form to build socialism and gradually transition to communism, and it will develop into the grassroots unit of future communist society"; "we should actively use the form of people's commune and explore a specific path for the transition to communism." The movement to establish people's communes and the people's commune system formed reflect the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong's understanding of socialism at that time and their keen pursuit of the communist ideal. It reflects the party's urgent subjective intention to "Sinicize" and "modernize" Marxism. However, history has proven that the movement to establish people's communes is only a product of the combination of the traditional socialist model and some historical traditions in China. Behind this "new thing" are only some outdated ideas and traditions.
2. Features of the movement to establish people's communes
After the Beidaihe Conference, rural areas throughout the country started a movement to establish people's communes without regard for objective conditions, and rapidly formed a climax of establishing large-scale people's communes, completely breaking through Mao Zedong's requirement of piloting first and achieving communization next spring. By the end of October, people's communes had been established in over 26,000 areas across the country, and the number of households in the communes accounted for over 99% of the total number of rural households. Thus, in less than two months, rural areas across the country achieved communization. At the same time, some provinces and cities were also carrying out pilot projects of people's communes in urban areas.
The People's Communes had strong elements of utopian socialism and military communism. One of the core principles of this socialist ideology was equality. This "equality" was embodied in the People's Communes, which aimed for the purity of socialist ideals with the concept of "one big and two publics." Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized that the defining characteristic of the People's Communes was that they were large in scale and had a high degree of collectivization. Essentially, each People's Commune was based on a rural village, and at times, several villages or even a county would be organized into one commune. The economic functions of the People's Communes encompassed almost all sectors and industries, including agriculture, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, finance, education, health, and defense. The People's Communes became the grassroots organizational base of the state power. This organizational form, which combined government and society with the integration of work, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, implemented a labor organization and way of life characterized by "militarization, combatization, and collectivization." It weakened social division of labor and exchange, rejected material interests and market economy, and pursued both "bigger and comprehensive" and "smaller and comprehensive" approaches, establishing its own self-contained system. What is even more significant is that the People's Communes were eager to transition to a singular form of state ownership. Through the commands of various levels of administrative power, all means of production and private property of the advanced communes were forcibly transferred to the communes without compensation. The self-owned land, self-raised livestock, self-operated forest land, and some larger-scale production tools, as well as privately owned houses and livestock held by commune members in the process of agricultural collectivization, were all regarded as remnants of private ownership and were converted into communal property. At the same time, in order to vigorously eliminate the so-called "bourgeois rights," the commune implemented an egalitarian supply system.
From a deeper perspective, the emergence of the People's Communes was a simplistic interpretation and application of some of the Marxist theories on socialism. It simply transplanted the experiences of the war era onto the economic construction in peacetime. It blurred the boundaries between collective ownership and state ownership, socialism and communism, as well as different stages of socialist development, exhibiting obvious utopian characteristics. The movement towards the People's Communes intended to go beyond and apply Marxism, but in reality, it distorted Marxism with dogmatism and pragmatism. It represented a regression in socialist ideology.
The movement towards the People's Communes was launched by our party and Mao Zedong with the aim of rapidly developing the productive forces, but the party had insufficient understanding of the laws of economic development and the basic conditions of the Chinese economy at that time. Eager for quick success and exaggerating the role of subjective will, the movement was rashly initiated. This was a major mistake that occurred during the process of exploring the path of socialist construction and a setback in the sinicization of Marxism during the socialist construction period. Similar to the "Great Leap Forward," although the movement towards the People's Communes had a distinct "Chinese" character, its content and methods were detached from the actual conditions in China and from the inherent requirements of modernizing Marxism. As Deng Xiaoping said, the fundamental reason for this was that "we did not have a completely clear understanding of what socialism and Marxism mean."

Chapter 7 Deepening Understanding of Socialism through Initial Rectification of "Left" Mistakes
I. Profound Reflection during the Nine-Month Rectification of "Left" Mistakes
1. Mao Zedong leads the correction of the "left" error
The serious consequences caused by the Great Leap Forward and the movement towards the people's communes became apparent in the autumn and winter of 1958. Mao Zedong was an active advocate and promoter of the Great Leap Forward and the movement towards the people's communes, but he was also one of the early leaders of the Party Central Committee who, through investigation and research, became aware of the serious problems that had arisen in these movements and took effective measures to correct the errors. From November 1958 to July of the following year, under Mao Zedong's leadership and promotion, the Party Central Committee held a series of meetings: the first Zhengzhou Conference (November 1958), the Wuhan Conference and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee (November, December 1958), the second Zhengzhou Conference (February and March 1959), the Shanghai Conference and the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee (March and April 1959), and the preliminary phase of the Lushan Conference (July 1959). These meetings calmly analyzed the situation, summarized the experience, and began to correct the "left" errors that had been identified. At these meetings, Mao Zedong led the criticism of impulsive emotions, advocated "deflating" the situation, called for cooling down, and thus calmed the minds of the participants to varying degrees. Active discussions were carried out to study measures, adjust certain policy indicators, and preliminary steps were taken to contain the chaotic situation caused by the Great Leap Forward and the movement towards the people's communes. Objectively speaking, the process of rectifying the "left" errors could not but be a process of rethinking the actual situation in China, the socialist theory of classical Marxist writers, and the Marxist theory of socialism interpreted by Stalin and the Soviet Union. These were all issues that had to be addressed in the process of Chinese Marxism becoming localized. Therefore, the process of rectifying the "left" errors was also a process of advancing the localization of Marxist theory in a tortuous manner.
At the end of 1958, Mao Zedong found that many people in the movement towards the people's communes had a lot of chaotic thinking, and there was a trend to quickly announce the establishment of public ownership by the whole people, abolishing commerce and eliminating commodity production, which had already caused serious consequences in practical work. He admitted at the Second Zhengzhou Conference that starting from September 1958, there was a "great adventurous error", and the "main error within the Party was still 'left' ". He expressed his willingness to take responsibility for the mistakes, saying that "the Central Committee doesn't have to speak, but I can speak. Once I speak, I have no burden." He hoped to persuade those comrades who had hot-headed thinking to calm down. After several meetings, discussions, and preparations, the Resolution on Several Issues concerning the People's Communes was adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee held at the end of November until early December 1958. In the resolution, while highly praising the people's communes, it was pointed out that the boundaries between collective ownership and public ownership should not be blurred, nor should the boundaries between socialism and communism be blurred; the people's communes are still essentially economic organizations of collective ownership, the transformation from agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes does not mean a transformation from collective ownership to public ownership, nor does it mean a transformation from socialism to communism; attempting to prematurely negate the principle of distribution according to work and replace it with distribution according to needs, entering communism forcibly when the conditions are not mature, is an impossible and unrealistic idea; rushing the transition can only foster the tendencies of petty bourgeois egalitarianism, and is not conducive to socialist construction, and so on.
In response to the erroneous tendency to prematurely cancel the production and exchange of goods, the "Resolution" points out that in the necessary period ahead, the commodity production of the people's communes must have significant development, as well as the exchange of goods between the state and communes, and between communes. This commodity production and exchange are conducted on the basis of socialist public ownership, not capitalism. Continuing the development of commodity production and maintaining the principle of distribution according to labor are two major principle issues for the development of the socialist economy, which must be universally recognized by the whole Party.
2. Resolving the issues of internal ownership and distribution within the communes
After rectifying the trend of eagerly transitioning to public ownership and communism in the people's communes, Mao Zedong tackles the problems of internal ownership and distribution within the communes to further correct the "communist" trend. At the second Zhengzhou Conference, he emphasizes that the main problem of the people's communes lies in our progress in improving the production relations, specifically in terms of communal ownership. There needs to be a developmental process even in understanding communal ownership. Upon its establishment, the communes abolished the production team's ownership and implemented complete communal ownership with the policy of "equalization of work points, equalization of production shares, and collection of payments." This caused great panic among the farmers, and it is the fundamental reason for the tense relationship between us and the farmers. He emphasizes that the tendency towards egalitarianism denies the necessity of differentiating the income of each production team and individual, and thus denies the socialist principle of distribution according to labor. The tendency towards excessive centralization negates the ownership of the production team. Both of these tendencies contain ideas that deny the law of value and equal exchange. Equal exchange is an inviolable economic law during the socialist period, and violating it means gratuitously taking possession of others' labor results. We do not even adopt the method of gratuitously depriving the national bourgeoisie of their labor results, so how can we gratuitously take possession of the farmers' labor results? He emphasizes that only by keeping accounts can we implement the objective law of value, which is a great school. Only through utilizing it can we possibly teach tens of millions of cadres and hundreds of millions of people to build socialism. During the conference, Mao Zedong further points out in his speeches and comments that this is the "spirit of 'left' adventurism," and believes that the main thrust within the Party should still be directed against the "left". It is commendable that such understanding has been achieved in a few short months on several fundamental issues related to socialist economic construction, persisting and developing Marxism.
Mao Zedong's opinions were accepted by senior party cadres. In the two documents formulated at the Second Zhengzhou Conference and the Shanghai Conference, titled "Several Provisions on the Management System of the People's Commune (Draft)" and "Eighteen Questions on the People's Commune," respectively, it was stipulated that the production team (in some places called the production brigade, roughly equivalent to the scope of the original advanced commune) is the basic accounting unit of the people's commune, and the ownership of the production team is still the main foundation of the commune. The production team below, referred to as the production squad (in some places called the production team, roughly equivalent to the original primary commune), as a contracted production unit, should also have partial ownership and management authority. As a general rule, the old accounts of equalization of goods and materials during the process of collectivization, which were previously not counted, would now generally be counted. All the labor, capital, and personal property of the production team mobilized by the county commune and the personal property of the commune members mobilized by the commune team must be cleared, returned in full, or compensated at a discounted price. In an urgent directive issued by the central government in May and June 1959, it was stipulated that rural areas should resume private plots, allow commune members to raise livestock and poultry, encourage them to make full use of the scattered idle land near houses and roads to grow crops and trees, exempt them from grain requisition, and exempt their produce from communal ownership. The central government also explicitly pointed out that this small private ownership within the collective was necessary for a long period of time; allowing this small private ownership was in fact protecting the fruits of the members' labor outside of collective work time, and not "developing capitalism."
In the past nine months, in addition to a series of significant adjustments in production relations, the central government also made some reductions in the high targets that were fundamentally impossible to achieve during the peak of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Although these reductions did not solve the problem of high targets and often failed to be effectively implemented in practical work. 
Of course, the correction of "leftist" deviations over the past nine months was not carried out on the basis of completely abandoning the guiding ideology of the "left." Mao Zedong did not believe that the fundamental guiding ideology was wrong. In his view, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune were entirely correct, and that was the "line, the spirit." He suggested adopting a low-key approach, "compressing the air," and only making adjustments to the targets, "solving the problem of working methods," in order to make further progress, etc. With this understanding as the basis, the correction of "leftist" deviations inevitably had many limitations and could not avoid twists and turns and reversals. It should be noted, in particular, that this relatively short period of history was an important stage in the process of Marxist Sinicization in New China. The positive and negative experiences and lessons in it provide a particular perspective and have significant implications for our understanding of the basic characteristics and laws of Marxist Sinicization under socialist conditions.
Ⅱ. Correcting the mindset through investigation and research

The most important theoretical quality of Marxism is the respect for the authority of practice, insisting on starting from reality and seeking truth from facts. In-depth practical investigation and research and a correct grasp of the national situation are the basic requirements for the sinicization of Marxism. Throughout the process of rectifying the "Left" in the past nine months, there is a prominent phenomenon that has been consistent, which is that central leaders such as Mao Zedong have eagerly delved into practical matters, conducted investigations and research, and actually started a new round of understanding the national situation. This serves as a guide to correct the errors of leftism.
If the "Great Leap Forward" and the movement towards People's Communes were characterized by a departure from the national conditions and accompanied by serious exaggeration and other problems, then the efforts to correct the "Left" deviation were closely linked to in-depth practical investigation and research from the beginning. Just like during the period of democratic revolution, when the advocacy of investigation and research was encouraged to oppose doctrinairism, Mao Zedong once again deeply immersed himself in practice, conducting investigation and research starting from October 1958. For nearly nine months, Mao Zedong went on three inspection tours starting from mid-October 1958, visiting Henan, Hubei, twice to Hebei, and once to Shandong, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other places, spending a total of over four months inspecting and holding meetings in other areas. In addition, he also sent his staff to conduct research at the grassroots level, offering them specific and detailed guidance, hoping that they could provide some authentic and reliable information about grassroots situations. It was these in-depth investigations that provided him with a more accurate understanding of the problems occurring at the grassroots level and their causes.
In the days preceding the first Zhengzhou Conference, in order to clarify the real situation, Mao Zedong conducted an inspection tour from October 13th to 17th. During these days, he had multiple conversations and meetings with the party secretaries of Tianjin, Hebei, Baoding, Tang County, Zhengding, Xushui, and Anguo. From the 19th to the 29th, he telegraphed and wrote to Chen Boda and others, providing specific instructions on the content and methods of their investigation and research in several communes in Henan, and asked them to "practice methods and attitudes for conducting investigations with the laboring people, be good at observing and raising questions," and to report back to him. On the 26th, he sent Wu Lengxi and Tian Jiaying to conduct investigations in Xiuwu and Qiliying, respectively. On October 31st, he traveled south by special train through Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Xinxiang, conversing with the responsible comrades of the provincial, regional, municipal, and county committees in each place, conducting investigation and research. After the Zhengzhou Conference, from November 11th to 20th, he continued his investigation and research in Henan and Hebei, respectively, holding talks with cadres at the provincial, regional, county, and commune levels, as well as with relevant leaders from the central government and cadres delegated to the central agencies, to understand the situation in various aspects. After the 8th Plenum of the 6th Party Central Committee at the end of November, he continued his in-depth investigation by extensively conversing with local responsible comrades in Hubei, Hunan, and on his return to Beijing. From February 23rd to 26th, 1959, while en route to the second Zhengzhou Conference, he had separate conversations with responsible comrades from Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan provinces, regions, and municipalities.
After extensive and in-depth investigation, his thinking gradually approached reality. At the first Zhengzhou Conference, he proposed distinguishing between two types of public ownership and advocated for the adherence to equal exchange, criticizing the tendency to hastily cancel commodity production and to "rush forward recklessly." At the Wuhan Conference, he said, "In our country, some people are a bit too enthusiastic at the moment." He also said, "We have made things too big now, and I think it's unrealistic. I ask that we adopt a low profile and compress our thinking." He admitted that he had made mistakes in being hasty and had suffered real adversity due to the pursuit of empty accolades. He even expressed: "In the past, others criticized me for reckless advance, now I am criticizing others for reckless advance." Based on his opinions, the Resolution on Several Questions in the People's Communes that was passed at the 6th Plenum emphasized the need to distinguish between collective ownership and public ownership, as well as the boundaries between socialism and communism. It emphasized that "continuing to develop commodity production and maintaining the principle of distribution according to work are two major issues for the development of the socialist economy."
In the early months of 1959, Mao Zedong's mind further cooled down. In January, he stated in a conversation that he needed to observe whether the general line was correct or not. In February, he said, "We are still children when it comes to economic construction," and "we should admit this: we do not understand, we do not know how to wage war against the earth, against nature." At the Second Zhengzhou Conference, he pointed out that the "Communist winds" that arose after the establishment of communes had caused great panic among farmers, and that there was a considerable state of tension between us and the farmers on some issues. The reason behind this was that we did not adhere to the principle of value, and we had gone a bit too far on the issue of communal ownership. These analyses clarified some confusion and accurately grasped the crux of the People's Commune system. According to his requirements, the conference established the guidelines for rectifying and constructing the People's Communes, and produced the important minutes of the "Zhengzhou Conference." After the Second Zhengzhou Conference, he further made suggestions on several major policy issues, such as whether the basic accounting units should be placed at the large brigades or teams, whether the old accounts should be calculated, and whether the small teams should have partial ownership. This effectively caused the basic ownership of the communes to regress to the scale of the previous advanced or partially primary cooperatives.
From mid-October 1958 (less than five months after the launch of the "Great Leap Forward") to the beginning of 1959, Mao Zedong remained restless, constantly travelling, and conducting investigations and research. Based on this, after the Second Zhengzhou Conference, the Wuhan Conference, the Sixth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the Shanghai Conference, and the Seventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, he finally took a step towards rectifying the "left" deviations and brought the party's policy back to reality. This transformation was the result of Mao Zedong and the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee directly immersing themselves in practical work, conducting investigations and research, listening to the voice of the masses, and deepening their understanding of the national conditions. It injected strong impetus into the progress of the Sinicization of Marxism during this period. This bears many similarities to the massive investigative research conducted by the entire party in the early 1960s.
2. The Premise of Investigative Research
In-depth investigation and research are the premise and foundation for rectifying "left" mistakes. However, when rectifying the "left" mistakes, was there no investigation conducted? Not true. During the "Great Leap Forward" and the process of the People's Commune Movement, Mao Zedong also conducted in-depth visits to factories and rural areas to understand the situation on the ground. He repeatedly emphasized that the central and provincial-level leaders should spend several months each year outside of their offices, appear in the posture of ordinary workers, treat the masses with an equal attitude, and truly understand the real situation. However, this kind of investigation did not ensure that Mao Zedong understood the real situation. On the contrary, it led him to conclusions and determination such as surpassing Britain in "only taking two to three years, two years is possible" (June 22, 1958), "when there is plenty of food, we can implement the supply system and not charge for meals" (August 1958), and "just double the steel production, why bother with delays" (August 1958). It can be seen that it is not enough to promote or conduct investigations in order to understand the national situation and lay the practical foundation for Marxist sinicization in China. Without investigation, there is no right to speak. Only through investigation and research can we accurately grasp the national situation. This is true in terms of general principles, principles, and methods. However, in a specific historical period or for a specific individual, investigation and research may not necessarily be able to understand the national situation. The reason for the "failure of investigation" is not only limited by subjective and objective conditions such as the degree of development of things, the exposure of problems, and the amount of accumulated experience, but also constrained by other factors. For example, starting from strong subjective desires, starting from some dogmatic or empirical formulas, attaching more importance to facts or opinions that conform to one's own views, and hoping that investigations will confirm existing knowledge; unable to accept conclusions obtained through other people's investigations that are different from one's own, etc. In addition, there are some deeper reasons that cannot be avoided. For example, just after experiencing the expansion of the anti-rightist movement, under the background of the escalating criticism of "anti-adventurism" such as Zhou Enlai, etc., the expansion of class struggle has seriously harmed democracy within and outside the party, and the party's "one-voice system" has begun to form. Even telling the truth has become a "scarce resource", and it requires the chairman of the party central committee to personally call for telling the truth. How can the quality of the investigation be guaranteed? Who determines the correctness of the investigation results? For example, whether it is the nine-month rectification of "left" mistakes or the large-scale investigation and research conducted by the whole party in 1961, they were carried out on the premise that Mao Zedong had some understanding of and a less rigid attitude towards the "left" mistakes. But what if his attitude does not change? These are questions that must be deeply pondered. 
It can be said that under the condition that the party has already come to power, the important issue is often not whether to conduct investigation and research or not, but whether we can conduct scientific and effective investigation and research, and whether we can realize the subjective well-intentioned wishes in a practical manner. In order to truly achieve this good intention and effectively grasp the reality of China, there are also some important conditions beyond investigation and research. 
The third question is: what kind of Marxist guidance is used in practice.
1. The reading and what books to read
Apart from investigation and research, another fundamental element of the Sinicization of Marxism is adhering to the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and methodology. In socialist countries, within the proletarian party, there is no doubt or dispute about this. However, following this issue, another equally important question arises, which is to adhere to what kind of Marxism or, in other words, how to ensure that the understanding, grasp, and application of Marxism is correct. To solve this problem, apart from other conditions, special attention must be paid to the contemporary characteristics of Marxism mentioned here. Just like how "On New Democracy" became a successful example of Sinicization because Mao Zedong used a "contemporary" Marxist perspective to grasp the characteristics of China. Without this, the task of Sinicization cannot be implemented.
During the process of rectifying "left" tendencies in the past nine months, besides a series of practical and effective investigations and research, there was also a prominent phenomenon. After initiating the initial rectification of "left" tendencies at the end of 1958, Mao Zedong more urgently demanded party cadres to "read" in a series of important meetings, "to gain a clear understanding for themselves, in order to guide our great economic work". He believed that during the Great Leap Forward and People's Commune period, reading this type of books would be most interesting and could clarify a lot of confused thinking. At the beginning of the Lu Shan Conference in 1959, among the 19 agenda items proposed by Mao Zedong, the first item was about reading. On July 2nd, he said during the opening ceremony: Considering that many leading comrades still have limited understanding of socialist economic issues and do not understand the laws of economic development, and considering that there is still pragmatism in our current work, we should study hard, "Last year we had a year of practice, it's even better to read this year".
There is one more point worth noting. Mao Zedong particularly emphasized the content that party cadres at all levels should study at this time, which are three important works: "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union," "Communist Society According to Marx, Engels, and Lenin," and "Political Economy of Socialism in the Soviet Union" (textbook). This is in contrast to his repeated emphasis on rejecting superstition, liberating thought, and overthrowing dogmatism during the "Great Leap Forward" movement and his repeated recommendation of reading "Communist Society According to Marx, Engels, and Lenin." The change in reading materials directly reflects the ideological shift from the "left" to the correction of the "left," reflecting the use of Marxism to guide practice and the attitude toward Marxism.
2. Implementing the General Line of the Transitional Period and Studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"
As described in Chapter 3, in 1953, the party put forward the general line of the transitional period, transitioning from the implementation of the outline for the new democratic revolution to the socialist transformation and the "First Five-Year Plan" construction with the Soviet model as the standard and goal. Under the call of the Party Central Committee, a climax of studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" (Chapters 9 to 12) and other works such as "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union" was set off throughout the party. The "Brief Guide to the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" written in 1938 discusses in a relatively systematic way the history and experience of Soviet Communist Party's leadership in the restoration of the national economy, industrialization, and agricultural collectivization, emphasizing the significance of prioritizing heavy industry development for achieving socialist industrialization. It is a classic systematic summary of the Stalinist model. In the "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union" published in 1952, Stalin systematically discusses some basic laws of socialist economic work based on the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. Although these understandings are inevitably limited by the times, they have made some progress compared to the Soviet model in the 1930s and the relevant discussions in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." They should be regarded as an important achievement in the process of modernizing Marxism and were highly praised by Chinese Communists at that time. "The works left to us by Stalin, such as 'Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union' and 'Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,' creatively enriched and developed Marxism, giving us new, incredibly sharp theoretical weapons." "We must work harder to study Stalin's theories" and "truly become good students of Stalin." In the early stages of industrialization, the basic theories we followed in theory were essentially Stalin's theories, as Mao Zedong said, "The direction is one, the content is one."
Starting from 1956, with the completion of the three major transformations and especially after the Soviet Union's 20th Congress and the subsequent Hungarian Revolution, Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly felt the drawbacks of the Soviet model and the need to reform it. They proposed to act according to actual conditions, not being constrained by the established practices of the Soviet Union, and to embark on a path of socialist construction that was unique to China. By the time he wrote "On the Ten Major Relationships," the idea of "taking the Soviet Union as a lesson" became even more clear. Mao Zedong emphasized, "In the past, we learned from their experiences and avoided some detours. Now, of course, we must be even more vigilant." "What we need to learn is what belongs to universal truth and learning must be combined with the concrete conditions of China. If every word, including those of Marx, is taken absolutely, that would be terrible. Our theory is a combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practices of the Chinese revolution." He later said, "In the first eight years, we just copied foreign experiences. But starting from 1956 when we put forward the ten major relationships, we began to find our own path that is suitable for China." However, discovering the limitations of the Soviet model and opposing dogmatism based on Soviet experiences was just the first step in exploring the correct path. Whether a correct path suitable for China could be found still depended on how to take the second step correctly.
3. Initiating the "Great Leap Forward" and studying "On the Critique of the Communist Manifesto" by Marx, Engels, and Lenin
During the process of brewing and initiating the "Great Leap Forward," Mao Zedong repeatedly criticized right-wing conservatism and emphasized the need to eliminate superstition. He advocated against dogmatism and blind adherence to Soviet models in studying. The main theme of his speeches at the Second Session of the Eighth Party Congress was to eliminate superstition, emancipate the mind, and have the courage to think, speak, and act. He believed that many things we do and practice surpass Marx, so all superstitions must be shattered, and we should not fear professors or fear Marx. He believed that after the rectification movement and the victory on the political and ideological fronts in the "anti-rightist" campaign, there would inevitably be a climax in economic construction. The "Great Leap Forward" and the movement to establish People's Communes were attempts to break through the Soviet model in terms of construction speed and the transitional period. In this context, "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" seemed to have been somewhat neglected because its main contents (such as commodities, law of value, planned development, proportional development, and the principles of "technology determines everything" and "cadres determine everything" - these were precisely the developments of classical theory based on practice) could not provide theoretical basis for the more extreme actions of the "Great Leap Forward" and People's Communes.
Under the encouragement of emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions, faced with the ever-growing momentum of the Great Leap Forward and the urgent transition wave, Lenin's New Economic Policy did not align with reality, and the Stalinist model with defects such as "one big two public" and "hastening the transition" was also being questioned. It seemed that China suddenly found itself in a state of "model vacuum" or "theory vacuum". Against the backdrop of the simplified and idealized understanding of socialism and communism in socialist countries at that time, and inspired by the experiences of the war years, the early descriptions of future society by classical writers resonated greatly within the Party leadership. In March 1958, Mao Zedong said in a conversation that the combination of rural and social organizations was the embryo of communism, managing everything, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military. In April 1958, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and others discussed the new rural grassroots organizational structure, mentioning communes, utopianism, speculative socialism, and the transition to communism, and called for the compilation of two books, "Speculative Socialism" and "Marx-Engels on Communist Society". In June, "Marx-Engels on Communist Society" was completed. The first sentence of the preface of this book states: "In our socialist construction, which is in the situation of 'one day equals twenty years' Great Leap Forward, people cannot but be concerned about how our country will gradually transition from socialism to a communist society." Some early descriptions of communist society compiled in this book became the theoretical basis and spiritual driving force for the haste to transition and the concepts of "one big two public". For example, the first quoted passage in the book is from Engels' speech in Eichsfeld in 1845, in which he mentioned the grassroots organization of communist society called commune in two places. Similar discussions seem to have played a significant role in Mao Zedong's final decision to call the newly merged large collectives "people's communes". Similarly, the adoption of Marx's earlier discussions on "the bourgeois right" as a justification for implementing supply system and narrowing or even eliminating various differences; the adoption of classical writers' arguments about the revolutionary period being equivalent to "one day equals twenty years" as a basis for estimating the rate of development of productive forces in the socialist period; the argument that many things discussed by classical writers were first implemented in the military, serving as the basis for the militarized management of people's communes, and so on. In August, at the Beidaihe conference that launched the movement to transform people's communes, Mao Zedong recommended this book to the conference, calling for its public publication and wide dissemination "in order to provide theoretical basis for the transition to communism." He believed that this book was very enlightening for us, but also quite insufficient, because many words were vague impressions, as there was no experience at that time. When it was determined that "the realization of communism in our country is no longer a distant future," it seemed natural to call for the study of such a book. 
Amidst a climate against doctrinairism and haste to transition, directly applying certain early statements of classical writers without considering the significant differences and changes in the times and national conditions is essentially replacing the doctrinairism of classical writers with the doctrinairism of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Stalin's Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, and using some more traditional conclusions as the basis to surpass and replace the somewhat outdated Soviet model, thus seeking theoretical basis for extreme practices such as the "Great Leap Forward". From the perspective of the history of Marxist development, the process of launching the "Great Leap Forward" and the movement towards people's communes is a process of using doctrinairism as an intermediary and replacing contemporaneity with traditionalism.
4. Two books studied intensively during the nine-month anti-"Left" struggle.
After the rectification movement started in November 1958, Mao Zedong's focus on reading materials changed significantly from the previous few months of advocating for reading communist literature. During the preparation and convening of the first Zhengzhou Conference, he carefully studied and repeatedly called on the entire party to seriously study Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR". "We can still refer to Stalin's book 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR' for studying the nature of communes, exchange, the transition from socialism to communism, and the transition from collective ownership to national ownership." "Now we see things differently from when it was published. At the time of publication, we didn't think about these issues."
On November 9th, in order to clarify the ideological confusion during the "Great Leap Forward", Mao Zedong, in his famous "Suggestions on Reading", requested that members of the central, provincial, municipal, autonomous region, prefecture, and county party committees read Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and "On the Communist Society" by Marx, Engels, and Lenin three times each. If there is time in the future, they can also read the "Political Economy Textbook of the Soviet Union". "Read these two books with a focus on connecting them with the socialist economic revolution and economic construction in China, so as to gain a clear mind and guide our great economic work. Many people now have a lot of confused thoughts, and reading these two books may help clarify them." "During the 'Great Leap Forward' and the period of the people's communes, reading these types of books is most interesting."
On November 9th and 10th, Mao Zedong explained the first, second, and third chapters of this book to all comrades attending the first Zhengzhou Conference, saying, "In the past, I was not interested, but now it's different. There are many noteworthy things in these three chapters." He also said, "The book should be read from beginning to end, chapter by chapter, and discussed." He emphasized the second chapter on "the problem of the commodity economy" and "attempted to persuade some comrades by quoting Stalin." In response to the widespread abandonment of commodity production and haste to transition during the "Great Leap Forward," he repeatedly quoted and interpreted Stalin's discussions on commodities, emphasizing, "We must affirm the positive role of socialist commodity production and exchange" and pointing out, "Commodity production should not be confused with capitalism. Why are people afraid of commodity production?" He also repeatedly criticized the tendency to blur the boundary between collective ownership and national ownership. On November 13th, he suggested discussing the first, second, and third chapters of the "Opinions on the Soviet Economic Problem" section by Stalin, "to prepare for the Wuhan Conference (expanded meeting of the Politburo) in advance." At the Party's Sixth Plenum, he called on everyone to "study economic theory issues in connection with the actual work" and stated that "at present, studying this issue has great theoretical and practical significance for our cause."
This intense and in-depth reading experience had a significant impact on Mao Zedong. During the first Zhengzhou Conference, while revising the important documents "Forty Articles on the Socialist Construction Outline (1958-1972)" and "Decisions on Several Issues of the People's Communes at the Zhengzhou Conference," Mao's understanding of what socialism is, what it means to build socialism, and the two types of socialist ownership relations, largely reflected the thinking of "The Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union." In response to the trend of underestimating planning and balance during the "Great Leap Forward," Mao referred to Stalin's proposed "objective law of planned economic development" as the "objective law" and asked, "Have we studied, mastered, and become proficient in the application of this objective law? Does our plan fully reflect this objective law?"
Different from the discussions on communism by classical authors, "The Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union" was written based on a certain practice of socialist construction, which made several important developments to the traditional views of the 1930s. Although it still belongs to the overall traditional socialist model, its discussions on socialist economy have far exceeded the general description of future society by classical authors. Just as blindly copying certain discussions in "Marx-Engels on the Communist Society" became a theoretical weapon for eager transition, this book by Stalin became an important theoretical weapon for Mao to correct "left" mistakes and unify the Party's thinking, which is "using the dead Stalin to suppress the living." The change in the focus of Mao's reading reflects, from one aspect, the trend of returning to the traditional Stalinist model from extreme behaviors such as the "Great Leap Forward," and also reflects the desire to replace the traditional Marxism with relatively contemporary Marxism by careful selection.
In the first half of 1959, with the deepening of correcting "left" mistakes, Mao shifted the focus of his study to the study of the third edition (Volume II) of the Soviet Union's "Political Economy Textbook." Prior to this, on November 20, 1958, Mao proposed to publish as a conference document the important modifications and supplements to the third edition of the Soviet Union's "Political Economy Textbook" collated by the Economic Department of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and published in the internal journal of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee. The next day, he again proposed "to read the Political Economy Textbook" and "first read the socialist part." In June 1959, he instructed for the textbook to be printed in large print and distributed to central and provincial leaders. On July 2nd, at a meeting convened with some central leaders and heads of collaboration areas, Mao said that since many leading comrades last year had little understanding of socialist economic issues and did not understand the laws of economic development, and because there is still bureaucracy in the current work, it is necessary to study hard. "Members at the level of the Central Committee, provincial, city, and county committees, including county party secretaries, should read the Soviet Union's 'Political Economy Textbook' (third edition)." On the 3rd, Mao listed "reading" in the "Lu Mountain Conference's discussion topics" as the first item. "Senior cadres should read Volume II of the 'Political Economy Textbook.' The readers' scope should include members of the Central Committee down to county party secretaries." On August 15, Mao suggested that central leaders also read the Soviet Union's "Philosophical Dictionary" (third edition) and the third edition of the "Political Economy Textbook." Mao hoped that Party cadres at all levels would combine the practice of the "Great Leap Forward," study the economic theory of Soviet socialism in the 1950s, carefully summarize their experiences, and correct "left" mistakes. Although there was a reversal from correcting "left" mistakes to opposing right deviation at the Lu Mountain Conference, from the winter of 1959 to the beginning of 1960, central leaders including Liu Shaoqi, Mao Zedong, and Zhou Enlai formed study groups and thoroughly read Volume II of the third edition of the "Political Economy Textbook," resulting in several important study discussions.
The third edition of the textbook "Political Economy" published in October 1958 still belonged to the Stalinist model overall, but it also reflected to some extent the initial reforms in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death, and a deepening understanding of the question of "what is socialism". Compared to the first edition of the textbook, which was based on Stalin's "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union", it underwent more revisions, with the most additions and modifications made to the section on socialist modes of production. It introduced new expressions in the areas of the basic laws of socialist economics, the planned and proportional development of the national economy, commodity production and the law of value, as well as material incentives. For example, when discussing the necessity of commodity production under socialist conditions, the third edition highlighted the inevitable use of the commodity form for product exchange between different owners. In contrast to the viewpoint of the previous editions, which held that the circulation of means of production within state ownership was not commodity production, the third edition considered this circulation to still be commodity production, even though it did not change ownership. Regarding the law of value under socialist conditions, the first and second editions mainly discussed it from a restrictive perspective, while the third edition mainly discussed it from the perspective of utilization. In terms of economic accounting, the third edition particularly emphasized its importance for collective farms, which was not present in the previous editions. The principles of "material incentives" and "distribution according to labor" were also given greater emphasis in the third edition, in clear contrast to the previous two editions. Furthermore, unlike the first and second editions, the third edition placed greater emphasis on the role of the law of value and material interests under socialist conditions. These new viewpoints were based on new practices and reflected a deepening understanding of socialist issues. They should also be considered as efforts and achievements in the contemporary development of Marxism. In fact, since Stalin's death, we have gradually faced two Soviet models: one is the Soviet model that ended in 1953, represented by the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and especially "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union"; the other is the Soviet model that has been continuously revised and reformed since then, represented by the first edition of the textbook.
5. Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi's Discussions on the Soviet Union's "Political Economy" Textbook
Mao Zedong's discussions on the textbook covered various aspects including economics, philosophy, politics, history, and international relations. He interpreted and expounded on some viewpoints in the textbook based on his own experiences and understanding, especially after the erroneous criticism of Peng Dehuai at the Lu Shan Conference. He accepted some viewpoints in the textbook, strengthened some of them, and negated others. Among them, there were new understandings of the laws of socialist construction, as well as the adherence and even development of traditional Stalinist models. Some of his assertions in the discussions broke through the traditional perspectives. For example, in terms of understanding the historical stage of socialism, Mao Zedong believed that socialism could and should be divided into stages. In particular, he put forward the viewpoints of "underdeveloped socialism" and "comparatively developed socialism", which made a new and methodologically significant contribution to the theory of socialist stages at that time, deepening the understanding of the long-term nature of socialism. Regarding the goal of China's socialist modernization, he proposed that "constructing socialism originally required modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture, now it must also include modernization of national defense", and emphasized the need for China to establish an independent and complete industrial system. In response to the eagerness to transition to communism at that time, he emphasized that completing socialist construction in China was a challenging task and should not be rushed. He proposed implementing several simultaneous measures under the conditions of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. In response to the confusion in commodity economy that occurred since the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong pointed out that those who advocated the abolition of commodities and the eradication of commodity production failed to distinguish the essential difference between commodity production under socialism and commodity production under capitalism, and failed to understand the importance of utilizing commodity production under the socialist system. He also believed that means of production could also become commodities. He agreed with Stalin's viewpoint that commodity production is connected to certain economic conditions. He emphasized the direct management of the state by the laborers and the achievement of equality between laborers and managers, as well as between cadres and the masses. He also expressed agreement with the main viewpoints in the book on socialist economic laws, the speed of industrialization, the commodity economy, and so on.
On the other hand, some of the conversations reflect his lingering enthusiasm for the "Great Leap Forward". For example: he still insists on highly praising the "one big and two publics" of people's communes, believing that it is the best form of transition to communism; he believes that household responsibility system is the resistance of some wealthy middle peasants to collectivization; he is dissatisfied with the third edition of textbooks changing "Great Leap Forward" to "great development", and hopes to find evidence in textbooks that is beneficial to the "Great Leap Forward" and the collectivization movement of people's communes; he appreciates the idea that "poverty is a driving force" and believes that it is not good to become wealthy; he agrees with the textbook's view that socialism is not an independent and fixed socio-economic form, but is transitioning to communism; he talks more about the necessity of transition, but actually, like other socialist countries at the time, he did not realize the long-term nature of the socialist stage; regarding the driving force of socialist development, he criticizes the textbook several times for not recognizing that social contradictions are the driving force of socialist development, but he appreciates the view in the textbook that the main contradiction during the transitional period is between socialism and capitalism; he highly praises the past planned economy system, criticizing the textbook for focusing too much on material interests; he criticizes the textbook for exaggerating the role of the law of value, and believes that the law of value should not be the main basis for planning work, because "the Great Leap Forward was not based on the requirements of the law of value", and so on. These comments actually fell behind the level of "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union". Some of the content reflects his evaluation of the textbook as lower than "Socialist Economic Problems in the Soviet Union". Between the two, he tends to adhere to the traditional Stalinist model and criticizes the new viewpoints in the textbook. This became more apparent when he read books more systematically after the Lushan Conference. He believes that the textbook "has serious flaws and principle errors", "deleted some good things from Stalin and added a lot of bad things from the 20th Party Congress, which is a big step backward"; "it can be said that it is a Marxist book with serious errors". In particular, his criticism of material incentives throughout the speech reflects his attitude towards the reform of socialist countries at that time. "In this book, some basic perspectives are wrong. The book does not emphasize the principle of political leadership and the mass line, does not talk about pursuing two goals at once, and unilaterally emphasizes personal material interests and promotes material incentives." These viewpoints, which often appeared in embryonic form while studying textbooks, further developed during the broadening of class struggle and the anti-revisionist struggle in the 1960s, and developed into a complete theoretical form in the "theoretical directive" of 1975.
In his speech on reading textbooks, Liu Shaoqi also expressed some important opinions. Among them, many of his views are similar to those of Mao Zedong, but he also has many important and unique insights. For example, regarding the driving force of socialist development, his views largely maintain some of the correct conclusions of the Eighth Party Congress resolution. He believes that the contradictions between socialism and capitalism are still intense, but will gradually decrease in the future, "the contradiction between production and needs (including production and life) promotes social development." Regarding the issue of proletarian dictatorship, he believes that from the trend of development of the functions of the state, the role of dictatorship internally is becoming smaller, "but the function of organizing and educating the masses will exist for ten thousand years." On the issue of ownership, he suggests paying attention to resolving internal contradictions within ownership, "under socialist public ownership, there is still much room for improvement, continuously adjusting internal relationships can promote better development of productive forces." On the issue of distribution according to work, he believes that "material incentives are still necessary, but reliance solely on material incentives is not enough", and so on.
From imitating the Soviet model in 1953 to breaking through the Soviet model and finding our own path in 1956, to returning to the classics during the "Great Leap Forward," to re-reading "The Problems of Socialism in the Soviet Union" during the rectification of "left" errors and returning to the Stalinist model, to the choices and judgments made when reading the third edition of textbooks - from this specific perspective of reading, it reflects to some extent the choices made by Mao Zedong and other central leaders in a relatively short period of time, experiencing the selection of three models (classic model, Stalinist model, and the Soviet model with some reform characteristics - although the differences between the latter two are not significant), experiencing the affirmation-breakthrough-return process of the Stalinist model. Although it seems complicated in form, when examining its relationship with the traditional model, what we touch upon is only the branches and leaves, while the trunk remains untouched or cannot be touched. As Mao Zedong said, the principles are the same as the Soviet Union, but the methods are different. Between the two Soviet models, we are more inclined towards the original Stalinist model; between traditional Marxism and Marxism in the process of contemporaryization, we seem to lean more towards the former. Practices such as the "Great Leap Forward" appear to be a breakthrough from the Soviet model but are actually a regression compared to the original model - especially in relation to the ongoing reforms. 
Whether it is launching the "Great Leap Forward" or the rectification of "left" errors for nearly nine months, they are all guided by the call and action of studying Marxism. However, practice has proven that mere general calls or general study of Marxism are far from enough and are prone to dogmatism, pragmatism, and formalism. What is more important is how we treat Marxism and how we advance the contemporaryization of Marxism in line with the times, and how we combine this contemporary Marxist approach with the reality of China, thus achieving the Sinicization of Marxism in new historical conditions. 
IV. Democratization and the Sinicization of Marxism
1. The Interruption and Reversal of the Democratization Process and the Anti-"Left" Turn
In the late part of July 1959, the promising efforts to rectify the "Leftist" tendencies abruptly came to a halt during the second half of the Lushan Conference. Subsequently, the "anti-rightist" movement not only brought about severe consequences in politics and the economy but also dealt a blow to the progress of the Marxist Chinese transformation that had just started to show some improvement during the nine-month rectification of the "Leftist" tendencies. The long-lasting attention given to this reversal is due to the fact that it coincided with a time when there was a certain level of recognition of the mistakes made during the "Great Leap Forward" and the people's commune movement, a deeper understanding of the national situation, and some progress in the contemporary development of Marxism. It can be said that, as a whole, there was some development in understanding and awareness of the issues in the party, but whenever confronted with new circumstances, there was a tendency to fluctuate, as was the case during the 1950s and 1960s.
For instance, when summarizing the lessons learned from the "Great Leap Forward" in the early 1960s, Mao Zedong keenly felt that the lack of democracy within and outside the party was an important unavoidable reason. Therefore, in his speech at the Seventh Thousand Person Conference, he began by stating, "The key is to talk about the issue of democratic centralism," emphasizing the need for "ample democratic life" within and outside the party. However, this strong desire did not change the deteriorating condition of democratic life within and outside the party that followed. Another example is the May 1963 addition made by Mao Zedong in the guiding document "The First Ten Points" for the "Four Cleanups" campaign, where he emphasized that correct thinking can only come from social practice, but this did not prevent repeated incorrect assessments of the class struggle situation during the "Four Cleanups" movement. Furthermore, during the "Cultural Revolution," he repeatedly called on the entire party and the nation to study Marxist-Leninist works, but the fundamental principles of Marxism faced unprecedented distortion during this decade and so on. The reasons behind these phenomena undoubtedly include the limitations of understanding and some accidental factors, but more fundamentally, they lie in the lack of democracy within and outside the party and the defects of the national political system. Here, another fundamental element of the sinicization of Marxism is brought up - the institutional factor. Moreover, the Lushan Conference proved that under socialist conditions, the institutional factor seems to play a more significant role compared to the previous two factors.
As in the first historic leap of the Sinicization of Marxism during the period of the democratic revolution, which weakened and eventually eliminated the "blind command" of the highly centralized Comintern on China, the achievement of certain independent thinking and "democratic rights" is also a prerequisite for the Sinicization of Marxism under socialist conditions. It is inevitable for the Sinicization of Marxism to be closely related to a wide range of democratic practices within and outside the party, as well as to intellectual liberation and theoretical innovation. The "second leap" will inevitably rely more on China's democratization process. For the innovation and development of Marxism, democracy is as essential as water and air. Moreover, this democracy must be an intrinsic democracy based on relatively advanced productive forces and a market economy, rather than just a democratic style.
The failures of the Great Leap Forward movement, the people's commune movement, and the reversal at the Lu Mountain Conference were primarily the result of the destruction of the party's collective leadership principle and democratic centralism. They were setbacks in China's democratization process. When democracy became scarce, not only was it impossible to talk about the "second leap," even "speaking the truth" became rare and precious. During the process of correcting the "leftist" deviation in the past nine months, Mao Zedong increasingly realized the problem of cadres being afraid to report the situation truthfully to their superiors and express different opinions. In early April 1959, at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Party Central Committee, he called for learning from Hai Rui, who was known for speaking the truth, and even said, "Our comrades are not as brave as Hai Rui." In the same month, in his internal communication to cadres at all levels from the province to the production brigades, titled "Party Internal Communication," he emphasized the issue of speaking the truth: "Honest people, those who dare to speak the truth, ultimately benefit the cause of the people and do not harm themselves," and pointed out, "It should be said that many lies are imposed from above." After that, leaders such as Liu Shaoqi also emphasized this issue when summarizing their experiences. "In recent years, our party life and national life have greatly weakened democratic centralism and, in some places, even experienced brutal destruction." "When leaders speak, they reflect to you what you demand and what you like. This situation is probably quite common and has become a bad practice in many places." "In recent years, our party life has been abnormal. 'When meeting people, only speak three-tenths of the truth and do not fully expose your heart.' This phenomenon is very dangerous." The "Five Winds" that escalated and persisted without being cured were nothing more than external manifestations of systemic diseases that were reinforced by the expanded campaigns against right-leaning tendencies and rightists.
2. The shortcomings of the traditional system hinder the progress of the Sinicization of Marxism.
It is generally believed that the traditional Stalinist model has the following basic characteristics: a highly centralized one-party governance power structure and decision-making system; blurring of the line between party and government, and between government and enterprises, with the party and state directly managing and operating enterprises through national power and administrative orders, regulating economic operations and allocating social resources; a single public ownership structure that largely excludes market mechanisms and operates under a directive planned economy system; a massive, all-encompassing, top-down hierarchical leadership structure; an official ideology centered around Marxism, with a strong mobilization capacity, and a tightly-knit party organization, among others. In the early stage of socialist development, this emphasis on unity, obedience, uniformity, centralization, and the political and spiritual mobilization system had a strong social mobilization function and resource allocation capacity, which effectively promoted economic recovery and the development of productive forces, fulfilling the mission of the early stage of industrialization, albeit at a considerable cost.
This classic socialist system has also given rise to its own unique problems, which become more apparent under a context of lagging reforms: the blind pursuit of the degree of public ownership of the means of production has resulted in an unclear definition of property subjects, often making officials at various levels become property subjects at different levels, and the opaque origin of power has made it difficult for the rights that the people should enjoy to be given due attention; the institutional structure gives government officials at various levels a distinct advantage in decision-making processes compared to other social groups, and the leadership core at the center of the system occupies an absolute position in the decision-making system, making it difficult to avoid various forms of "one-man rule"; while the planned economy creates material wealth, it also constantly reproduces the authority of superiors over subordinates and the obedience of subordinates to superiors; the appointment system makes officials at all levels more concerned about being accountable to their superiors and their preferences and intentions, resulting in the collection and processing of information in accordance with the intentions and preferences of superiors becoming a chronic issue; the highly centralized system greatly limits the ability to reflect situations from bottom to top and the capacity for supervision, reduces the enthusiasm of the masses for participation, and although it excels at making quick decisions and implementing them effectively, it lacks timely and effective self-regulation capability and error-correction mechanisms; the scope of planning often extends beyond the economic domain and permeates into politics, ideology, and even personal life, thereby making it difficult for a society lacking vitality due to the weakening of the commodity economy to obtain "activation" from other aspects. Moreover, the inherent characteristics of centralization and hierarchy in the traditional system not only easily resonate with the hierarchical systems in some pre-capitalist societies, leading to the emergence of personality cults, but also further reinforce themselves under conditions of war threats, economic difficulties, and the escalation of class struggle.
In summary, this highly centralized and uniform system, while demonstrating its significant institutional advantages and performance, also exhibits institutional deficiencies such as low level of democracy, insufficient public participation, and lack of social vitality, which weaken the drive and capability for theoretical innovation. Just as it is unimaginable to have a decentralized political system and a pluralistic ideological system under a highly centralized planned economic system, it is also unimaginable for this kind of system to provide ample space for academic debates, independent thinking, equal discussions, and open-mindedness. Just as it is difficult to cultivate a modern concept of equality in a hierarchical system, this kind of system often cannot escape the chronic tendency of administrative power arbitrating academic debates and judging the quantity of truth based on status, thereby making theoretical innovation the monopoly and privilege of leaders and making "top-down" a mandatory requirement within the system, thus diminishing people's enthusiasm for theoretical thinking. In the traditional system, under the conditions of weakened economic leverage and shrinking commodity economy, and with economic development but lagging reforms, if erroneous judgments are made regarding class struggle during the socialist era, the subjectivity and compulsion of the system will become more prominent, and supra-economic political and administrative means will be strengthened, with the role of ideology expanding and its singularity, absoluteness, and compulsion becoming more apparent. Such institutional deficiencies severely constrain the development of Marxism at a deep level, weaken the drive for theoretical innovation, and fail to meet the necessary conditions for the localization and nationalization of Marxism. This is the deep-rooted reason why dogmatism was prevalent in socialist countries after the war, and why clichés, empty words, and formalism were rampant, making it difficult for Marxism to modernize and nationalize, and it is also the deep-rooted reason why the second leap in the sinicization of Marxism could not be achieved between 1949 and 1978.
These institutional deficiencies are not artificial; they are a regular problem that exists in the construction of socialist countries in backward nations. They can only be explained by factors such as the low level of productive forces and social development at the time of seizing power, the radical tradition of political revolutions, the severe international situation during the Cold War, and the catch-up strategy in the early stage of industrialization in backward countries. They cannot be abstractly accused without historical conditions, nor can they be subjected to moralistic criticism. Modernization history worldwide has shown that, unlike developed countries, in the launching factors of modernization process in backward nations, political, ideological, and other non-economic factors are inevitably more important than economic factors. The political system and ideology of a country play a dominant role in the early stages of development, and the state solves various problems in the early stage of industrialization through varying degrees of political and economic centralization. The choice of this political-economic system is determined by the era's conditions and the domestic environment. Generally speaking, countries that have experienced long-term revolutions or wars and have vast territories will demand a higher degree of centralization of power. The more economically backward a country is before a revolution, the more it needs strong political authority and rule in the industrialization process, and it pursues a catch-up strategy with a high speed and a priority on heavy industry.
In China, a backward Eastern country, after undergoing a fierce political revolution, relying on the socialist system and a highly centralized state power, a strong lever for promoting social and economic transformation and development, it chose to accelerate its social change and development through planned economy instead of market economy. This was the modernization "march at full speed" that began in a challenging international cold war environment. The choice of the above system has its historical inevitability and rationality, which is a historical progress. Here, there is both adherence to the traditional socialist theory and ideology, and very practical economic considerations that are not ideological. This is just like "even Western market economies realized that for economic recovery, there needs to be a strong government presence. Even countries that advocate liberalism often adopt economic policies previously labeled as 'socialist' that were led by the state." Even some active proponents of economic liberalism have become enthusiastic supporters of planned economy, although they remain enemies of socialism. Our subsequent mistakes were primarily not in choosing this model during the early years of the founding of New China, nor in failing to propose the task of reform in a timely manner, but in deviating from the right direction when urgently hoping for reform. Under the influence of various complex factors, we took a more rigid model than the Stalinist model as the development and transcendence of contemporary Marxism.
The centralized planned system adapted to the needs of the development of productivity at that time, but it could not provide mature democracy rooted in the full development of the commodity economy and relative development of the market economy in the short term. These institutional characteristics, restrictions on emancipating the mind, theoretical innovation, and the Sinicization of Marxism, cannot be compensated by simply calling for the promotion of democratic style. Moreover, just as the economic development of backward countries cannot be achieved overnight, the transition from traditional system to modern democratic system cannot be realized in the short term either. In this way, we are faced with a dilemma: the Sinicization of Marxism must rely on a certain degree of development of socialist democratization, but this democratization is stumbling due to institutional flaws and the expanded class struggle. The end of the nearly nine-month rectification campaign, which ended with the Lushan Conference, is an example of this. This contradiction not only explains to a considerable extent why the second leap of Sinicization of Marxism was not completed between 1949 and 1978, but also points out that the realization of the "second leap" can only be hoped for through China's reforms and the development of democracy inside and outside the party.
From the First Zhengzhou Conference to the early stage of the Lushan Conference in 1959, after nearly nine months of intense efforts, the serious consequences caused by the "Great Leap Forward" were initially contained, and the situation began to turn for the better. During this period, central leaders conducted in-depth practical investigations, studies of Marxist works, and put forward some correct theoretical viewpoints and policy ideas, which have significant long-term significance. However, at that time, Mao Zedong and most of the party members still lacked a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the mistakes, and the correction of the "left" errors was far from complete. It is in this background that the potential for significant reversals after the later stage of the Lushan Conference was provided.
The repeated rectification of "left" deviation in the past nine months reveals several systematic issues in the process of Marxist sinicization in China: first, the lag in the modernization of Marxism and institutional reforms fundamentally constrains the efforts to rectify the "left" deviation and the progress of Marxist sinicization. This is the basic reason for the period between 1949 and 1978 being a stage of "extension and preparation" of sinicization. Second, this lag is mostly a limitation of the times. Third, under socialist conditions, the development of Marxist sinicization cannot be separated from the advancement of socialist democratization and political system reform.

Chapter 8 Two Development Trends in Adjustment.
In "Seventy Years of the Chinese Communist Party" edited by Hu Sheng, there is a classic summary of the exploration period from 1956 to 1966. It states: "During the ten years of exploration, the Party's guiding ideology had two developmental tendencies. One is the correct and relatively correct tendency, which refers to the formation of some correct and relatively correct theoretical viewpoints, policy guidelines, and accumulated practical experiences during the process of exploring China's own path of building socialism. This mainly refers to the positive achievements obtained during the period before and after the 8th National Congress in 1956, the exploration of the eight to nine months before the Lushan Conference in 1959, and the five-year adjustment period after the winter of 1960. The other tendency is the incorrect tendency, which refers to some erroneous theoretical viewpoints, policy ideas, and practical experiences that were formed during the process of exploring China's own path of building socialism." "At the same time, it should be noted that the correct development tendency and the incorrect development tendency during this ten-year exploration are not completely separate. Many times, they permeate and intertwine with each other, not only coexisting in the Party's collective exploration process but also often coexisting within the cognitive development process of the same individual. Sometimes one tendency prevails in the Party, while sometimes the other tendency prevails, or different tendencies coexist in different areas."
From the basic content and process, although there are differences in degree and duration between the period of over a year before and after September 1956, the period from November 1958 to early July 1959, and the period from the end of 1960 to 1966, their underlying basic elements and developmental tendencies are basically the same. Among these three periods dominated by correct and relatively correct developmental tendencies, the period from the end of 1960 to 1966, which witnessed over six years of adjustment, had the most severe background, the longest duration, and the greatest achievements (mainly in the economic field). However, it ended with the outbreak of the "Cultural Revolution," similar to the endings of the previous two rectifications of "left" deviations. This somewhat indicates that in general, without touching the definition of the main contradictions in socialism, without touching the political and leadership systems, the outcome of rectifying "left" deviations can only be like this. The experiences and outcomes of these three periods of rectification of "left" deviations profoundly reveal some regular phenomena in the development of socialism in our country and some regular changes in the process of the sinicization of Marxism.
I. The Party widely promoted the trend of investigation and research, correcting the ideological line.
1. Restarting the rectification of "left" in the face of severe difficulties
In the later stage of the Lu Shan Conference, the reversal from rectifying the "left" to combating the Right-wing disrupted the just-started rectification process of the "left". The large-scale struggle against Right-deviation launched nationwide after the meeting not only brought serious political consequences, but also interrupted the positive progress of rectification in the economic sphere. Under the call for "combating Right-deviation", a new peak of the "Great Leap Forward" was once again initiated, and the "Five Winds" spread once more, exacerbating the development of some errors that had already been addressed since the first Zhengzhou Conference. The "Great Leap Forward" once again caused great damage to productivity, leading to severe economic difficulties.
By the latter half of 1960, the deteriorating situation had reached a point where it was difficult to sustain the entire national economy without adjustment. In November 1960, the Central Committee issued an urgent instruction titled "Urgent Instruction Letter on Current Policy Issues of People's Communes in Rural Areas" (referred to as the "Urgent Instruction Letter"), with Zhou Enlai as the lead. The core of the "Urgent Instruction Letter" was to require the entire party to make the greatest efforts to rectify errors such as the "communist wind", essentially restarting the interrupted process of rectification due to the struggle against Right-deviation after the Lu Shan Conference. It served as the starting point for reversing the severe situation in rural areas. In January 1961, at the 9th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee, the guideline of "adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement" for the national economy from 1961 onwards was determined. These two events marked an important shift in the guiding principles of the Party in this historical stage. The severe difficulties and losses deepened people's understanding of the errors of the "Great Leap Forward" and the movement towards people's communes, realizing that deviating from the correct path was actually departing from breaking away from the Soviet model, applying and "developing" Marxism, and realizing Marxism in China as in 1958. In the late 1950s, Tian Jiaying, Mao Zedong's secretary, once said in a scholarly discussion: If we could start socialism again from scratch, I would adopt a different approach. At that time, there were probably many people who had such an understanding.
In the process of adjusting policies and overcoming difficulties, the Party continued its efforts to correct "leftist" errors from the first Zhengzhou Conference to the early period of the Lushan Conference, and continued its efforts before and after the Eighth National Congress to further explore China's own path of socialist construction. Whether recognized at the time or not, this process was also a process of re-understanding "what socialism is" and exploring the correct path of adapting Marxism to China's conditions in practice.
On June 18, 1960, Mao Zedong summarized the experience and lessons of revolution and construction since the founding of the New China in a famous article called "Ten Years of Summary." Some of the insights in the article were newfound realizations and breakthroughs after taking detours, which were correct; while some understandings were still in line with the viewpoints of the "Great Leap Forward" and "people's commune". The article stated: "In the first eight years, we copied foreign experiences. But starting from the proposal of the Ten Major Relationships in 1956, we began to find our own path suitable for China." He admitted: "I myself have made many mistakes. Some of them were made together with others." "It seems that mistakes are unavoidable." "The general line of our Party is correct, and our actual work is basically done well. There are probably some errors that are difficult to avoid. Where can you find a so-called saint who never makes mistakes or completes truth in one go? Truth is not achieved in one go, but gradually. We are dialectical materialists in terms of epistemology, not metaphysical epistemologists. Freedom is the understanding of necessity and the transformation of the world. The leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom is gradually accomplished in a long-term process of understanding. For the socialist revolution and construction in our country, we have had ten years of experience and have learned a lot. However, we still have a great blindness and a great unknown kingdom of necessity in the socialist era. We do not deeply understand it. We need to spend the second decade investigating and studying it, to find its inherent laws, so as to utilize these laws to serve the socialist revolution and construction." Mao Zedong's article focused on summarizing experience from the perspective of epistemology, setting the correct direction from the ideological standpoint, which had a great influence within the Party and laid the ideological foundation for a thorough summary of experience, comprehensive adjustment, and correct direction of the sinicization of Marxism. However, this way of summarizing experience was still preliminary. As mentioned earlier, to truly correct errors such as the "Great Leap Forward", several equally important factors, such as intra-party democracy, were needed. At that time, progress in this aspect was not apparent.
2. The whole Party embarked on vigorous investigation and research.
At the beginning of the adjustment, Mao Zedong strictly demanded in some important instructions and remarks that party committees at all levels must make up their minds to thoroughly correct the "Five Winds" with an emphasis on the "Communist style." In a comment drafted for the Central Committee, Mao admitted that he himself had made mistakes and must correct them, in order to push the cadres to realize that "now is the time to make up our minds to correct the mistakes." He believed that the errors in these years directly stemmed from subjectivism and one-sidedness in thinking methods, and therefore repeatedly emphasized the need to restore the fine traditions of seeking truth from facts and conducting investigations and research. He said that our party has a tradition of seeking truth from facts, which is to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the realities of China. However, after the founding of the country, especially in recent years, we have not gained a deep understanding of the actual situation. He called for the entire party to promote the trend of conducting investigations and research, starting with reality, and requested that 1961 be the year of seeking truth from facts and conducting investigations and research. Subsequently, the Central Committee issued a letter entitled "On Seriously Carrying Out Investigation Work" to various central departments, provincial, municipal, and district party committees, which included an article written by Mao Zedong in 1930 entitled "On Investigation Work" (later published under the title "Opposing Book Worship"), which had been lost for many years and recently rediscovered. It required leadership organs at all levels above the county to contact reality and conduct in-depth study. The letter stated: "Start from reality, without investigations there is no right to speak, and it must become the primary criterion for the thinking and action of all party cadres." "When conducting investigations, do not be afraid of hearing differing opinions grounded in reality, and even more so, do not be afraid of actual verification overturning judgments and decisions that have already been made." In fact, this posed a question to the leading cadres of the entire party about rectifying the ideological line. It emphasized that practice should be the criterion for testing truth, rather than judgments made in the past, thereby opening up a path for correcting past erroneous decisions based on the verification of practice.
After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1961, Mao Zedong directly organized and guided three investigation groups, which went to rural areas in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangdong for investigations. Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and others also went to Hunan, Hebei, Sichuan, Beijing, and other places respectively to conduct in-depth grassroots investigations and research. Liu Shaoqi sincerely apologized to the members when conducting investigations in Ningxiang County and Changsha County, Hunan, saying that the central committee had done something wrong and we were sorry to everyone; but in order to correct the mistakes, we need to understand the real situation, and I hope you can help me by providing the true situation. After preliminary investigations, he clearly believed: "The canteens were barely established and are extremely unpopular. On this issue, we have made mistakes and have been blindly pushing forward for three years without understanding. Such canteens should have been demolished long ago." Through in-depth investigations and research, Liu Shaoqi felt that the main cause of the difficulties in the local rural areas was not natural disasters, but rather our mistakes in our work, which the local farmers referred to as "30% natural disaster and 70% man-made disaster." During investigations in Hebei, Zhou Enlai was bluntly told by a member: "The living conditions have gotten worse over the past two years," "If this continues for another two years, even you won't have anything to eat." After investigations, Zhou Enlai reported through a phone call to Mao Zedong and raised several major issues existing in people's communes: the vast majority, even all the members, are willing to return home to cook; the members do not agree with the rationing system; the member masses urgently demand a return to the method of scoring work according to the level of the advanced communes, and so on. Less than a year ago, the canteen issue, the rationing system issue, the ownership issue of people's communes, and other issues were considered as socialist positions that had to be upheld, were highly affirmed by Mao Zedong, and were regarded as the focus of the struggle between socialism and capitalism. However, in the in-depth investigations of the entire party, all of these seemingly unshakable things were refuted one after another.
Following Mao Zedong's instructions, the entire party rose up to conduct investigations and research. Leaders of various central departments and provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional party committees, as well as leaders of central and state organs and the departments of party and government in provinces, municipalities, and districts, all went down to conduct focused investigations at the county, commune, and brigade levels. In-depth investigations gradually unified the party's understanding of issues such as the canteen problem, the rationing system problem, subsidiary family businesses, and private plots, directly promoting the adjustment of rural policies and driving the adjustment of work in various other fields.
One of the basic prerequisites for the Sinicization of Marxism is a realistic understanding of the national conditions. The shallow and chaotic understanding of this kind is one of the main reasons for the occurrence of movements like the "Great Leap Forward." At the beginning of the adjustment, Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee started by emphasizing investigation and research, which to a certain extent restored the ideology of seeking truth from facts, thus laying down the ideological foundation for comprehensive adjustment and also correcting the direction of the Sinicization of Marxism to some extent. From a fundamental perspective, this process is consistent with the process of rectifying "Left" mistakes, particularly starting in November 1958.
II. Comprehensive adjustment and deepening the understanding of socialism
1. The adjustment of rural policies, etc.
With the continuous deepening of research and the initial correction of ideological trends, adjustments to rural policies are also being further deepened.
In large-scale surveys, leaders at all levels, from the central to the local level, have found that although specific measures have been formulated to implement the "Urgent Directive on Current Policy Issues of Rural People's Communes" in various regions, some places still just go through the motions. Moreover, the "Urgent Directive" itself has not completely addressed the two major issues of egalitarianism within the production brigades of rural communes and among members within the brigades. In order to systematically solve various serious problems of rural people's communes, including these two forms of egalitarianism, in March 1961, Mao Zedong, presided over the formulation of the "Regulations on the Work of Rural People's Communes (Draft)" (referred to as "Sixty Articles on Agriculture") in Guangzhou, and sent it out to all rural party branches and commune members nationwide to solicit feedback for revisions. After extensive discussions and pilots by cadres and the masses, several major revisions were made to the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture". In the trial revision draft issued in June of that year, some unpopular aspects of the system of general supply and public canteens, which had been referred to as "new things" of communism in 1958, causing significant damage to rural productivity, were canceled. This decision was greatly welcomed by the farmers. These two measures, which were considered "must be done well" and "must be adhered to" in the "Urgent Directive" at the end of 1960 and the initial draft of the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture" in March 1961, were both regarded as major charges of "right-wing opportunism" when canceling or suggesting the cancellation of public canteens during the "anti-rightist" movement in the second half of 1958 and 1959. In September, based on the opinions of several provinces, Mao Zedong proposed to decentralize the basic accounting unit of people's communes to a production team equivalent to the size of a primary cooperative. In a letter to the central government, he said: "We still haven't completely resolved our serious egalitarianism in agriculture, and we still have one problem left: production rights are in the hands of the small teams, but distribution rights are in the hands of the big teams. This serious contradiction still restricts the productivity of the masses. "On this issue, we have been in a confused state for the past six years (since the establishment of the advanced cooperatives in 1956). In the seventh year, we should wake up", according to Mao Zedong's views, the revised version of the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture" stipulated that people's communes in rural areas, based on production teams, should implement a three-tier collective ownership system, which is a fundamental system implemented over a long period of time.
The "Sixty Articles on Agriculture" is an important document for the party to adjust rural production relations and promote the recovery and development of agricultural production. This regulation, while maintaining the overall framework of the people's communes, corrected several prominent errors in rural practical work since the implementation of communalization, and resolved the most pressing issues based on popular opinions at that time. Although it did not completely solve some fundamental issues of the people's communes, it played an important role in mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm and restoring and developing agricultural production. For a considerable period of time afterward, even during turmoil like the "Cultural Revolution", it played a positive role in curbing the resurgence of the "communist wind". From the "Urgent Directive" to the revised "Sixty Articles on Agriculture", the major adjustments made by the party to the people's commune system were not only a continuation of the first Zhengzhou Conference in 1958 but can also be traced back to efforts to adjust internal relations within cooperatives after the peak of agricultural collectivization. In a sense, it was also a kind of return to the primary cooperatives that were quickly replaced by advanced cooperatives and a negation of the rapid escalation of rural production relations in the mid to late 1950s. This "retreat" reflects some progress in the understanding of socialism, bringing it closer to the reality of China.
During this period, following the same spirit, the Central Committee of the Party also took steps to address the issues related to rural and urban handicrafts and commercial policies. In June 1961, the Central Committee issued the "35 Articles on Handicrafts", which clearly stated that collective ownership was the main form of ownership in the entire socialist stage of handicrafts, and individual ownership was a necessary supplement and assistant to the socialist economy. State ownership can only be partial, as an excessive and premature transition to state ownership in production would be detrimental. At the same time, the "40 Articles on Commerce" affirmed that, in addition to state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperative commerce, the rural market trade was a necessary supplement to the two channels. The formulation and implementation of these policies rectified the mistakes made since the "Great Leap Forward", such as the abolition of rural market trade and small vendors, and the erroneous transition from collective handicrafts and commerce to state ownership.
2. Adjustments in the industrial sector
The adjustments in the industrial sector primarily involved slowing down the pace and lowering the targets. However, achieving this in a short period of time was not an easy task, given the background of high targets and high pace that had reached extreme levels after 1958. Although the Eight Guidelines for Economic Adjustment were proposed in September 1960, it was not until the second half of 1961 that they gradually began to be implemented. At the Central Work Conference in September 1961, Zhou Enlai emphasized that targets should be resolutely reduced, with room for adjustment, and this year should be determined as the time for readjustment. Deng Xiaoping proposed that the general principle of adjustment should be to protect agriculture, protect the market for light industry, and take into account national defense, and based on this, the front line should be shortened. The "Instructions of the CPC Central Committee on the Current Industrial Issues" passed at the conference pointed out that we had already lost a year of opportunity and could no longer hesitate. We must make decisive decisions to reduce the targets for industrial production and basic construction to a reliable and adjustable level. In the next three years, the adjustment should be the focus in implementing the Eight Guidelines. If we don't have the determination to do this and still insist on unrealistic targets, neither moving forward nor willing to retreat, our industry and even the entire national economy will fall into a more passive and serious situation. After the conference, with the approval of the Central Committee, the State Planning Commission made significant adjustments to the 1961 plan. The successive reductions in production targets were a clear denial of the enthusiasm for the "Great Leap Forward" and a result of a deeper understanding of the national situation. In other words, in the process of correcting the "leftist" errors, the Sinicization of Marxism took an important step in the right direction.
Another aspect of industrial adjustment is to rectify the disrupted production order caused by the "Great Leap Forward." The "Great Leap Forward" was a bold attempt to break away from the Soviet model, but due to limitations in the development of productive forces and misinterpretations of "liberating thoughts," "eliminating superstitions," and "mass movements," these attempts often turned into a contempt of small-scale production towards large-scale production and a blind revolutionary enthusiasm that rejected production order. This resulted in many problems for enterprises, such as chaotic management, relaxation of the system of responsibility and economic accounting, equipment damage, prevalence of egalitarianism in distribution systems, decreased product quality and labor productivity, and so on. During the adjustment period, Deng Xiaoping emphasized on multiple occasions the need to rectify industrial enterprises and address the chaos. During the formulation of the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture," Mao Zedong proposed the opinion that "the cities should also have dozens of articles." Based on this, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and the responsibility of Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo, 11 working groups were dispatched to many industrial and mining enterprises for investigation. Based on extensive research and discussions, the "Regulations on the Work of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises (Draft)" (referred to as the "Seventy Articles on Industry") were formed. After discussion at the Lu Mountain Central Work Conference, they were issued for trial implementation by the Central Committee in September 1961.
The "Seventy Articles on Industry" systematically summarized the experiences and lessons of industrial management work since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, especially since the "Great Leap Forward." It put forward some guiding principles for the management of state-owned enterprises in China and made many specific provisions. The regulations determined that the state would implement "five guarantees" for enterprises, while enterprises would implement "five services" for the state. The regulations also made detailed provisions for the operation and responsibilities of the system of factory directors under the leadership of the Party committee, the system of worker congresses, and the production administrative command system led by the factory director. The regulations stipulated the establishment of strict responsibility systems at all levels, in all aspects, and at all stages, and the implementation of comprehensive economic accounting, emphasizing economic effect. The regulations emphasized strengthening the management of state-owned enterprises according to a strict system of mandatory plans. They not only restored the industrial enterprise regulations and normal production order that were denied and disrupted during the "Great Leap Forward" movement, but also established some systems that had not been established before the "Great Leap Forward," taking a step forward towards standardized and sound management of China's industrial enterprises. After the issuance of the "Seventy Articles on Industry," it was supported by the majority of cadres and workers. Due to the implementation of this regulation, a series of necessary regulations were restored and established for state-owned enterprises, playing a positive role in the adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement of industry.
3. Adjustments in the superstructure field.
The Anti-Rightist Movement, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune Movement all involved serious left-leaning errors that affected various aspects such as the economic foundation, superstructure, and ideology. In order to correct these errors, adjustments in all of these areas were inevitable in the early 1960s. As the adjustments in the economic field gradually deepened, adjustments in politics, ideology, science, education, culture, united front work, religion, and nationality followed suit.
The Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957 caused serious harm to intellectuals in the superstructure and ideological fields. Subsequently, the Great Leap Forward, Anti-Rightist, and other movements in fields such as science, education, and literature led to the prevalence of extravagant tendencies and blind command, and the continuous political movements greatly impacted the work in science, education, and literature. Normal work order was disrupted, and the enthusiasm of intellectuals was severely dampened. This, in turn, had a serious negative impact on economic work.
The adjustments in the fields of science, education, and culture in the early 1960s began with the formulation of regulations for work in these areas. Starting from the winter of 1960, under the leadership of Nie Rongzhen, the National Science Commission conducted repeated investigations and research and extensively solicited opinions from the scientific community. In 1961, they proposed "Fourteen Opinions on the Current Work of Natural Science Research Institutions (Draft)" (referred to as "Fourteen Scientific Opinions"). In July, it was discussed and approved by the Central Politburo and issued for trial implementation. In the field of education, starting from 1961, the party group of the Ministry of Education specifically held symposiums, inviting leaders and professors from certain universities to seek opinions. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the party group of the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department drafted the "Provisional Regulations on the Work of Higher Education Institutions Directly Under the Ministry of Education (Draft)" (referred to as "Sixty Higher Education Regulations"). In September, after discussion and approval at the Lushan Central Work Conference, the draft was issued for trial implementation. While drafting the "Sixty Higher Education Regulations," the Ministry of Education also began drafting regulations for primary and secondary education according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee. These were later written as the "Provisional Regulations on Full-time Middle School Work (Draft)" (referred to as "Fifty Middle School Regulations") and the "Provisional Regulations on Full-time Primary School Work (Draft)" (referred to as "Forty Primary School Regulations"), which were approved and implemented by the Party Central Committee in March 1963. Under the urging of Zhou Enlai, the party group of the Central Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Culture, and the party group of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles drafted the "Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work (Draft)" (referred to as "Ten Literary and Art Opinions") in the first half of 1961, based on extensive investigations and research. Later, based on feedback from various regions, it was revised to become the "Eight Literary and Art Opinions," which were approved for nationwide implementation by the Party Central Committee in April 1962.
These regulations in science, education, and art summarize the experiences and lessons since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, especially during the "Great Leap Forward". They not only acknowledge achievements but also point out the shortcomings and mistakes in the work of the past three years. They propose a series of policies to adjust relationships, stabilize work order, and mobilize the enthusiasm of intellectuals, and make corresponding specific provisions. A central issue of these regulations is to adjust the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. Since the "Great Leap Forward", there have been excessive and erroneous criticisms among intellectuals, such as "pulling up the white flag", criticizing "bourgeois academic authority", and attacking "bourgeois specialists". Some party members and cadres in cultural and educational organizations even regarded most intellectuals as belonging to the bourgeoisie and as the targets of socialist revolution. After the "Anti-Rightist Struggle" in 1959, this "leftist" tendency further escalated. It is in response to this situation that these regulations particularly emphasize the need to treat knowledge and intellectuals correctly and to adjust the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. The Central Committee states in its comments that doing a good job with intellectuals is of utmost importance. In recent years, some comrades have had some one-sided understanding of the issue of knowledge and intellectuals. There have been instances of simplification and rudeness, which must be taken seriously and corrected. In academic work, there must be an environment where diverse viewpoints can be freely expressed and debated, without using labels, violence, or personal attacks. The enthusiasm of intellectuals should be fully mobilized, allowing them to work with confidence and responsibility. All departments and units engaged in intellectual work are required to review the criticisms made among intellectuals since the "Anti-Rightist Struggle". Where the criticisms are justified, they must be upheld. Where there are mistakes or partial mistakes in the criticisms, the facts should be discerned, right from wrong, errors corrected, and wrongly labeled individuals should have their labels removed, in order to relieve psychological burdens, promote democracy, and enhance unity.
Another important aspect of these regulations is the implementation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend". This is closely related to adjusting the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. These regulations propose that in natural science academic issues, it is necessary to encourage the free discussion, debate, and competition of various schools of thought and academic perspectives. In philosophy and the social sciences, it is necessary to critically inherit the historical and cultural heritage and absorb all valuable elements from it. Within the people and within the Marxist community, the discussion of various academic issues must allow for different opinions to be freely debated. In literary and artistic creation, writers and artists have full freedom to choose and handle subjects, advocating diversity of styles and the development of different artistic genres. In literary and artistic criticism, there is freedom to discuss and criticize different opinions on literary and artistic works and theories, as well as to retain and engage in counter-criticism. These regulations also discuss and specify a series of specific policies for implementing the "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, emphasizing that political methods should not be used, and enemy-style struggles are not allowed to be applied to handling the different academic and artistic viewpoints within the people.
In response to the excessive chaos in production labor and social activities, as well as the exaggerated and arbitrary commanding styles in the scientific, educational, and artistic sectors since the Great Leap Forward, and the problems of the party organizations taking charge of everything, excessive party committee intervention in business and administrative work, and management and business personnel being afraid to take responsibility, these regulations clearly stipulate that the fundamental tasks of scientific research institutions are to produce results, cultivate talent, and serve socialism. It must guarantee the stability of research work and ensure that at least five out of six parts of the researchers' time is spent on business work. Schools prioritize teaching, and students prioritize learning. Art should serve politics, but it should not be excessively narrow-minded. Art should not only inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people and raise their ideological awareness, but also provide them with proper artistic enjoyment and healthy entertainment. Any work that can satisfy any of these requirements serves the people and serves socialism. The main task of the party committees in research institutions, higher education institutions, and cultural departments is to implement the party's policies, prevent micromanagement and arbitrary decision-making, and so on.
The formulation and implementation of these regulations have had a positive impact on intellectuals both inside and outside the party. It has eased the tense relationship between the party and intellectuals, restored work order, and gradually developed its own set of policies and specific systems for China's socialist scientific, educational, and cultural undertakings based on the summary of experiences, playing an important role. Although the issue of the expansion of the struggle against the rightists has not been resolved, most intellectuals have already felt more at ease at this time, and the conditions for focusing on business work have been largely established.
Ⅲ. The Seven Thousand People's Conference and further adjustments thereafter.
1. Reflection on the 7,000 People's Conference
After more than a year of adjustment, the severe economic difficulties caused by the "Great Leap Forward" began to show signs of improvement, production order gradually resumed, and adjustments in various relationships were also initiated. However, the overall situation remained extremely difficult. Faced with this situation, there were various doubts and disagreements in ideological understanding both inside and outside the party. To further summarize the experiences and lessons since 1958, unify and elevate the party's understanding, strengthen unity, mobilize the entire party to resolutely implement adjustment policies, and strive to overcome severe difficulties, the Central Committee of the Party convened an expanded Central Working Conference in Beijing from January 11th to February 7th, 1962, known as the "7,000 People's Conference".
In his written report at the conference, Liu Shaoqi focused on analyzing the main shortcomings and errors in the work and analyzing their causes. Regarding the causes of the errors, he pointed out that, on one hand, it was due to a lack of experience in construction work, and on the other hand, many leading comrades within the party were not humble and cautious enough, violating the party's tradition of seeking truth from facts and the mass line, thereby weakening the principle of democratic centralism, which hindered the party from timely discovering and correcting errors. In his speech at the conference, he addressed several important issues that were causing doubts within the party, stating important viewpoints: we should acknowledge that we currently face considerable difficulties in the economy; regarding achievements and mistakes, in the past, we often compared the relationship between shortcomings/errors and achievements to that of one finger and nine fingers, but now it is probably not applicable everywhere. Looking at the nationwide situation, the relationship might be three fingers and seven fingers, and in some areas, the mistakes may even account for seven fingers; regarding the reasons for the economic difficulties, on one hand, it was due to natural disasters, and on the other hand, to a large extent, it was caused by errors in our work, some places experienced "three parts natural disaster, seven parts human error"; regarding the "Three Red Flags," we will not cancel them now, they will continue to be upheld. However, we currently do not clearly see some issues, but after five or ten years, when we summarize our experiences again, we will be able to draw further conclusions. At that time, it was difficult to criticize the "Three Red Flags" head-on or discuss them in formal occasions, so Liu Shaoqi's reserved attitude received sincere support from many people, as it reflected the views of many at that time. Liu Shaoqi's written report and speech were warmly welcomed by everyone.
In his lengthy speech on January 30th, Mao Zedong focused on the democratic centralism. He emphasized the need for sufficient democratic centralism within and outside the party, allowing the masses to speak. Democratic centralism is enshrined in the party's constitution and laws, and it is essential to overcome the difficulties faced. Without democratic centralism, it is not possible. In the presence of mistakes, self-criticism must be carried out, and people's criticism must be encouraged. Mao made self-criticism by stating, "For all the mistakes committed by the central party, I take direct responsibility, and indirectly, I am also partially responsible because I am the chairman of the central party." He also emphasized that there is still a lot of blindness in socialist construction. There are many unknown territories in the socialist economy that we still need to explore. In the future, we need to conduct in-depth investigations and research on it, gradually deepening our understanding through practice. He pointed out that China has a large population, a weak foundation, and an economically backward state. In order to develop the productive forces to a great extent and catch up with or surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in the world, it will take more than a hundred years. For this cause, we must combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific realities of China's socialist construction, as well as the future realities of world revolution, as best as we can, in order to gradually understand the objective laws of struggle through practice. Starting from this point, it is beneficial to think in the long term; imagining a shorter period of time would be detrimental. He linked the three-year "Great Leap Forward" campaign, admitting the significant blindness still present in socialist construction, indicating his progress in understanding. This played a significant role in further summarizing the construction practices of the past few years and correcting errors.
If Mao Zedong emphasized seeking truth from facts and conducting investigations and research as a key point in early 1961, highlighting it as a fundamental element of the Sinification of Marxism, then after nearly a year, following some progress made in adjustments, he once again emphasized the other fundamental element of correcting "left" errors and achieving Sinification—democracy. The Anti-Rightist Movement severely undermined democratic principles both inside and outside the party, which was an important reason for the subsequent mistakes in economic development. Without addressing these errors, it would be impossible to discuss adjustments in other areas. This conforms to the laws of understanding and meets the needs for further adjustment. However, Mao Zedong also pointed out the limitations of democracy in his meeting: firstly, without a correct understanding of the main contradictions in socialist society, true socialist democracy in a real sense would not be possible. Secondly, understanding democracy merely as "allowing the masses to speak" and "allowing criticism from individuals" is clearly insufficient. This is a kind of "top-down" democracy, which, although better than not allowing people to speak, can still be "taken back" under various pretexts due to changes in the leader's understanding and attitude. Such democracy is still far from genuine socialist democracy. Genuine socialist democracy is not something bestowed upon by any person but is inherent in the level of productive forces, economic foundation, and superstructure; it is an inalienable right of every party member and the masses. This somewhat limited democracy has played a role in the initial stages of adjustment but cannot guarantee the needs for further deepening of adjustment. As the adjustment becomes more profound, the differences in the understanding of "what is socialism" become more evident. Under the premise that class struggle has been identified as the primary contradiction, it is more likely to elevate these differences to the "height" of class struggle, go beyond the limits of democracy, and end certain adjustments. The democracy required for the Sinification of Marxism cannot be this kind of highly limited democracy.
Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai made speeches at the conference, representing the Central Secretariat and the State Council respectively, to engage in self-criticism. Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech that the Party's leadership and work have serious shortcomings. In terms of the entire Party, the fine traditions of the Party have been weakened to a certain extent, especially the neglect and damage to the traditions of seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and democratic centralism, which have brought great harm to the work. Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech: in the past few years, the work often focused only on subjective needs, disregarding objective possibilities; only focusing on current requirements without long-term planning, resulting in failure when seeking rapid progress. He emphasized the importance of speaking the truth, being enthusiastic, doing practical work, and achieving real results. Zhu De and Chen Yun also emphasized the correction of "left" errors and the issue of democratic life within the Party in their speeches.
Under the historical conditions at the time, the Seventh Thousand People's Congress achieved important results that could be achieved. The conference promoted internal democracy within the Party to a certain extent and was essentially an adjustment of internal party relations. Based on this, the conference adopted a relatively pragmatic attitude towards shortcomings and errors and conducted a relatively objective and in-depth summary of experiences and lessons. The democratic spirit and self-criticism spirit of the conference encouraged the entire Party and played a positive role in mobilizing the whole Party to unite and fight against difficulties. Due to the limitations of historical conditions, the conference still affirmed the "Three Red Banners" in principle; in the struggle against the "rightist" trend, it only rehabilitated party members who had been wrongly criticized at lower levels, but Peng Dehuai was not rehabilitated; there were still differences within the Party in assessing the situation and analyzing the causes of difficulties. All of this indicates that, under the conditions at the time, there were considerable limitations in rectifying the mistakes of the "Great Leap Forward" and the "rightist" trend from the guiding ideology.
The attitude, depth, and achievements of the Seventh Thousand People's Congress in countering the "left" stance contrast sharply with the criticism of the "Leap Forward," the People's Commune movement in the first half of 1958, and the "rightist" trend after August 1959. These achievements were the result of the entire Party earnestly learning lessons from failures, abandoning certain incorrect socialist concepts, and adopting socialist concepts suitable for China's national conditions to a greater extent; they also benefited from relatively active internal party democracy in the face of severe difficulties. After the Seventh Thousand People's Congress, the entire Party still faced two basic choices: one was to continue the efforts to rectify the "left" since the end of 1960 and continue the healthy development momentum; the other was to discount the adjustments due to the inability to touch on some more fundamental traditional concepts, or even give up halfway. The reasons for this, in addition to certain temporal limitations in understanding, also have a more direct impact on the system. This has already been clearly demonstrated in the discontinuation of the "Leap Forward" and the nine-month interruption in rectifying the "left."
2. Further adjustments after the Seventh Thousand People's Congress
After the Seventh Thousand People's Conference, there was a period of time during which adjustments in the economic and political aspects continued to develop, achieving more profound accomplishments in some areas.
Shortly after the Seventh Thousand People's Conference, the central government found that the estimation of the difficulty level of the economic situation was still inadequate. Based on new analysis provided by the Ministry of Finance, Liu Shaoqi pointed out in a Politburo Standing Committee enlarged meeting in late February 1962 that the country was currently in an "extraordinary period," and if decisive measures were not taken, the national economy would deteriorate further. Chen Yun expressed his systematic opinions during the meeting and received warm approval. Based on these ideas, a plan for further comprehensive adjustments to the national economy was discussed and adopted in the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee held in May. This plan included vigorously streamlining the workforce, further reducing the scale of basic construction, shortening the industrial front, further strengthening agriculture from all perspectives, and enhancing the leadership capability at the grassroots level in rural areas, among other measures. As a result of implementing these decisive measures and after the arduous struggle of the entire population, the adjustment work achieved relatively rapid results. By the end of 1962, the national economic situation began to improve: agricultural production started to recover, the proportionate relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry improved, national fiscal revenue and expenditure balanced, the tense situation of supply and demand of market commodities eased, and the living conditions of urban and rural residents began to improve.
The continuous deepening of the adjustment work allowed people's thoughts to be somewhat liberated, and suppressed viewpoints and practices from the past became active again. In addition, the severe economic situation also prompted people to seek various ways to overcome the difficulties. It is precisely under such circumstances that various forms of production responsibility systems in agriculture reappeared and rapidly expanded. After the basic accounting unit of the rural people's commune was devolved to the production team equivalent to the original primary cooperative, the enthusiasm of the farmers significantly increased. However, they were not satisfied with this "backwardness" and hoped to combine their income with their labor input more closely through more effective forms of responsibility systems. As a result, various forms of the "household contract responsibility system" spontaneously emerged in many places. Since the establishment of collective ownership, whenever the Party proposed adjustments to the production relationships within the agricultural collective economic organizations, there have always been cases of farmers spontaneously implementing the "household contract responsibility system." Despite repeated prohibitions, it would reappear whenever there was an opportunity. This eloquently proves that as a level within the collective economy, family-based operations are suitable for the production circumstances in Chinese rural areas where manual labor is predominant, and they meet the needs of the majority of Chinese farmers. There were different opinions within the Party regarding the implementation of the "household contract responsibility system" from the very beginning. In November 1961, the central government stated in an instruction that the "household contract responsibility system" and certain disguised individualistic practices were "not in line with the principles of socialist collective economy" and demanded a "change." However, by the first half of 1962, the "household contract responsibility system" not only was not effectively stopped, but its vitality became increasingly apparent. By July of that year, over 20% of the rural areas nationwide had implemented various forms of the "household contract responsibility system," and the effects were mostly positive. It was highly welcomed by the rural masses and many grassroots cadres.
Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Zihui, and other comrades from the Party Central Committee and relevant central departments also expressed their positive support for it in their investigations and research. Liu Shaoqi stated that implementing a system of responsibilities, with one household or one group responsible for a piece of land, is entirely feasible; we must make "contracting production to households" legal. Deng Zihui, after conducting investigations, submitted a written opinion to the central leadership in May 1962, proposing that members of the cooperative should be allowed to engage in some "small freedom and small private ownership" within certain limits. He pointed out that establishing a system of production responsibility "is the fundamental link to improving collective production and consolidating collective ownership in the future". Chen Yun, after the investigation, believed that contracting production to households was "an extraordinary measure for extraordinary times". He even suggested: "If contracting production to households is not thorough enough, then it is better to allocate land to households." Deng Xiaoping, when receiving a report from the Rural Office of the East China Bureau in late June of that year, said that in areas where farmers faced difficulties, various methods could be adopted. "Responsibility fields" were a new thing that could be tried out. In July, during a speech, he quoted the famous Sichuan folk proverb often mentioned by Liu Bocheng: "No matter if it is a yellow cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat." He stated, "As for which form of production relations is best, I'm afraid we must adopt an attitude that takes into account which form can more easily and quickly restore and develop agricultural production in each specific locality; whichever form the masses are willing to adopt, we should adopt it and make the illegal form legal." The viewpoints and methods reflected in these colloquial and easy-to-understand language subsequently became the theoretical foundation of the Reform and Opening-up policy - the standard of productive forces.
In terms of adjusting political relationships, during the highest state council meeting held in April 1962, the second session of the National People's Congress and the third session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended the spirit of the 7,000 People's Congress to non-party democratic individuals, acknowledging the shortcomings and mistakes in the work over the past few years, with the responsibility lying with the Communist Party of China, particularly the Central Committee. Zhou Enlai, representing the government, made a sincere self-critique on the issues in the government's work. The representatives of various democratic parties attending the meetings were inspired by the frank, courageous acknowledgment of mistakes and sincere commitment to rectify them by the Communist Party of China, expressing their willingness to cooperate and unite with the Party to overcome difficulties. In order to further strengthen and improve united front work, the CPC Central Committee United Front Work Department, the National Committee of the National People's Congress Ethnic Committee, and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission respectively held national conferences on united front work and ethnic affairs in April and May 1962. The two conferences focused on reviewing some serious "left" mistakes in implementing united front, ethnic, and religious policies since the Great Leap Forward, and studied the guidelines, policies, and specific measures to resolve the problems. The conferences pointed out that the Party must take the initiative to adjust relations with intellectuals, the business community, democratic parties, democratic individuals, religious circles, ethnic minorities, returned overseas Chinese, and other patriots, promote democracy, strengthen unity, fully mobilize all positive factors, work in coordination, overcome current difficulties, and fulfill the task of adjusting the national economy. The National United Front Conference also proposed to properly identify and rehabilitate non-party individuals who were harmed during political movements, properly arrange the placement of those who have had their "rightist" labels removed and those who are still wearing the labels, and not discriminate against the families and children of those classified as rightists in terms of schooling, employment, and daily life. At the same time, the Party Central Committee also made corresponding adjustments to overseas Chinese affairs policies. The National Ethnic Affairs Symposium proposed that during the adjustment period, the main task for minority areas is to adjust ethnic relations and various other relationships in accordance with the central policies, with other aspects of work subordinate to this overall goal. Through adjusting ethnic relations, strengthening ethnic unity, enhancing unity with all patriotic and democratic individuals, strengthening the alliance between workers and peasants, mobilizing the enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups, and concentrating efforts on restoring and developing production. Prior to this, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission formulated the "Regulations on Work in Minority Pastoral Areas and Policies for Pastoral People's Communes" (referred to as the "40 Articles on Pastoral Work") in 1961, which made several adjustments to the policies in minority areas and strengthened support for these regions.
After the meeting of the 7,000 People, with the comprehensive adjustment of the national economy, the adjustment of the party's policy towards intellectuals also deepened further. The regulations on science, education, and literature formulated and implemented in 1961 gradually rectified the direction of intellectual work and initially mobilized the enthusiasm of intellectuals. This deep adjustment will inevitably involve making new scientific judgments on the class nature of intellectuals in our country. After the Anti-Rightist Struggle in 1957, the judgment on the class nature of intellectuals was changed, and they were identified as "bourgeois intellectuals." This label made it difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of intellectuals. In March 1962, at the scientific and technological conference and the literary working conference held in Guangzhou by Zhou Enlai, the basic assessment made by the party at the 1956 Conference of Intellectuals regarding the class status of intellectuals in our country was resolutely restored in substance. It affirmed that the vast majority of intellectuals in our country had already belonged to the intellectual class of the working people, rather than the bourgeois intellectual class. In his speech at the conference, Chen Yi particularly emphasized that after 12 years of testing, especially the severe difficulties in recent years, it had been proven that the vast majority of intellectuals in our country were patriotic, believed in the Communist Party, and shared the same hardships as the Party and the people. If we cannot judge a person after eight years, ten years, or twelve years, then the Communist Party is blind. He announced the "removal" of the hat (the removal of the "bourgeois intellectual" label) and the "coronation" (the coronation of the "intellectual of the working people") for the intellectuals. In the subsequent Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the Second National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai once again announced this scientific judgment in the government's work report. The further adjustment in the policy towards intellectuals greatly mobilized their enthusiasm and made the spring of 1962 an unforgettable day for them.
While adjusting external political relations, the central government also took important steps to adjust internal political relations. In June 1961, the central government issued instructions on reviewing and rehabilitating party members and cadres who had been criticized and punished during the "anti-rightist" movement in the past few years. After the meeting of the 7,000 People, the central government accelerated the progress of this work. Due to uneven progress, in April 1962, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the Secretariat of the Central Committee formulated and issued a notice on accelerating the work of reviewing and rehabilitating party members and cadres. Subsequently, based on the experience of the military, it was suggested to comprehensively solve the cadre problems at the county level and below throughout the country, that is, to fully rehabilitate all cadres who had made mistakes in the past or mostly made mistakes, except for a few with serious issues, without leaving any "tails," and solve them all at once. In this way, the work of reviewing and rehabilitating both inside and outside the party was rapidly and comprehensively carried out. By August 1962, over six million cadres, party members, and the masses nationwide had been rehabilitated.
In terms of external affairs, there were also demands to rectify the "left" tendency. In the spring of 1962, in response to the gradually developing "left" tendency in foreign affairs, Wang Jiaxiang, the Minister of the United Front Department, proposed to the central government that in order to buy time to overcome difficulties and accelerate construction, it was necessary to strive for relative relaxation in foreign relations. In the struggle against the United States, the Soviet Union, and others, attention should be paid to strategy. Foreign aid must be realistic and within our capabilities. Peace movements should be valued, not only national liberation movements but also peace movements, and so on. These opinions strongly advocated adopting a moderate policy towards foreign affairs and were a correction to counter the emerging tendencies of increasing confrontation and escalating rhetoric in international struggles.
In short, in the six months after the meeting of the 7,000 People, the adjustment work showed a stronger momentum of development. This is not only reflected in the wide scope of the adjustment but also in the depth achieved in practice and theory. It is precisely in the process of continuous deep adjustment that the sinicization of Marxism has made some substantial progress.
If this healthy momentum could continue to develop smoothly, then the later "Cultural Revolution" would not have happened, and perhaps China's reforms could have started earlier and more smoothly. However, did the conditions of understanding and the system at that time provide the conditions for this momentum to continue to develop?
IV. Contradictory Patterns Caused by Different Economic and Political Development Directions
1. Adjustment is the answer to correcting "leftist" tendencies.
The adjustment at the beginning of the 1960s started with the urgent need to solve severe economic difficulties at that time. However, it inevitably took a different path from the "Three Red Banners" of 1958, and actually formed another peak in the Marxist Sinicization of China after the establishment of the new China.
Since the end of 1960, after the issuance of the "Urgent Instruction Letter," through mass investigations, exploration, and promotion by the entire party in 1961, it had been fully implemented by the end of 1961 until the 7,000-person conference. After the 7,000-person conference, adjustments showed a rapid development trend in both breadth and depth. The continuously deepening adjustments not only quickly achieved significant results in the economy but also to varying degrees corrected some significant mistakes since 1958 in the production relations, superstructure, and ideological fields. Gradually, they demonstrated characteristics different from the "Great Leap Forward" and the people's commune model, embarking on a path that combines Marxism with China's actual conditions, gradually correcting the correct direction of the Sinicization of Marxism.
The revision of the main contradictions in socialist society after the Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957, and the "Three Red Flags" in 1958 were considered at the time to surpass the Soviet model, representing an important development of Marxism and a new achievement in the Sinicization of Marxism. However, from the perspective of pursuing speed in construction, seeking "one large, two small" in ownership forms, establishing the socialist main contradictions as class contradictions, underestimating the length of the socialist historical stage, and being more eager to transition to communism, etc., it was essentially a more extreme and rigid socialist model than the traditional Soviet model. It certainly had distinctive Chinese characteristics, but it not only deviated from China's actual conditions but also overlooked the inevitable trend of the modernization of Marxism. It considered the correct development trend of Marxism in contemporary times as revisionism, thus inevitably deviating from the correct direction of the Sinicization of Marxism. In essence, it was based on the detachment from China's actual conditions, dogmatically borrowing conclusions from Marxist classic authors nearly a hundred years ago regarding socialism and communism, and incorporating some specific experiences from the era of revolutionary warfare, supplemented by ideals and practices related to the ideal of a utopian society from Chinese traditional culture.
The essence of the early 1960s adjustments was, to a large extent, the correction of the "left" deviations in the economic and political fields since the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958. It was also a certain degree of negation and correction of an erroneous socialist viewpoint. Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and other central leaders' new understanding and summary of the stage of socialist development and economic adjustments were a negation of the pursuit of "high speed" and seeking completion urgently. "The Sixty Articles on Agriculture" negated "one large, two small," supply system, and public canteens. "The Seventy Articles on Industry" rejected the disruption of production order, the monopoly of party organizations over everything, the lack of distinction between politics and enterprises, the disregard for economic laws, the disregard for economic effects, and the disregard for material interests. "The Fourteen Articles on Science" negated the disregard for scientific research laws and the disrespect for scientific and technological personnel. "The Eight Articles on Literature and Art" negated the disrespect for the laws of art and for artists. "The Sixty Articles on Higher Education" negated the disregard for teaching laws and the contempt for intellectuals, and so on.
With the deepening of adjustments, this negation and correction not only become more profound in their content, but also show a trend of accelerating development. The more realistic estimation of the severe economic situation after the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Congress laid the foundation for further deepening the adjustments, and at the same time, it objectively exposed the absurdity of the "Great Leap Forward". The speeches by Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi at the Guangzhou Conference regarding the class nature of intellectuals negated the erroneous characterization of intellectuals since 1957. The accelerated work of reviewing and rehabilitating party members and cadres in the first half of 1962, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, largely negated the "anti-rightist" campaign of 1959, and had begun to touch upon the expansion of the struggle against the rightists in 1957. In the spring of 1962, Wang Jiaxiang proposed to the central authorities about foreign relations, correcting the "left" deviation in foreign affairs at that time. The rapid development of the "contracting responsibility system" in many rural areas in the first half of 1962 not only broke through the bottom line of the "Three Levels Ownership, Team as the Basis" in the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture", but also implied a correction to the haste and crudeness of the socialist transformation of agriculture in 1956. Deng Xiaoping's support for the "cat theory" of contracting responsibility system actually included the replacement of production relations and ideological standards in 1958 with productivity standards... Compared with the two "anti-leftist" rectifications in the first half of 1956 and the second half of 1958 to the first half of 1959, the various specific adjustment measures and understandings during these five years indicate that the adjustments were no longer limited to correcting the extreme socialist model of 1958 and restoring the traditional model, but also demonstrated surpassing the Soviet model and a certain kind of reform, which had a place in the socialist reform wave at that time.
However, the limitations of these adjustments were also apparent. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, the important progress of the adjustments was mostly reflected in the economic aspect. In comparison, the progress in the political aspect and the political system aspect was often very limited, and the development between the two was asynchronous and unbalanced. Second, some fundamental issues related to the deep-level question of "what is socialism" have not been overcome, and until these issues are resolved, other achievements of the adjustments are not secure. It is precisely because of the asynchronous development of politics and economy that conditions were provided for the re-emergence of erroneous or relatively erroneous development tendencies.
However, under the conditions at that time, whether in China or in socialist countries like the Soviet Union, the conditions for comprehensive reform were far from mature. Although the traditional model was subject to some disturbances, some of its basic aspects were still considered sacred and unquestionable, and they were still the consensus of the whole party. This was the case in all socialist countries at that time. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for deep adjustments to fundamentally correct the "left" deviation in the party's guiding ideology. In the party, especially in the leadership, there were actually differences in views on the situation and policies. Under the premise that the criticism and condemnation of the "Anti-Rightist Campaign" in 1957, the expansion of the struggle against the rightists in 1958, the "Three Red Banners" in 1958, and the Lushan Conference in 1959 were untouchable, the depth of the adjustments and the development of understanding inevitably widened the differences. Faced with serious difficulties and with adjustments yet to touch on some more fundamental issues, these contradictions and differences either did not fully manifest or temporarily went underground. After the situation gradually improved, with the further deepening of domestic policy adjustments, the intensification of debates between China and the Soviet Union at that time, and the escalation of tense relations with some neighboring countries and regions, the differences in the party's assessment of the situation and guidance of work gradually developed. To make matters worse, under the gaze of the traditional socialist model, and even more extreme models, these differences were treated as class struggle. As a result, the deep adjustments triggered a new round of the expansion of class struggle.
2. The Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress
At the important moment when the Party Central Committee led the people of the whole country to overcome serious difficulties and made continuous adjustments in various aspects, the Central Committee held a work conference in Beidaihe in August 1962. The original agenda of the conference was to discuss work in agriculture, finance, trade, and other areas, including issues such as the household responsibility system. At the beginning of the conference, Mao Zedong raised the issues of class, the situation, and contradictions, and asked everyone to discuss them. Thus, the focus of the Beidaihe Work Conference shifted to the discussion of class struggle. Subsequently, this topic became the theme of the preparatory meeting of the Eighth Central Committee and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee that followed. At the Beidaihe Work Conference and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Mao Zedong spoke repeatedly, linking criticism of Khrushchev's views in the Soviet Union with measures to adjust the domestic situation, especially after the 7,000 People's Conference, repeatedly raising the issue of class and class struggle. He regarded some differences in understanding within the Party as reflections of class struggle, and he regarded some opinions that he disagreed with but were actually more in line with the objective situation as manifestations of right-wing opportunism and revisionism, calling them "dark winds," "individualistic winds," and "reversal of verdicts winds."
At the end of 1961, until the 7,000 People's Conference, including Mao Zedong, the central leadership recognized the serious economic difficulties. However, there were still different understandings of the severity of the difficulties and whether they had already overcome the most serious difficulties. For example, according to the estimates before the 7,000 People's Conference and at the conference itself, by the beginning of 1962, the national economy had already emerged from the most difficult "valley" and begun to recover. After the 7,000 People's Conference, at the expanded meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee convened by Liu Shaoqi in February 1962 (known as the "West Building Meeting"), based on the analysis of the financial sector, Liu Shaoqi pointed out, "The Central Work Conference (referring to the 7,000 People's Conference) did not thoroughly expose the difficulties, and there are problems they are unwilling to mention, afraid of exposing how dark it is! Revealing its true face, what's to be afraid of? Saying how dark it is can make people pessimistic, but it can also inspire people's courage to fight against difficulties!" This increasingly accurate estimation became the basis for the central authorities to further intensify their adjustments. However, Mao Zedong was dissatisfied with this realistic estimation. At the Beidaihe Work Conference, Mao Zedong said that some people now see the situation as completely bleak, their thinking is confused, they have lost confidence, and they cannot see the bright side. Therefore, they believe that socialism is not feasible and can only rely on individual efforts. This trend becomes more pronounced among the upper echelons. He criticized some central leaders for supporting the household responsibility system, pointing out that they represented the demands of the relatively affluent middle peasants for individual farming and even opposed socialism from the position of the landlord, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie. He also expressed dissatisfaction with the work of identifying and redressing past injustices at that time, saying that the recent trend of rectifying past injustices was inappropriate, and the anti-rightist campaign of 1959 should not be undone. In summary, after the 7,000 People's Conference, the further deepening adjustments in several important aspects were almost regarded as important manifestations of class struggle.
When revising the Communique of the 8th Plenum of the 10th Central Committee, Mao Zedong added a paragraph emphasizing the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, which exists throughout the "entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism." In this historical period, "the overthrown reactionary ruling classes are unwilling to accept their demise, and they always attempt restoration. At the same time, there still exist the influence of the bourgeoisie and the habitual forces of the old society, as well as the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of a section of small producers." "Under these circumstances, class struggle is inevitable. This is a historical law that has long been elucidated by Marxism-Leninism, and we must never forget it." Mao Zedong also said: the issue of class struggle and the danger of capitalist restoration must be emphasized year after year, month after month, "to ensure that we have a clear understanding of this issue and follow the Marxist-Leninist line." In this way, the important and complex problem of how to understand and handle class struggle in socialist society is once again forcefully and extremely simply placed before the whole Party. In socialist society, class struggle within certain limits will still exist for a long time and may even intensify under certain conditions, but it is not the principal contradiction of socialism. However, since 1957, when the mistake of expanding the class struggle in the Anti-Rightist Struggle was made and the principal contradiction of socialist society was determined to be class contradiction, this erroneous understanding has continued to develop until the 8th Plenum of the 10th Central Committee further asserted that this principal contradiction exists before the advanced stage of socialism. This marks a further systematic development of the viewpoint of expanding the class struggle, and lays a theoretical foundation for the Party's "left" deviation from correctness on this issue. Just like the "Three Red Flags" in 1958, "taking class struggle as the key link" is indeed different from the Soviet model, but it also violates the correct direction of Marxist Chinese characteristics. What is more serious is that the establishment of this "key link" further weakened the Party's ability to correct mistakes and greatly increased the difficulty of returning Marxist Chinese characteristics to the correct direction.
After the 8th Plenum of the 10th Central Committee, a complex situation emerged in the entire Party and the whole country: on the one hand, the "left" deviation of expanding class struggle politically further developed; on the other hand, the tasks of economic adjustment and recovery could basically continue as planned. These two aspects were contradictory, but the contradiction was temporarily controlled within a certain range. It can be imagined that in such a pattern of contradiction, the more thorough the economic adjustment and the greater the achievements, the more the political "left" could develop and end this pattern of contradiction with a movement similar to the Anti-Rightist Struggle and the campaign against the "Great Leap Forward" in the 1950s.
Based on the analysis of the domestic class struggle situation at that time and the theory of the expansion of class struggle that continued to develop, the Central Committee of the Party decided to launch a widespread socialist education movement in both urban and rural areas. In the first half of 1963, Mao Zedong summarized and put forward the slogan "Class struggle: grasp it and it works," and decided to carry out a socialist education movement mainly focused on "the Four Cleans" in rural areas and launch the "Five Anti" movement in cities. By the spring of 1964, a large number of rural production brigades across the country had carried out the "Four Cleans," and a few cities had pilot projects for the "Five Anti" movement.
These "anti-revisionist" "major strategic measures" under the guidance of the "leftist" policy have in turn developed "leftist" theories. In the second half of 1963, the guideline of "making class struggle the main task" was clearly put forward: in the first half of 1964, it was estimated that about one-third of the leadership of grassroots units nationwide was not in our hands, but in the hands of the enemy and its allies. By the second half of 1964, tasks such as "seizing power" were proposed, considering that the main danger at the time was right-wing deviation, and further development of "leftist" errors. At the Central Work Conference held at the end of 1964 and the beginning of 1965, although some overly "leftist" practices in various local movements were partially corrected, it was emphasized that the nature of the movement was to resolve the contradictions between socialism and capitalism, and the focus of the movement was to "completely rectify those within the party who take the capitalist road". This concentrated the struggle on party leaders at all levels and led the "leftist" thought of expanding the class struggle to a new stage, creating an artificial and systematic stage of so-called "class struggle".
At the same time, excessive and erroneous criticisms and struggles were launched in the ideological field. In December 1963 and June 1964, Mao Zedong criticized in two instructions concerning the literary and art circles that "many communists enthusiastically advocate feudalism and capitalism in art, but are not enthusiastic about advocating socialist art", and "in recent years, they have even come to the brink of revisionism. If we do not earnestly transform, we will inevitably eventually become groups like the Hungarian Petofi Club." With the promotion of these two instructions, the criticism in the literary and art circles escalated since 1964 and quickly expanded to the academic and educational fields. With the development of the excessive criticism in these fields, the "Hundred Flowers Campaign" suffered serious damage, and the majority of intellectuals became alarmed and insecure. Many adjustments in the cultural fields in the early 1960s were forced to be interrupted.
After the 10th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, although there was a resurgence of "leftist" errors in politics and ideology, it had not yet become the dominant error before the launch of the "Cultural Revolution". The main attention of the whole Party and the people still focused on the adjustment of the national economy, the recovery and development of production. Since 1963, the national economic situation began to improve comprehensively. By 1965, after five years of adjustment, the production of industry and agriculture had been restored and developed, market supply had been improved, national prices were stable, the market was prosperous, and the adjustment tasks were successfully completed. At the Third National People's Congress held at the end of 1964 and the beginning of 1965, Premier Zhou Enlai announced on behalf of the central government: our national economy is about to enter a new stage of development, the third five-year plan will be implemented in 1966, and the whole nation should strive and work hard to gradually build our country into a socialist power with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern defense, and modern science and technology.
From the completion of the three major transformations to 1966, the Party's guiding ideology had two development trends. One was the correct and relatively correct trend, the other was the incorrect trend. Any trend that was correct could relatively correctly understand China's national conditions, promote its contemporization in the process of Marxist sinicization, and adapt to the significant changes in the international environment and the needs of contemporary socialist development. Any trend that violated these two principles would inevitably form an erroneous trend. However, whether correct or incorrect, both trends were the result of exploring the process of Marxist sinicization and prepared the conditions for ultimately achieving sinicization.
In the course of ten years, the accumulation and development of "leftist" mistakes eventually temporarily overwhelmed the correct developmental trend, leading to the initiation of the "Cultural Revolution".

Chapter 9 The Fate of the Sinicization of Marxism in the "Cultural Revolution"
In 1966, with the completion of the task of adjusting the national economy, our country began to implement the third five-year plan for the national economy, entering a new period of development in economic construction. Overcoming the severe difficulties in the national economy, the vast number of cadres and masses were full of confidence, working hard and ardently hoping for faster economic development. However, it was precisely at this time that the "Cultural Revolution" erupted.
"The Cultural Revolution" was a serious "left" deviation that occurred during the exploration of China's own path to socialist construction by the Communist Party of China, under the banner of defending and developing Marxism. It was the result of the strong desire for the sinicization of Marxism going astray.
"The Cultural Revolution" was a negation of certain policies and theories since the founding of New China, especially since the adjustments made in the 1960s. It was a result of the Chinese Communist Party deviating from the combination of basic Marxist principles and the Chinese reality during the process of socialist construction. It also represented a distorted response to contemporary socialist reforms and the global trend of modernization. This response was erroneous, but it reflected a certain ideological trend and practice in the process of global modernization in a very typical way.
In the political report of the 9th National Congress of the Party, which declared the "comprehensive victory" of the Cultural Revolution, it emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism goes towards comprehensive collapse and socialism achieves victory worldwide. It stated that Mao Zedong Thought "combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of revolution, inheriting, defending, and developing Marxism-Leninism in various fields such as politics, military, economy, culture, and philosophy, and elevating Marxism-Leninism to a new stage." The report also believed that the theory of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" laid the theoretical foundation for this proletarian cultural revolution. In fact, the "theory" on which Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution distorted the scientific connotation of Mao Zedong Thought. It not only deviated from the basic principles of Marxism but also seriously departed from China's national conditions and the correct direction of the sinicization of Marxism.
I. A socialist perspective and the launching of the Cultural Revolution.
"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" was initiated and led by Mao Zedong. For Mao, this was an attempt to seek a socialist development path different from the traditional Soviet model, a response to the shortcomings of contemporary capitalist modernization, and an answer to the questions of "what is socialism" and "how to build socialism" in the conditions of the 1960s. It was also a significant effort by Mao to further promote the sinicization of Marxism under new historical conditions. "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" deviated from the trend of contemporary world modernization, causing serious disasters to the development of the Party and the country, and leading the process of sinicization of Marxism astray.
1. The Radical World and China
"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" is a product of a socialist perspective, which is closely related to the "leftist" and radical tendencies in the global situation of the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, China had a classic summary of the development and changes in the world situation: great upheaval, great polarization, and great reorganization. Over forty years have passed, and looking back now, this summary is still quite fitting. At that time, although there were varying degrees of radicalization and conservatism in different regions, countries, groups, or camps in the world, overall, radicalization was still dominant.
Since the 1950s, armed struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and the struggle for national independence and liberation, have emerged and intensified in Third World countries, with one success after another, one wave higher than the other. The international order of old colonialism collapsed, and there were numerous contradictions within the capitalist camp. For Third World countries, the 1960s was a period of rising revolutionary movements against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and hegemony. Armed uprisings, guerrilla wars, military coups, foreign interventions, bloody killings, and political turmoil marked this decade. In the 1960s, the national liberation movements of the Third World reached their climax in the 20th century, essentially accomplishing the mission of national liberation and independence.
After the Second World War, developed capitalist countries adapted to the needs of the new technological revolution to varying degrees through their own adjustments, easing or delaying economic crises. Productivity experienced rapid development, leading to a "golden era" of development in some major capitalist countries. The majority of workers, farmers, and intellectuals became beneficiaries of this prosperity, and class contradictions in the Western world were alleviated. However, with the development of various shortcomings in the process of capitalist modernization, left-wing ideology, student movements, and movements against racial discrimination also emerged. In particular, after the escalation of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, widespread anti-war movements in Western developed countries reached unprecedented heights, dealing heavy blows to the governments of various countries, led by the United States. In 1968, student protests erupted globally, from countries in the Western world, such as the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, to socialist countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Young people were no longer willing to passively accept material affluence, expressing dissatisfaction, anger, and rebellion against the deformities of capitalist modernization, such as the expanding material desires, moral decay, domination of instrumental rationality, and repression of individuality. Mao Zedong's ideas gained great prestige among left-wing intellectuals in the West. In April 1969, the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China stated in its political report that an unprecedented revolutionary movement had broken out in the heartland of capitalism, including Japan, Western Europe, and North America, and more and more people were awakening.
Compared to the radicalization of the left in the Third World and Western developed countries at the time, socialist countries exhibited a tendency towards conservatism due to the lag in reforms. After the Second World War, a powerful socialist camp emerged for a time. The great achievements made by socialist countries in eliminating exploitation, developing their economies, promoting equality, and defending peace greatly inspired progressive forces worldwide while causing unease among imperialists and reactionary forces. Starting from the mid-1950s, within the international communist movement, a comprehensive reflection on the Stalinist model had begun, and most socialist countries had also started reforming the Soviet model. These reforms temporarily injected vitality into the political and economic aspects of socialist countries but inevitably led to different understandings and practices of reform due to their respective historical traditions, geopolitical factors, national conditions, different interpretations of Marxism, and rigid political systems. Consequently, divisions, differentiation, and even splits emerged within the socialist camp. It must be said that these debates, divisions, and differentiations are unavoidable in the process of contemporary socialist development. They not only caused losses to the contemporary international communist movement but also stimulated the development of socialist theory and practice. Regardless of the achievements, twists, and turns of socialist countries, as well as the achievements and maintenance of various worker parties and communist parties on a global scale, they all reflect the historical inevitability of the socialist movement's transition from classics to modernity.
Leaders such as Khrushchev and Brezhnev in the Soviet Union conducted some beneficial attempts and achieved certain results in unprecedented reforms. However, due to historical limitations, there were also twists and setbacks. Particularly noteworthy is that these reforms, although still in their early stages, represented a certain degree of negation of the existing model and traditional concepts. For socialist countries with relatively developed economies, mature material conditions, and higher levels of socialization, this negation was a relatively natural historical process. However, for countries with relatively backward productivity, for countries with the primary task of rapidly developing their economies under new systems, and for parties that had just ended large-scale revolutionary wars and were still maintaining intense mass class struggle movements, it was difficult to understand and accept reform practices that were different from classical theory and war experience.
After Stalin's death, the Soviet Union's great power and great party chauvinism once showed some convergence, but it soon resurfaced and became more intense, causing dissatisfaction and opposition among socialist countries and parties. Due to differences in reform issues and the actions of Soviet chauvinism and hegemonism, the relationship between the Chinese and Soviet parties continued to deteriorate, leading to a worldwide debate in the early 1960s. Mao Zedong believed that the Soviet party had been "peacefully transformed" into a revisionist party and had betrayed the international communist cause. Parties in Europe, Asia, South America, and elsewhere were also undergoing or in the process of undergoing similar changes. These changes in some parties, including the Soviet Union, were not accidental, but the result of the combined efforts of the new bourgeoisie and international imperialist forces within their own countries. If China did not timely fight against modern revisionism and the "peaceful transformation" by imperialism, the tragedy that occurred in the Soviet Union could also happen in China. In the first half of 1966, Mao Zedong mentioned several times that the majority of parties in the world were veering towards revisionism. In a letter in July of the same year, he wrote with a heavy heart that the majority of the more than 100 parties in the world no longer believed in Marxism-Leninism, and Marx and Lenin had been crushed by people. This reflects his view on the profound changes occurring in the entire socialist movement and ideology at that time.
After the 1960s, significant changes occurred in China's international environment. The United States and the Soviet Union, the two superpowers, exerted pressure on China from the north and south, even resorting to blatant war threats. This situation caused Mao Zedong to develop a severe sense of crisis. He repeatedly raised questions to the entire party about whether imperialism would attack China and whether China faced the danger of being conquered. This concern was not unwarranted. However, when pondering this question, he did not pay enough attention to the changes in the economic and political situation of capitalist countries after the war, the new characteristics of world economic development, the rise of the new technological revolution, and the new trends and features in the development of the world situation caused by it. Starting from some conclusions of Marx and Lenin on war and revolution, he believed that war and revolution were still the main features of the current era. Either revolution would prevent war or war would lead to revolution. He urged the entire party not to be afraid of war, to be prepared for early and large-scale warfare, to be prepared for Americans to attack, and to be prepared for revisionists to attack. He overestimated the urgency of a world war and the possibility of a world revolution triggered by such a war. This estimate filled him with confidence and optimism about the future of the world revolution, but also caused him to worry about the national security of a country under the pressure of the two superpowers.
The global revolutionary situation and the rise of left-wing movements and ideologies against imperialism and colonialism in the 1960s, the twists and stagnation in reforms in socialist countries, and the sense of urgency for an imminent war profoundly influenced the views of our party and national leaders on the world situation, the future of socialism, and the development trends of contemporary Marxism. This, in turn, deeply affected the views on domestic situations and the direction of domestic policies.
2. "What is socialism?"
The three major transformations in 1956 had just been completed, and Mao Zedong had already put forward the task of reforming the Soviet model. He proposed to the whole party that China's socialist construction should start from its own national conditions, liberate the mind, learn from the Soviet experience, develop and advance based on Marxism. This understanding reflected the common aspirations of some socialist countries at that time and embodied the correct direction of socialist reform in those countries. However, after solving this problem, another more complex and arduous task was placed before people: how to liberate the mind and go beyond the Soviet model? What should socialism pursue? How should the process of sinicizing Marxism be carried out? How can we explore a socialist path that not only conforms to the basic principles of Marxism but also suits the national conditions of China? It is not simply by negating the Soviet model that we can embark on the road of reform. In the process of reforming the Soviet model, socialist countries have taken a tortuous path, made tremendous efforts, and even paid heavy costs. In order to explore this path, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists have devoted great efforts and have taken a tortuous development path. The "Great Leap Forward" was not successful, but it reflected a strong desire to go beyond the Soviet model. The movement to establish people's communes had a strong Chinese character, but it was not Marxist. The "Cultural Revolution" was completely wrong and far from the Soviet model.
In addition to in-depth observation of the Soviet socialist practice experience and profound understanding of the national conditions, the successful reform of the Soviet model also requires the liberation of the mind, the promotion of the development and modernization of Marxism based on the rich practice of the international communist movement for decades and the great changes of the times. At the same time, it is also necessary to have a profound and comprehensive grasp of contemporary capitalism, the trends of the times and their development. Particularly important is that successful reform also requires a certain level of development of socialized production and commodity economy in the country, that is to say, the material foundation requires a certain degree of development. Just as in a country where small peasant economy is the majority, the understanding, attention and application of the law of value, modern management, modern credit system, etc. are far from comparable to that of a developed industrialized country. The observations and understandings of the shortcomings of the Soviet model often have many obvious differences between developed and underdeveloped countries.
Among Mao Zedong's ideological resources for reforming the Soviet model, in addition to his observations and contemplations on the Soviet revolutionary and construction practices, there are also some unique understandings of the basic principles of Marxism formed in his long-term revolutionary struggle, various descriptions of the utopian world in Chinese history, and the imprint of his early revolutionary activities in "Xin Cun", as well as the influence of the rich and successful military communist practice experience during the period of China's revolutionary war. It is the interaction of these material and ideological conditions that determined many characteristics of China's reform at that time. Although the "Great Leap Forward" carried a strong desire to go beyond the Soviet model, many of its contents often went against the direction of contemporary socialist development. For example, it overlooked the role of economic laws in socialist construction; it was unfamiliar with and underestimated modern management, institutions, and legal systems; it worried that commodity economy and labor distribution under socialist conditions might produce "bourgeois rights"; it advocated using mass movements and even military communism to conduct economic construction; it had deep concerns about the possibility of "bourgeois" and "revisionism" arising from material interests, and believed that a simple and not affluent life could generate and maintain sufficient revolutionary spirit, and this spirit in turn could provide strong momentum for socialist development, and so on.
The adjustment since the early 1960s is not only a restoration of the traditional model but also a certain degree of reform. Comparatively realistic adjustments and explorations quickly achieved a batch of initial results. More importantly, these efforts reflected a new understanding of socialism in different aspects. However, under the background of limited progress in the modernization of Marxism, slow-paced reforms in socialist countries, and the lagging economic conditions in China, people's understanding of the basic question of "what is socialism" at that time was still restricted to a certain extent. The adjustment in the political and political system lagged behind the economic adjustment environment, and many factors in the international situation at that time, making the conditions for comprehensive socialist reform in China not yet mature. As a result, the contradictions between the new understanding and measures of socialism generated during the adjustment period and traditional socialist concepts deepened and developed. Since 1964, Mao Zedong increasingly sharply pointed out the problem of revisionism within the Central Committee to the whole Party. This concern reflected some contradictions between socialism in practice in our country at that time and the socialism in Mao Zedong's ideals at a deep level, as well as some contradictions between the socialist reforms being carried out worldwide and the socialism in Mao Zedong's ideals at that time.
On May 7, 1966, on the eve of the launch of the "Cultural Revolution," Mao Zedong once again systematically talked about his basic views on socialism in his instructions to Lin Biao in a report (the "Five Seven Instructions"). He said:
The army should be a big school. This big school, apart from fighting, can also do various work. This was what our various anti-Japanese base areas did during the eight years of the Second World War. In this big school, politics, military, and culture are studied, and it can also engage in agricultural and sideline production, can also run some small and medium-sized factories, producing several products needed by itself and products that can be exchanged with the state at equivalent value, and can also engage in mass work and participate in the movement to clear away the remnants of the exploiting classes in factories and rural areas. After the movement to clear away the remnants of the exploiting classes is completed, there is always mass work that can be done so that the military and the people are always united, and they must also be prepared to participate in the struggle of the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie at any time. In this way, military education, military industry, and military and civilian aspects can all be combined. However, appropriate adjustments need to be made, there must be a main focus and secondary focuses, and among the three aspects of agriculture, industry, and people, a military unit can only focus on one or two aspects and cannot simultaneously focus on all of them. In this way, the role played by several million troops is very significant.
He believed that workers are also like this, with work as the main focus, but they should also study military affairs, politics, and culture, engage in the movement to clear away the remnants of the exploiting classes, and participate in the struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie. In places where conditions permit, they should also engage in agricultural and sideline production, such as the Daqing oilfield. Farmers, with agriculture as the main focus (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishing), should also study military affairs, politics, and culture, and when conditions permit, they should also collectively operate small factories and criticize the bourgeoisie. Students are also like this, with study as the main focus, but they should also study other things, not only literature but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and they should also criticize the bourgeoisie. The length of schooling should be shortened, education should be revolutionary, and the phenomenon of the bourgeoisie intellectuals ruling our schools should no longer continue. For those in the commercial, service industry, and party and government institutions who have the conditions, they should also do the same.
Finally, Mao Zedong pointed out that what has been said above is not new opinions or creative inventions. Many people have been doing this for many years, but it has not been popularized yet. As for the military, they have been doing this for decades, but now they need to further develop it.
Mao Zedong's opinions reflect some of his basic ideas about socialism at that time. These ideas were to some extent manifested in the Great Leap Forward and the movement for the People's Communes. In the subsequent adjustment period, Mao Zedong further contemplated the question of "what is socialism" based on his summary and reflection of the experiences of 1958. He abandoned some unrealistic ideas from the Great Leap Forward and developed a long-term understanding of socialist revolution and construction. As the differences of opinions within the party on socialist construction deepened and the erroneous development of the expansion of class struggle, Mao Zedong continuously added the content of class struggle to his socialist construction concept. These new developments are well demonstrated in some important documents before the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, such as the May 16th Notification and the May 7th Directive.
In some important aspects, the May 7th Directive has many similarities with the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes. It reflects some important features of socialism that Mao Zedong yearned for and aspired to. This kind of socialism is "based on class struggle," it takes class struggle as the driving force and guarantee for economic construction and social development. For individual producers, class consciousness and revolutionary spirit serve as the overwhelming source of motivation. In this society, every member of society engages in both industry and agriculture, both literature and martial arts, and is self-sufficient or semi-self-sufficient economically. Regarding commodity production, although it is necessary to use it for economic development, it must be restricted due to its bourgeois nature. Although social division of labor is necessary for current production, it must also be restricted because it leads to inequality in the production process. Conditions should be created to gradually narrow this inequality. In the realm of distribution, differences should also be reduced, and even a system of rough equality can be implemented. Because material interests will always arouse people's material desires, which directly threaten the purity and nobility of morality, and even lead to spiritual degeneration. Revolutionary ideals and class consciousness can provide the most powerful and lasting motivation, enabling workers to willingly complete any arduous physical or mental labor. This kind of society may not be so affluent, but that may be its superiority, because in a prosperous or highly prosperous society, people often pay the price of spiritual degeneration, will depression, and the degeneration of socialism...
Mao Zedong's understanding of socialism includes not only some of the ideas about the future society by Marxist classic writers over a hundred years ago, but also his transcendent consciousness of the shortcomings of the Soviet model. It encompasses the profound imprint of the construction experience in revolutionary base areas and military communism during the revolutionary war period, as well as the far-reaching influence of Chinese cultural traditions. The socialist model showcased in the "Five Seven Instruction" contains some bold concepts and imaginative foresight, reflecting sharp criticism of the drawbacks of contemporary capitalist modernization and embodying an idealistic pursuit. However, overall, it is unrealistic. It overlooks the decisive role of the level of productive forces in determining a social form, deviates from the theme of developing productive forces during the socialist period, and neglects the important significance of a commodity economy for socialist development. It treats class struggle, which exists in a residual form, as the primary contradiction of socialism, hoping to achieve victory over the bourgeoisie through uninterrupted class struggle and restrictions on division of labor, differences, and material interests. These ideas have shades of empiricism and utopianism. Mao Zedong's proposed concepts, as he himself said, had already been implemented in the anti-Japanese base areas, with the army having done so for decades. However, he seemed to have not paid attention to whether effective experiences during the revolutionary war period, which were correct practices in the military, can be unconditionally promoted to the whole society, especially to comprehensive socialist construction. Socialism needs development and reform, but it must be based on the current state and development of productive forces. Socialist construction must promote the revolutionary traditions and heroic spirit of the war years, but it cannot simply be directly copied. The basic principles of Marxism cannot be violated, but they must also develop continuously along with the progress of the times, and the correctness of this development must be tested by practice.
On May 15th, the Central Committee of the Party forwarded this letter to the entire Party. The forwarding directive pointed out that the "Five Seven Instruction" is a "new development of Marxist-Leninist epoch-making significance". On August 1st, in celebration of the 39th anniversary of the founding of the army, the People's Daily published an editorial titled "The Whole Nation Should Become a University of Mao Zedong Thought - In Commemoration of the 39th Anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army". The editorial announced part of the content of the "Five Seven Instruction" and gave it high praise:
"The idea proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong that each industry should be run as a revolutionary university that combines work and agriculture, culture and military is our program. By doing as Comrade Mao Zedong said, we can greatly enhance the proletarian consciousness of the people of our country, promote the revolutionization of their thinking," "we can promote the gradual narrowing of the gap between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and physical and mental labor," "we can realize the universal Armed Forces," "the 700 million people of our country will all become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world. They can work with hammers, do farming with hoes, fight enemies with guns, and write articles with pens. In this way, the whole country will become a university of Mao Zedong Thought and a university of communism."
The basic ideas and some specific requirements in the "Five Seven Instruction" began to be comprehensively implemented in the "struggle, critique, and reform" movement that started in 1969. It penetrated into almost all departments and fields, manifested in countless experiments, typologies, and dazzling movements. This understanding of socialism and the divergences within the Party it caused became important reasons for launching the "Cultural Revolution". The pursuit of this socialist model became an important content of the "Cultural Revolution". Under such a socialist standard, the number of class enemies could only increase, the danger of capitalist restoration could only become more severe, and the expansion and intensification of class struggle could only escalate.
3. The Delay of the Modernization of Marxism and the Mistaken Judgment of the World and National Situation
Against the backdrop of revolutionary changes in international economy and politics, Marxism itself is also confronted with the urgent task of modernization, that is, how to adapt to the developed global situation and the characteristics of different countries. This requires both upholding the basic principles of Marxism and abandoning some outdated conclusions that have been proven by practice, as well as adding new content to the development of Marxism. Without such efforts of modernization, to be precise, without correct efforts of modernization, Marxism will lag behind the times, and the desire for the sinicization of Marxism will also come to naught.
During the democratic revolution, Mao Zedong was firmly against dogmatism. It was precisely in the process of opposing the dogmatization of Marxism that he put forward the scientific proposition of sinicizing Marxism, established Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved the first historical leap of the sinicization of Marxism. After the start of the comprehensive construction of socialism, despite the strong desire to develop Marxism and promote the sinicization of Marxism, due to the lag in the modernization of Marxism on a global scale and the limitations of China's specific national conditions, there emerged within the party a tendency not to base socialist construction on the specific circumstances of China, but to guide it solely by some dogmatized conclusions or misinterpreted principles. For example, starting from the imaginations of classical writers about the future society, they greatly underestimated the long-term nature of socialist society and the fundamental significance of developing productive forces for the Chinese revolution and construction. During the "Great Leap Forward" and the people's communes movement, they took the descriptions of future society by classical writers as the basis for their attitudes towards issues such as "communes" and "bourgeoisie rights." In the period of economic readjustment, some distorted statements of classical writers were taken as the starting point, and some effective adjustment measures were regarded as revisionism or capitalist elements, which then influenced the judgment of the national and party situations and further escalated class struggle. In the great debate of the international communist movement launched in the 1960s, this tendency of dogmatism further developed. For example, in the "Recommendations on the General Line of the International Communist Movement" in June 1963, it was considered that "before entering the advanced stage of communist society, it is the period of transition from capitalism to communism and the period of proletarian dictatorship." This confused the understanding of the transition from the new democratic to socialist society and the transition from capitalist society to socialist society as two different stages of social development, and so on.
For example, starting from some statements made by classical Marxist writers over a hundred years ago, they neglected the enormous changes in the post-war world situation and lagged behind the times in understanding contemporary capitalism and socialism, the transition from capitalism to socialism, the characteristics of the times, and how to treat war and peace, among other major issues. Therefore, when leaders of countries like the Soviet Union put forward ideas such as "peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, and peaceful transition" in light of the changes in the world situation after World War II, they faced severe criticism from us. The Communist Party of China believed that the current world was still in the era of Lenin's imperialism and proletarian revolution, that is, the era of "world capitalism and imperialism leading to destruction, and socialism and communism leading to victory." Moreover, "the overall trend of the current world is still as Chairman Mao said: 'The enemy is getting worse day by day, while we are getting better day by day.'" These kinds of judgments reflecting the understanding of the era and the world situation were continuously reinforced during the "Cultural Revolution" and were written into the preface of the widely circulated "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and the party constitution passed at the Ninth Party Congress. The serious divergence on the issue of the times also gave rise to other contradictions.
In the context of the overall backwardness of Marxism modernization, different degrees and forms of doctrinairism have not only developed the internal divisions and contradictions within the international communist movement, but also affected the formulation of domestic policies and the judgment of the international situation, becoming another important reason for the launch of the "Cultural Revolution".
4. The Development of the Error Theory and Practice of Expanding Class Struggle
The Communist Party of China entered the socialist society after a long period of revolutionary war. Influenced by the intense tradition, experience, and habitual power of class struggle, Mao Zedong changed the Communist Party's Eighth National Congress' judgment on the principal contradiction in socialist society after the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, which became the starting point and theoretical source for the continuous development of the Party's error in expanding class struggle. During the Lu Mountain Conference in 1959, Mao Zedong not only initiated a wrongful criticism of Peng Dehuai but also referred to this struggle as "a class struggle" and "the continuation of the life and death struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat", thus leading the class struggle into the Party. This was another serious escalation of the expansion of class struggle. At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, Mao Zedong further treated some differences in understanding within the Party as a reflection of class struggle within the Party, expanding and absolutizing the class struggle that existed within a certain scope in socialist society. He further asserted that the transitional period of class struggle as the principal contradiction should extend until the arrival of the advanced stage of communism. This later became known as the Party's "basic theory" and in the "Cultural Revolution" as the "Party's basic line during the entire socialist historical stage". This marked the further systemization of the viewpoint on the expansion of class struggle. From 1963 to 1965, the guideline of "making class struggle the key link" was put forward in the Socialist Education Movement. In January 1965, the "23 Articles", presided over by Mao Zedong, emphasized that the nature of this movement was to resolve the contradictions between socialism and capitalism, and the focus of the movement was "to rectify those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road". This focused the struggle on Party leaders at all levels, thus causing the "left" inclined thought of expanding class struggle to the stage of artificially, arbitrarily, and systematically creating so-called "class struggle", becoming the main basis for launching the "Cultural Revolution" and proposing the theory of "continuing revolutionary under proletarian dictatorship".
Based on this kind of theory, Mao Zedong continuously escalated the error in his judgment on domestic and internal political situations, as well as the main tasks. By the eve of the "Cultural Revolution" in 1966, he gradually formed a relatively systematic view on launching the "Cultural Revolution". He believed that a large number of representatives of the bourgeoisie and revisionist elements had infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural fields and that the leadership of a significant majority of units was no longer in the hands of Marxists and the masses. The capitalist-roaders within the Party have formed a command center in the central government, with a revisionist political line and organizational line, and they have agents in various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and central departments. The various struggles of the past have not been able to solve the problem, and only by carrying out a cultural revolution, openly, comprehensively, and from the bottom up, can the masses be mobilized to expose the aforementioned dark side and regain the power usurped by the capitalist-roaders. This is essentially a political revolution in which one class overthrows another, and there will be many to follow. Mao Zedong systematized and standardized the theory of launching the "Cultural Revolution" in this way. This relatively systematic theory of "continuing revolution" became the theoretical basis for launching the "Cultural Revolution".
In the mid-1960s, during the process of correcting the mistakes of the "Great Leap Forward" movement and adjusting the national economy in China, on one hand, the economic adjustment and recovery tasks continued according to the original plan. On the other hand, politically, the "left" deviation which was mainly characterized by the expansion of class struggle continued to develop. However, until the launch of the "Cultural Revolution," it had not reached the degree of dominating the overall situation. Within the party, the two trends of development during the exploration of China's own path to socialism since the Eighth Party Congress were intertwined and permeated each other, while contradictions also developed. Ultimately, due to the influence of the dogmatic understanding of Marxism at the time and institutional factors such as arbitrary decision-making, the tendency of "left" deviation temporarily overwhelmed the correct trend of development, leading to the launch of the "Cultural Revolution."
Under the guidance of the ideology of "class struggle as the central task," our country, led and initiated by the leader of the party, Mao Zedong, experienced a decade-long, tenacious "Cultural Revolution" from 1966 to 1976. Its main form was to overthrow the "capitalist roaders within the party" and it brought serious disasters to the party, the country, and the people.
II. Theory and Practice of "Continuing the Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
1. The formation and content of the theory of "continuing the revolution."
The theory of "continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" (abbreviated as the "continuing revolution" theory), as the guiding ideology and fundamental theory of the "Cultural Revolution", was written into the political reports and party constitution passed at the 9th and 10th Party Congresses, and was enshrined in the constitution passed by the 4th National People's Congress. It is hailed as the "third great milestone in the development of Marxism". At that time, the main aspect of the theory was understood as "the theoretical and practical resolution of the most significant issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration in contemporary Marxist development". History has proven that the "continuing revolution" theory deviates from the fundamental principles of Marxism and the Chinese national conditions, and has caused serious setbacks to the process of sinofication of Marxism, bringing great disaster to the Party, the country, and the entire Chinese people.
The theory of "continuing revolution" is an overall summary of the "leftist" errors in the class struggle under socialist society that have continually developed since the anti-rightist struggle of 1957. Before the "Cultural Revolution", this theory was still in its infancy, brewing and preliminary development stages. In terms of Mao Zedong's overall thinking and activities, the errors in this issue were still localized. After the "Cultural Revolution" was fully launched, the main argument of this "theory" was basically formed, and it occupied a dominant position in Mao Zedong's thinking and activities during this period. The Party's 11th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee stated: Mao Zedong's series of instructions on the "Cultural Revolution" "is a major development of Marxism-Leninism," "Comrade Mao Zedong's comprehensive inheritance, defense, and development of Marxism-Leninism, has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new stage". On May 18, 1967, the article "Great Historical Documents" in the editorial offices of "Red Flag" and "People's Daily" first proposed the concept of "revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" and referred to it as the "third great milestone in the development of Marxism". In the 9th issue of "Red Flag" in 1967, the editorial referred to the evaluation of this theory as the "illustrious theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat". In the article "Long Live the Cultural Revolution under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published on October 1, 1967 in the editorial offices of "People's Daily," "Red Flag," and the "Liberation Army Daily," it developed into the "illustrious theory of continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat". Finally, on November 6, 1967, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and "Liberation Army Daily" published an editorial titled "Advancing Along the Road Opened Up by the October Socialist Revolution - Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," officially naming it the "theory of continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" and summarizing its main content into six points, accompanied by a detailed and authoritative explanation. This article, drafted by Chen Boda and Yao Wenyuan and approved by Mao Zedong personally, gave a very high evaluation of this theory. "Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, creatively put forward the great theory of continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and personally initiated and led the great practice of the world's first proletarian cultural revolution. This is a significant milestone in the development of Marxism, marking the stage of Mao Zedong Thought as an extremely significant leap forward"; the theory of continuing revolution "genius and creatively developed the idea of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and has epoch-making significance. In the history of the development of Marxism, it establishes the third great milestone." It also states, "The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up the road for the proletariat to seize power," and "China's proletarian cultural revolution opened up the road to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and move towards communism. Its basic experience reflects the general laws of class struggle in the historical stage of transition to communism after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat." The article also believes that the focus of world revolution has gradually shifted to China, where "Mao Zedong thought" emerged.
The Ninth National Congress of the Party further stated that this "theory" is a great new contribution to the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. According to this theory, the "Cultural Revolution" launched was "completely necessary and very timely". Kang Sheng also elaborated on this. He believed that Mao Zedong developed the theory of continuous revolution of Marxism, not only proposing the theory of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, but also creating the form of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship - the proletarian cultural revolution. 
On March 18, 1971, to commemorate the centenary of the Paris Commune, the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily jointly published a editorial titled "Long Live the Victory of Proletarian Dictatorship". It once again expounded on the main content and significance of the theory of "continuing revolution". The editorial pointed out that the focus of the struggle between Marxism and revisionism, as well as various bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideologies, is whether to adhere to using revolutionary violence to smash the state machinery of the bourgeoisie and establish proletarian dictatorship, or to maintain the state machinery of the bourgeoisie and oppose proletarian dictatorship. The acquisition of political power by the proletariat does not mean the end of socialist revolution, but the beginning of socialist revolution. In order to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration, the proletariat must not only carry out socialist revolution on the economic front, but also carry out socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, including implementing comprehensive dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in various cultural fields in the superstructure, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. The editorial highly praised the theory of "continuing revolution", stating that "Chairman Mao comprehensively summed up the historical experience of the positive and negative aspects of proletarian dictatorship, inherited, defended, and developed the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship of Marxism-Leninism, and put forward the great theory of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. It has theoretically and practically solved the most significant question of consolidating proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration in contemporary times, made a great new contribution to Marxism-Leninism, and opened up the victorious path of carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end."
In the later stage of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong further developed this theory and raised theoretical issues related to socialism and proletarian dictatorship. On October 20, 1974, Mao Zedong, when meeting with Danish Prime Minister Paul Hartling, said: "In summary, China belongs to a socialist country. Before the liberation, it was similar to capitalism. We still have the eight-grade wage system, labor distribution, and currency exchange, which are not much different from the old society. The difference lies in the change of ownership." In February 1975, People's Daily published a editorial titled "Good Understanding of the Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship," which revealed the content of a conversation by Mao Zedong. It pointed out: "Why did Lenin say it is necessary to have dictatorship of the bourgeoisie? This question needs to be clarified. If this question is not clarified, it can lead to revisionism... China currently implements the commodity system and the wage system is also unequal, with an eight-grade wage system, and so on. This can only be restricted under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, if someone like Lin Biao comes to power, it is easy to implement the capitalist system." Mao Zedong believed that systems such as labor distribution and commodity exchange, which are formally equal but actually unequal, continuously give rise to capitalism and revisionism. This became an important reason for launching the Cultural Revolution and served as the theoretical basis for him to implement a series of "leftist" policies in economic policy. In fact, these understandings contain not only misunderstandings of the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but also dogmatic interpretations of certain contents, displaying a significant one-sidedness. Shortly after Mao Zedong's instructions on theoretical issues were released, People's Daily published a collection of quotations titled "Marx, Engels, Lenin on Dictatorship of the Proletariat," edited by Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. This sparked the nationwide movement to study the theory of proletarian dictatorship. Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao also wrote two articles respectively: "On the Social Basis of the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique" and "On the Comprehensive Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie." The core content was the discussion on the "theory of comprehensive dictatorship," which completely blurred the rich content of Marxist theory on proletarian dictatorship and distorted the essence and tasks of socialism.
2. The key points and core of the theory of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat"
According to the summary in the article "Advancing Along the Path Opened Up by the October Socialist Revolution," the main arguments of the theory of "continuing the revolution" are as follows:
First, it is necessary to observe socialist society with the laws of dialectical materialism of Marxism-Leninism.
Second, socialist society is a relatively long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. The struggle between socialism and capitalism, as well as the danger of capitalist restoration, still exist. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in terms of ideology are still long, tortuous, and sometimes even intense. In order to prevent capitalist restoration, in order to prevent "peaceful evolution," we must carry the socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front to the end.
Third, the class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, in essence, is still a question of political power. It is the bourgeoisie who wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the proletariat must vigorously consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat must exercise comprehensive dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including various cultural fields.
Fourth, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads in society will inevitably be reflected within the Party. A small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party. They are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the timing is ripe, they will try to seize power and transform the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In order to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must be fully aware of their true nature, fully expose and criticize them, confront them, so that they cannot overturn the situation, and firmly retrieve the power they have seized back into the hands of the proletariat.
Fifth, the most important aspect of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is to launch the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
The sixth fundamental principle of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" in the field of ideology. It is necessary to criticize revisionism politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and use the proletarian ideology to overcome bourgeois egoism and all non-proletarian ideologies. It is necessary to reform education, literature and art, and all superstructures that are not compatible with the socialist economic foundation, and uproot the roots of revisionism.
From the above six points, it can be seen that the core of the theory of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" is: under the condition that the proletariat has obtained political power and established the socialist system, it is necessary to carry out a revolution in which one class overthrows another class. The "Cultural Revolution" is the most important way of "continuing the revolution". 
From the basic content of the theory of "continuing the revolution", it can be seen that its main development of Marxism is actually a dogmatic interpretation and serious deviation from the basic theory of Marxism. At that time, this theory was regarded as the greatest achievement of Mao Zedong Thought, and it was believed that this achievement marked the new stage of the development of Mao Zedong Thought in Marxism, which was the "third milestone" after Leninism. In addition, talking about the "third milestone" of the development of Marx and Leninism in the world, without considering China's national conditions, the characteristics of the times, and the feelings of other socialist countries and communist parties, implies an intention to set standards and norms for people who are willing to accept Marxism worldwide. Therefore, the method used by this theory is also incorrect.
III. The theory of "continuing the revolution" in practice.
1. "The 'Thought Manifesto' of the 'Continuing Revolution' Theory - 'Struggle against Privatism, Criticize Revisionism'"
The "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" was hailed as a "revolution that touched people's souls", with "struggle against privatism, criticize revisionism" as the guiding ideology. According to the understanding at that time, "struggle against privatism" meant fighting against the "private" thoughts in one's own mind with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; "criticize revisionism" meant using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and to struggle against a small group of capitalist roaders within the party. The basis for this criticism was: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. This is the truth of revolution. Without using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize various anti-Marxist, revisionist reactionary thoughts, without criticizing the reactionary bourgeois worldview in the political, economic, and cultural fields, the proletariat cannot truly occupy all positions in the ideological and cultural fields; having already occupied them, if the revolution's mass criticism is not continued, these positions will be in danger of being recaptured by the bourgeoisie." Therefore, it was necessary to carry out large-scale, mass and long-lasting criticism of so-called revisionism and the bourgeoisie in the superstructure and ideology fields in order to prevent revisionism, overcome capitalism, transform worldviews, and develop productivity.
According to the Marxist point of view, transforming the subjective world not only involves transforming thoughts and consciousness, but also includes transforming and developing people's cognitive abilities. When dealing with ideological and cultural issues, and people's worldview issues, they must not be resolved through coercive methods, but rather through Marxist education and the development of scientific and cultural education, through criticism and self-criticism, and through people's practice. Mao Zedong himself also said: "Using crude methods and oppressive methods to deal with ideological problems is harmful and useless." However, for quite a long period after the founding of New China, when it came to transforming worldviews and the subjective world, it was equated with transforming the thoughts and consciousness of the bourgeoisie or non-proletarian class, while the issues of transforming cognitive abilities and thinking methods were neglected. As a result, the more transformations took place, the further away they drifted from Marxism. Especially during the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the so-called "struggle against privatism, criticize revisionism" either remained only in words or became muddled, confused right and wrong, engaged in arbitrary criticism and struggle, and had no connection with the ideological education work emphasized by Marxism. After ten years of turmoil, instead of overthrowing the old and establishing the new, it actually led to serious damage to our party's style and fine revolutionary traditions, a significant decline in political consciousness and moral standards, and the rampant spread of anarchism and extreme individualism.
During the Cultural Revolution, such "struggles" and "criticisms" almost involved all fields, both ancient and modern, domestic and foreign. It directly undermined various production activities, disrupted people's thinking, and at the same time, it comprehensively demonstrated a utopian and backward socialist view, the inevitable result of treating Marxism with empiricism and dogmatism, and showed unfamiliarity and ignorance towards the global modernization trend. For example, the "Sixty Articles on Agriculture" which stipulated that members should engage in small-scale self-sufficient farming, operate small-scale family sideline businesses, and sell a small amount of agricultural and sideline products were all criticized as "spontaneous capitalist tendencies"; surplus agricultural and sideline products sold by members in agricultural markets after fulfilling state tasks were criticized as "spontaneous actions" or "profiteering"; the calculation of work points based on labor contribution within the people's communes was criticized as "work points dominating"; the labor protection benefits for workers engaged in high-altitude, high-temperature, and underground operations in factories and mines were regarded as "material incentives" and reasonable subsidies such as additional salary and night shift allowance were canceled; the rules and regulations in factories and enterprises were criticized as "revisionist control, restriction, and pressure"; the pursuit of reasonable profit targets in enterprises was criticized as "profit domination". In schools, it was promoted to "thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois ideological system in various disciplines of humanities, such as philosophy, history, literature, political economy, journalism, and education" and claimed that the "old humanities universities" could only be regenerated through criticism, and so on.
Due to ignorance and nihilism towards all outstanding civilization achievements from ancient to modern times, there was also this kind of fanatic criticism in the field of natural sciences. This type of criticism was carried out multiple times after the founding of New China and reached its "peak" during the Cultural Revolution. For example, it was determined that since the establishment of New China for 17 years, the scientific and technological front had implemented a "thoroughly counter-revolutionary and revisionist research route" that abolished the leadership of the party, obliterated class struggle, opposed highlighting politics, advocated prioritizing expertise, and formulated a series of black program, black documents, and various rules and regulations, attempting to misguide China's scientific and technological undertakings; it was determined that the "Fourteen Articles on Scientific Research" formulated in 1961 concentratedly represented this "counter-revolutionary and revisionist research route"; it accused the statement in the "Fourteen Articles on Scientific Research" that said "do not label different schools of natural science and different propositions with class labels such as 'bourgeois', 'proletarian', 'capitalist', 'socialist'" and unreasonably claimed that the struggle between two worldviews reflected in the scientific and technological community was inevitable, not subject to human will, and branded this serious class struggle as "class labeling", attempting to reconcile this struggle, which is just whitewashing and absolutely unacceptable; it criticized the statement in the "Fourteen Articles on Scientific Research" that said "academic debates on issues in natural science", even those related to the debate between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics, were considered academic questions and declared that the debate between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics in the scientific and technological community was an ideological class struggle, and treating this struggle as an "academic question" was obliterating the class struggle between two classes.
The criticism of natural science itself is even more absurd. For example, it is claimed that the theory of relativity "is a prominent example of the penetration of bourgeois consciousness and the involvement in class struggle in natural scientific theories," and Einstein is the greatest "academic authority of bourgeois counter-reaction," "advocate of the capitalist system," "imperialist missionary," and "enemy of socialism." In an article criticizing the "Big Bang cosmology," it is said that this theory "essentially only caters to the needs of religion and complies with the needs of reactionary forces to numb the people spiritually." In an article titled "The Contradictory Struggle is the Driving Force of Chemical Science," it is said that the development of chemistry is full of the struggle between dialectics and metaphysics, and this philosophical struggle is the product of class struggle. In an article criticizing the assertion of environmental pollution and energy depletion, it is said that the root cause of environmental pollution "does not depend on industrial production itself, but on the social system, on the nature of production"; environmental pollution is "an innate abscess brought by capitalism from birth"; "there still exist two paths, two lines, and two worldviews in dealing with the problem of environmental pollution"; the energy crisis is a reflection of the "exhaustion" of the capitalist system, the "incurable disease" of capitalist society; the "energy crisis" "essentially is a crisis of the capitalist system, a sign of its decline, and another major exposure of its precarious situation." In the criticism of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, it is said that the debate surrounding quantum mechanics issues over the past half century is the manifestation of the struggle between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics in the field of physics; the Copenhagen school has become a reactionary and conservative trend, with political aims of promoting "unity of opposites" and class conciliation, attempting to save the dying capitalist system, "It is a product of the decayed, declining and dying imperialist system, serving reactionary politics." Therefore, it is necessary to occupy this discipline with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on exercising comprehensive dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the field of natural science.
In the field of literature and art, there is also this absurd criticism. In a "History of Western Music" compiled at that time under the principle of "class struggle and ideological struggle as the theme," it is said: "All the achievements of Greek culture were achieved under the impetus of the class struggle of the people"; the book says that Schubert's music "often played a negative role favorable to feudal restoration in objective terms"; it says that Bizet faithfully served the reactionary political line of the Second Empire, which represents the interests of the bourgeoisie and the big landowners; it says that Verdi's works are tools of public opinion that use bourgeois humanitarianism, humanism, and predestination to conceal and reconcile real class contradictions; it says that Shostakovich, on behalf of the bourgeois forces, has repeatedly competed against the proletariat to promote the restoration of capitalism and implement revisionist political lines, creating public opinion.
Through the criticism of the domestic policies of some socialist countries during the "Cultural Revolution," we can also clearly see from the opposite perspective the "socialist" characteristics pursued by the "Cultural Revolution." For example, in the article "Advancing along the Road Opened up by the October Socialist Revolution," it is said that the Soviet Union "wore the cloak of 'building communism' but replaced socialist planned economy and distribution according to work with the profit rules and free competition of capitalism, transforming state-owned enterprises and collective farms into enterprises and wealthy peasant economy of a capitalist nature."
In the article "Iron Evidence of the Comprehensive Restoration of Capitalism in the Countryside by Soviet Revisionists", it is argued that the Soviet authorities: first, implemented a "new system" with profits as the core. The so-called "comprehensive economic accounting system" is centered around prioritizing profits above all else. They actively implemented the system of distributing land to teams and the system of rewarding production in rural areas; promoted the further development of "internal economic accounting" in collective farms, stipulating that all products, including agricultural and sideline products, are commodities, and established the relationship between production teams and livestock farms completely on the basis of capitalist commodity money relations. This series of measures completely dismantled the socialist production relations in the Soviet agricultural sector, turning rural farms into capitalist agricultural enterprises. Second, they strongly supported private economy and encouraged members to engage in sideline occupations. After Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others came to power, the development of private economy was further intensified. Their first measure in agriculture was to relax the restrictions on private plots and privately-owned livestock, advocating that the development of private economy is "extremely important". With the encouragement and instigation from the Soviet revisionist group, the area of private plots rapidly expanded. The development of privately-owned livestock was also extremely rapid. Third, they encouraged free buying and selling of agricultural products and allowed free markets to proliferate everywhere. Currently, the supply of non-staple food for urban residents in the Soviet Union increasingly relies on the free market.
In the article "Look, How Did Soviet Revisionists Ruin Lenin's Party?", it is argued that the Soviet revisionist group has long been pushing the line of experts, promoting a large number of capitalist intellectuals to control the leadership at all levels of the party, leading the party from being the representative of the interests of the proletariat to becoming a tool serving the privileged class of the bourgeoisie. The Soviet revisionist group, under the banner of "economy over politics" and making economic problems and production issues the center of party activities, promotes and extensively employs "economic experts", while recklessly excluding and replacing the vast majority of workers and peasants cadres. The Soviet revisionist publication "Communist" openly declared that party leaders must be "experts". The proportion of bourgeois intellectuals in the new party members is constantly increasing. In 1966, 40.6% of the new members of the CPSU were office workers, three-quarters of whom were engineers, technicians, and experts in various industries of the national economy.
In the article "The Disastrous Consequences of the Soviet Revisionist Group's Implementation of the 'New Economic Policy'", it is argued that the central element of the Soviet revisionist group's so-called "new system" is to encourage enterprises to pursue profit through various measures and promote production through material incentives. It expanded the autonomy of enterprise management, vigorously implemented a system of regulating production based on market conditions, and expanded the powers of enterprise leaders in hiring, firing, and rewarding and punishing workers. This series of measures has transformed state-owned socialist enterprises into capitalist ones, replacing socialist planned economy with capitalist free competition.
In the article "The Soviet Revisionist Group Opens Wide the Door to the West for 'Tourists' and Promotes the Restoration of Capitalism through the 'International Travel Industry'", it is argued that the Soviet revisionist group is increasingly shamelessly using the "international travel industry" to recruit various types of "tourists" from the capitalist world. They allow these people to spread the debauched and shameless Western way of life, poisoning the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist group uses slogans such as "peaceful coexistence" and "cultural exchange" to surrender to imperialism internationally and serve the restoration of capitalism domestically through the "international travel industry". Due to Khrushchev's revisionist efforts, Western capitalist "tourists" flocked to the Soviet Union. After the new leadership came to power, they not only inherited Khrushchev's methods but went even further. In the past few years, the number of Western "tourists" visiting the Soviet Union has increased exponentially. In order to recruit Western "tourists" and have them spread the capitalist way of life, the Soviet revisionist group spared no effort in sending a large number of advertisements and promotional materials abroad, conducting press conferences overseas, and promoting through advertisements at many international exhibitions. At the same time, the Soviet revisionist group also simplified entry procedures and established contractual relationships with hundreds of travel agencies in capitalist countries to open the door wide for Western "tourists".
In the article "The Soviet Revisionist Group's Implementation of the 'Five-Day Work Week' is a New Scheme to Exploit Workers", it is stated that the so-called "five-day work week" that the Soviet revisionist group has been vigorously promoting for over a year is completely a political conspiracy to distract the dissatisfaction of the Soviet people and a new scheme to intensify the exploitation of workers by the privileged class of the Soviet bourgeoisie. The "five-day work week" that the Soviet revisionist group has been promoting vigorously in the Soviet Union was proposed at the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1966. Over the past two years, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others have used their propaganda machinery and personally made efforts to aggressively market this deceptive scheme. They hyped up this so-called "five-day work week" and claimed that it would "improve the material well-being of the Soviet people" and "create better working and resting conditions for the laboring people of the Soviet Union". They even nonsensically declared it as "one of the major social achievements in the 50-year history of the Soviet Union". In reality, the so-called "five-day work week" is intended to make workers complete the work they used to do in six days within five days for the benefit of the privileged group in the Soviet revisionist regime. The "five-day work week" not only fails to "create better working and resting conditions for the laboring people of the Soviet Union", but on the contrary, it further strengthens their exploitation.
In the article "Various Forms of the Soviet Revisionist Group Implementing the Revisionist Educational Line," it is stated that the Soviet revisionist traitor group, in order to consolidate its reactionary rule and cultivate successors in the form of revisionism, vigorously promoted bourgeois elements in the field of education and implemented a complete set of revisionist lines. The Soviet revisionist group vigorously promoted the "expert governance of schools" policy of the bourgeoisie, making schools a world ruled by the bourgeois academic cliques. The bourgeois worldview of this group completely coincides with the policy of the Soviet revisionist group in the restoration of capitalism, and they are faithful tools in implementing the revisionist educational line. In schools, the bourgeois "experts" act without restrictions and monopolize everything. According to Soviet newspapers and magazines, "of the 39 members of the party committee at Moscow University, 30 were professors and associate professors. The situation is the same in the party organizations of various departments." And the positions of university presidents, deans, and others in power can only be filled by non-professors, doctors, and similar figures. In order to cultivate successors in revisionism, the Soviet revisionist group vigorously promoted the policy of "intellectual education first" serving reactionary politics in schools. One of the Soviet leaders, Mazurov, advocated at a conference of higher education staff in the Soviet Union that the task of Soviet students was to "be familiar with professional knowledge." Yeliujin, the Minister of Higher and Secondary Vocational Education in the Soviet Union, also said that the basic requirement put forward to young people when entering university was to have profound and solid knowledge. This means that the only criterion for admitting new students is their scores. In order to meet the needs of the restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionist group injected a large amount of revisionist toxins into teaching students. The textbooks they compiled, such as "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," "Principles of Marxism," and "Principles of Marxist Philosophy," as well as the newly developed courses such as "Sociology" and "Principles of Communism," are all revisionist black goods that are against Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought. These textbooks promote the idea that communism is "humanitarian," strongly oppose Stalin and proletarian dictatorship, and peddle the fallacy of "all-people's party" and "all-people's state," creating "theories" for the restoration of capitalism. The "specialized" courses set up by the Soviet revisionist group in schools also serve the restoration of capitalism. For example, in 1965, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed the "new management system" vigorously promoting the restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionists immediately decided to establish dozens of new economics departments in various universities in the Soviet Union, and opened higher economic schools in several large cities, training a large number of "economists" who can implement this policy of restoring capitalism. The reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie also responded one after another, compiling new economic textbooks and reference books that advocated the restoration of capitalism. The Soviet revisionist group took many measures to encourage students to pursue fame and wealth by vigorously promoting "material incentives." They used the bourgeois "academic titles" system to "stimulate" researchers. If they wrote a so-called "academic paper" appreciated by the Soviet revisionist group, they could receive various "academic titles." Once they obtained an "academic title," their salary would immediately increase significantly, achieving both fame and fortune. In order to cultivate successors in revisionism, the Soviet revisionist group also established a so-called "experimental secondary school" to train "geniuses," conducting the "Siberian Olympics" consisting of three rounds of exams in Siberia to select so-called "genius" students, and so on. 
What is worth noting is not the absurdity and ridiculousness displayed in such criticism, but the understanding and pursuit of a socialist society that it reflects. It is precisely because of this kind of socialist view that the "Cultural Revolution" is made possible.
In fact, the criticism of "old ideas," "revisionism," "capitalism," and the like during the "Cultural Revolution" is difficult to say is in line with reality, and the methods used completely violate the principles of Marxism. In a society that denies or belittles material interests, regards a certain level of development of a commodity economy as a capitalist restoration, and views a market economy as a fierce beast, and in a society that belittles knowledge and intellectuals, treats democracy merely as a means, and often has a limited understanding of law and legal systems that tends to remain in an agricultural society, the answer to what constitutes revisionism and capitalism, and what constitutes socialism, can be imagined. It can be imagined what kind of "destruction" and "establishment" will be based on this foundation.
2. The form of opposing revisionism under the theory of "continuing revolution" - "Cultural Revolution"
In the early 1960s, under the deteriorating international situation, the different judgments on the domestic situation within the Chinese Communist Party and the different understandings of socialist construction prompted Mao Zedong to raise the question of whether China would have revisionism. On this basis, a socialist education movement was launched, believing that "class struggle, once grasped, solves everything." Towards the eve of the "Cultural Revolution," he put forward the concept of "capitalist roaders in power" and believed that they had formed a "capitalist headquarters" within the central leadership with a revisionist political line and organizational line, with agents in various regions and departments. However, the "Four Cleanups" campaign in rural areas, the "Five Anti" campaign in cities, and the criticism in the ideological field could not solve the problem. Only by openly, comprehensively, and from the bottom up mobilizing the masses, could the power usurped by the capitalist-roaders be regained. The best form of conducting this "revolution" is the "Cultural Revolution," and the distinctive characteristic of the "Cultural Revolution" is to achieve "great order" through "great chaos."
In philosophy, Mao Zedong has always advocated for the principle of "breaking in order to build". In the 1960s, due to a severe assessment of "revisionism" and the "restoration of capitalism", he directly applied this philosophical concept to real life. He did not consider that the Communist Party of China had already evolved from a party leading armed struggle and class struggle to a ruling party leading socialist construction. He also did not consider that China was already a socialist country led by the Communist Party and did not believe that a socialist country could be fully improved and developed through peaceful methods, reform, or reformism. Therefore, he still adhered to the ideology and experiences of the revolutionary warfare period. In order to oppose "revisionism" and "capitalist roader", he proposed this highly destructive approach that would disrupt the state power. In a letter to Jiang Qing on July 8, 1966, he pointed out, "The world is in chaos, and we will achieve great order. After seven or eight years, it will happen again." The report of the 10th Party Congress on the revision of the party constitution again identified it as an "objective law". During the turmoil, party organizations at all levels were generally impacted and paralyzed, party cadres at all levels were widely criticized and struggled against, and party members' organized activities were suspended. Mao Zedong initially mistakenly saw this "chaos" as "chaos for the enemy, and the training of the masses", seeing it as a sign of the masses being fully mobilized. Later, he realized that he wanted to transform this "chaos" into "order" to stabilize the situation, and took many measures for this purpose, such as establishing revolutionary committees at all levels as the political power structure and restoring party's organized activities. However, the turmoil could not be stopped, and "achieving great order" remained wishful thinking. In fact, in a state where the people's democratic dictatorship is implemented, all power belongs to the people, and turmoil can only disrupt the people's governance of the country, causing damage and losses in all aspects of work. The reasons for this are not only due to the erroneous guiding ideology and methods of "achieving great chaos", but also due to the vague and incorrect understanding of the concept of "revisionism" and its identification. What exactly is "revisionism"? What are the criteria for it? Does "revisionism" exist? Where is the boundary between revision and reform? These important theoretical questions were not clarified at that time. This is the tragedy of the "Cultural Revolution" that attempted to achieve "great order" through "great chaos" in opposition to revisionism.
3. The development economic model guided by the theory of "continuing revolution" - "emphasizing revolution, promoting production."
After 1957, there was a continuous development of the belief that revolution in the superstructure and ideological fields could promote economic development. The "Great Leap Forward" in 1958 confirmed the belief that after achieving victory over the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, there would inevitably be a peak in production and construction. This understanding developed into "class struggle, catch it all" in 1963 during the "Cultural Revolution". After the extreme "revolutionary" overthrow of the "bourgeois headquarters", it was believed that decisive victory had been achieved in the superstructure, eliminating various "revisionist" and "capitalist" thoughts, removing various regulations and systems that controlled and suppressed workers and farmers, and achieving the mental revolution of the people. This was believed to clear away various obstacles to production and inevitably lead to more, faster, better, and more efficient work. In reality, this policy reversed the relationship between revolution and production, reversed the relationship between superstructure and economic base, absolutized the experience of the wartime, exaggerated the counterproductive effects of production relations and ideology, and violated the principle of Marxism that the productive forces ultimately determine the outcome. According to Lenin's view, the transfer of state power from one class to another is the primary and fundamental sign of revolution. However, during the "Cultural Revolution", the "revolution" that was pursued had a specific meaning of political struggle against "revisionism" and the "bourgeoisie", which inevitably created a contradiction between revolution and production. In this "great revolution", most theoretical viewpoints in various fields such as history, science, culture, education, art, and management, which explored the relationship between planning and the market, commodities and money, politics and the economy, superstructure and economic base, were labeled as "poisonous weeds" that opposed the party, socialism, and Marxism, and were subjected to endless criticism. At the same time, some "left" theoretical viewpoints were also developing. Mao Zedong's criticism of the theory of proletarian dictatorship at the end of 1974, his criticism of the eight-grade wage system, labor distribution, and currency exchange were clearly borrowed from some outdated Marxist discourses. Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and others, under the guise of "revolution", exaggerated and propagated various ultraleft fallacies that disrupted production. They slandered the historical materialism principle that the productive forces determine the production relations and ultimately determine the superstructure, which they called the "materialist conception of the productive forces". Many correct principles of socialism, such as developing productive forces, developing a commodity economy, implementing labor distribution, and learning advanced foreign technology, were all criticized as revisionism and capitalism. Thus, under socialist conditions, the main motive for people to engage in productive labor became not material interests but rather spirit, morality, and revolutionary enthusiasm, which was an endless class struggle, deviating from the basic principles of Marxism. As a result, there was a long-lasting severe structural and regional imbalance in the national economy, people's enthusiasm for production declined, economic efficiency greatly decreased, and the national economy was on the brink of collapse. The original hope of achieving "mental revolutionization" and "the transformation of the spiritual into the material" through the revolutionary process did not produce brilliant spiritual flowers or bountiful material achievements. This is another important tragedy of this "revolution".
4. The Party-building model under the theory of "continuing the revolution" - the "Fifty-Character" Party-building program.
According to the theory of "continuing revolution," a large number of representatives of the bourgeoisie, counter-revolutionary revisionists, have infiltrated the party, government, and military. They have formed a headquarters of the bourgeoisie within the party central committee and have agents in various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and central departments. They have taken control of the party. Based on this mistaken evaluation, the "Cultural Revolution" began and party committees at all levels became the targets of the power struggle. Under the slogan of "kicking out the party committee and causing revolution," the criticism of the "bourgeois reactionary line" spread widely from central departments, provincial and city party committees, to grassroots party branches (except for the People's Liberation Army system), causing widespread impact and power seizures. The organization activities of party members were also suspended.
After October 1967, Mao Zedong proposed the task of rectifying the party. At the First Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee, he emphasized that the party "needed to be rebuilt" and therefore, "every branch must be reorganized among the masses." His statement that the "party organization should consist of advanced proletarian elements and be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemies and be a vigorous vanguard organization" became the "fifty-character guideline" for rectifying and building the party. This "guideline" made "fighting against class enemies" the party's primary task, while neglecting the leadership of national economic, political, and cultural construction. At that time, the "class enemies" mainly referred to the so-called "bourgeois headquarters" represented by Liu Shaoqi and their agents in various regions. By 1971, on the basis of the restoration of grassroots organizations, each province, city, and autonomous region successively held party congresses and established new provincial party committees.
One of the main contents of this rectification campaign was to "discard the old and recruit the new," emphasizing the entrance of "energetic and spirited proletarian advanced elements who were courageous in the class struggle and willing to fight on the front lines" into the party. Under this ideological guidance, a part of the genuinely qualified party members could not resume their organizational activities or were mistakenly expelled from the party, while a considerable number of new party members who did not meet the requirements were admitted. This party-wide rectification movement completely ignored the objective situation of class struggle and the primary contradictions within our country, instead excessively emphasizing the extreme seriousness of the struggle between the two classes and the two paths and the realistic danger of the restoration of revisionism. It demanded that every party member armed their minds with the "leftist" erroneous theory of "continuing revolution under proletarian dictatorship" and raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and continuing revolution. As a result, the detrimental ideological trends that seriously developed during the "Cultural Revolution," such as personality cult and anarchism, continued to erode and harm the party, and it was impossible to solve them fundamentally. The relationships between party members and between party members and party organizations were mostly in an abnormal state. In this way, with the development of the "leftist" errors in socialist class struggle, not only did the party fail to complete the transition from a revolutionary party to a ruling party, but it ended up creating its own opposition during the "Cultural Revolution."
5. The theory of "continuing revolution" as a path to achieving the ideal society - "struggle, criticism, reform."
The original meaning of "斗、批、改" is to "struggle against the capitalist roaders, criticize the reactionary academic authorities of the bourgeoisie, criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, reform education, reform literature and art, and reform all superstructures that are incompatible with the socialist economic base, in order to consolidate and develop the socialist system." In September 1968, when the revolutionary committees at all provincial levels were established, the People's Daily published an editorial announcing that the "Cultural Revolution" had entered the "斗、批、改" stage.
After the establishment of New China, in the process of exploring the socialist path in China, based on the development and changes in understanding of what socialism is, how to build socialism, and the national conditions of China at different periods, Mao Zedong formed certain viewpoints, abandoning some thoughts, and persisting in and developing certain theories. During the "斗、批、改" stage, he based his actions on these basic understandings and theories related to socialism that had undergone changes but were still held or developed.
Throughout his long revolutionary career, Mao Zedong always ardently envisioned realizing a socialist society that is just, equal, pure, and prosperous. In this society, there would be no obvious differences or division of labor, and people could engage in both mental and physical labor. Everyone would have lofty ideals and noble morals, and they could consciously transform and elevate themselves through practice. In this society, the relations of production, superstructure, and ideology would have a powerful counteracting effect. Continuous revolution in these fields would strongly drive rapid economic development, enabling the entire society to obtain abundant motivation for production and scientific development through uninterrupted class struggle, thereby allowing the people to live a prosperous and happy life. The fundamental characteristic of this society is public ownership because "public ownership is the source of strength and prosperity" and "this source will remain strong after achieving a single socialist state ownership." In this society, the party leads everything, and in order to ensure that the party does not degenerate, various forms of rectification and reform of the party must be conducted, including the "Cultural Revolution." The governing bodies of this society must implement principles of simplification and efficiency, and they should embody several principles of the Paris Commune, such as management personnel being elected and replaceable by the masses at any time, narrowing the wage gap with ordinary laborers, and regularly participating in physical labor. The governing bodies and their staff must accept supervision from the masses, vehemently oppose bureaucratism, maintain close ties with the masses, and the "Cultural Revolution" is "partly aimed at transforming our state machinery." Although this society still has to retain commodity production and the exchange of currency, caution and restrictions must be placed on them since they are products of the old society and can serve as the soil for the emergence of the bourgeoisie and capitalism even under socialist conditions, constantly generating new bourgeoisie. Although there still exist differences in distribution in this society, these differences cannot expand but must continuously shrink so as to maintain the purity of people's spirits and equality among people. This society must allow the broad masses of the people to live a prosperous life, but as the ruling party, it must maintain high vigilance toward this prosperity because a prosperous life will gradually erode people's revolutionary will and even lead to moral decline. Poverty and hardship, however, can cultivate a fertile ground for pure morals and noble ideals, and so on. These ideas and pursuits are to varying degrees reflected in the various activities of "斗、批、改".
The "struggle, criticism, and reform" movement reflects Mao Zedong's efforts to establish a new type of socialism. In the movement, there was a strong pursuit of social equality and fairness, a pursuit of "revolution erupting from the depths of the soul" for moral purification, and a pursuit of the purity of ownership and the purity of the class ranks. This was both a rejection of the shortcomings of the traditional Soviet socialist model and a response to the unavoidable shortcomings in the process of modernization at that time. According to Mao Zedong's vision, the "struggle, criticism, and reform" movement was intended to end the "Cultural Revolution" on the basis of affirming its victories and consolidating the established pattern, and to restore the normal order of the country. However, because the various tasks of the "struggle, criticism, and reform" movement actually materialized and systematized the "Leftist" errors in various fields, resulting in a great deal of idealism and serious destructiveness, it not only harmed a large number of cadre and masses but also continued to create chaos in many aspects.
In summary, the theory of "continuing the revolution" is a general summary of Mao Zedong's later "Leftist" erroneous views on the issue of socialist class struggle. These views neither conform to Marxism-Leninism nor to the reality of China, but are a combination of distorted Marxism and distorted Chinese reality, thus causing great setbacks and mistakes in the process of the sinicization of Marxism. Launching the "Cultural Revolution" in accordance with the theory of "continuing the revolution" is neither a revolution nor progress in any meaningful sense. It did not disturb the enemy, only caused chaos for themselves, and therefore never achieved "great order out of great chaos". History has already determined that the "Cultural Revolution" was an internal turmoil initiated by leaders' mistakes and exploited by counter-revolutionary groups, which brought serious disasters to the Party, the country, and the people of all ethnic groups. The long-term turmoil inflicted the most serious setbacks and losses to the Party, the country, and the people since the establishment of New China, with the national income loss amounting to about 500 billion yuan and the people's living standards declining. The Party organization and the state power were greatly weakened, and a large number of cadres and masses suffered brutal persecution, with democracy and the rule of law trampled upon at will. The cause of science, culture, and education suffered severe damage, and the gap in scientific and technological level with advanced countries in the world became more obvious. The fine traditions and moral standards of the Party and the people were to a considerable extent abandoned. Metaphysics ran rampant, idealism prevailed. Most notably, it greatly damaged the reputation of Marxism, weakened people's belief in Marxism, and caused extreme ideological confusion. The whole country was plunged into a serious political and social crisis.
Ⅳ. Resistance and Struggle: Unrelenting Exploration of the Sinicization of Marxism in the "Cultural Revolution"
During the period of the "Cultural Revolution", the party made serious mistakes in its overall guiding ideology and encountered setbacks in the process of promoting the modernization of Marxism. However, there were also a large number of party members, cadres, and masses who persisted in the truth of Marxism, and made difficult resistance and struggle against the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution", continuing the unremitting exploration of the sinicization of Marxism. As a result, there were two peaks of criticizing the ultra-left trend, implementing party policies, and carrying out various rectifications during the turmoil. These were the criticism of the ultra-left trend led by Zhou Enlai around 1972 and the comprehensive rectification led by Deng Xiaoping in 1975. The two rectifications made efforts to restore the true face of Marxism, to a certain extent, correct the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution" based on China's actual conditions, and made certain adjustments and reforms to the rigid system. Some understandings of socialism that are more in line with China's national conditions have developed. Even Mao Zedong himself, when he made serious mistakes, repeatedly called on the whole party to seriously study the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and he always believed that his theory and practice were Marxist and necessary for consolidating proletarian dictatorship. These explorations and efforts prepared for finding the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the second historic leap of sinicizing Marxism after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. 
1. In the early stage of the turmoil, the top leadership of the Party resisted and fought against the turmoil. 
After the launch of the "Cultural Revolution", Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other top leaders advocated strengthening the party's leadership, maintaining production order, and preventing the chaotic situation from expanding. They felt "very incomprehensible, very unserious, and not very effective" about the vigorous mass movements. Regarding Mao Zedong's high praise for the big-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and others during the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, Liu Shaoqi said, "I really can't see why it is more significant than the Paris Commune Manifesto." In a speech in December, Zhou Enlai said, "The speed, breadth, and depth of the Cultural Revolution are all beyond what we originally anticipated. All of us, including myself, were not mentally prepared enough for this." They felt that there was a big gap between this and their understanding of Marxism. 
At the end of 1966, regarding how to carry out the "Cultural Revolution" in industrial and mining enterprises, some old comrades in the party, represented by Zhou Enlai, made great efforts to maintain production order and the basic principles of Marxism, and engaged in fierce confrontations with the Central Cultural Revolution Group. At the National Industrial and Transportation Symposium held from November to December 1966, comrades in attendance advocated that the movement in industrial and transportation enterprises should be unifiedly led by the party committee, and the relationship between revolution and production should be correctly handled. It was insisted that production should not be disrupted for the sake of revolution. The conference rejected the draft regulations proposed by the Central Cultural Revolution Group that called for the comprehensive implementation of the "Cultural Revolution" in industrial and transportation enterprises. However, the conference was criticized and suppressed by Lin Biao and Jiang Qing.
The comprehensive seizure of power and armed conflict triggered by the "Cultural Revolution" deeply concerned veteran revolutionaries such as Chen Yi, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. In early 1967, they had intense clashes with the Central Cultural Revolution Group. At meetings held at Jingxi Hotel and Huairentang, they fiercely criticized the egregious actions of Lin Biao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, who had caused chaos among the party and the military since the "Cultural Revolution" began. They denounced their disruptive practices in factories, villages, and the military. They believed that the military was the cornerstone of the dictatorship of the proletariat; if the military were to descend into turmoil, it would be unable to fulfill its duty to defend the country and resist external invasion. They questioned the renaming of Shanghai as the "Shanghai Commune" without any discussion by the Political Bureau. They asked: What was the purpose of such a major change to the national system without party leadership? Can a revolution exist without party leadership? Without party leadership, the masses liberating themselves and educating themselves is merely metaphysics! However, this righteous struggle was suppressed and condemned as the "February Counterflow".
These forms of resistance and struggle arose from a lack of understanding of the "Cultural Revolution" and strong dissatisfaction with some extreme practices. Although they did not reach a certain theoretical height, they did prompt people to think and reflect on the theory and origins of the "Cultural Revolution", initiating independent thinking within strict repression.
2. The Criticism of the Ultra-Leftist Trend led by Zhou Enlai in 1972
The occurrence of the Lin Biao incident was the result of the "Cultural Revolution" violating the basic principles of Marxism. Objectively, it declared the bankruptcy of the "Cultural Revolution". The broad masses of cadres and the people gradually became skeptical of the theory of the "Cultural Revolution", and Mao Zedong also deepened his dissatisfaction with the ultra-leftist trend. Taking advantage of this opportune moment, Zhou Enlai led the criticism of the ultra-leftist trend, adjusted various work, accelerated the implementation of cadre policies and intellectual policies, and made efforts to restore the true face of Marxism. A group of overthrown party, government, and military leaders returned to their leadership positions, and the economy, science and education, and other fields began to recover and develop. During the adjustment, Zhou Enlai sharply pointed out: the ultra-leftist trend is "hollow, extreme, formalistic, and empty rhetoric with the proletariat as the political banner". In response to the destruction of economic work by the anarchist trend, Zhou Enlai and the State Council he led proposed measures to rectify enterprises and vigorously restore various regulations and systems that had been damaged. Through measures such as significantly reducing the scale of infrastructure construction and streamlining the number of employees, they resolved problems such as excessive number of workers, total wages, and grain sales that greatly exceeded the targets, reversing the downward trend of the national economy. In rural areas, the Party Central Committee issued instructions regarding the distribution issue in rural people's communes, reaffirming the need to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work and not to negate various types of operations and family sideline businesses allowed by policies as capitalist things. In scientific and educational work, Zhou Enlai demanded a focus on basic science and theoretical research. He also ensured the implementation of the party's cultural, ethnic, and united front policies. During the rectification, Zhou Enlai repeatedly emphasized the need to promote diligent study of professional skills for the revolution, improve quality, bravely tackle key problems, and uphold the principle of proletarian politics taking the lead "in the professional field".
The criticism of the ultra-left trend by Zhou Enlai's leadership was a continuation of the correct proposition raised by many central leaders in early 1967 to rectify the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution". After nearly two years of adjustment and consolidation, various aspects of work have shown significant improvement. However, Mao Zedong believed that the criticism of the ultra-left trend was linked to negating the "Cultural Revolution". He believed that the current task was still to oppose the ultra-right rather than criticize the ultra-left. In May 1973, during the Central Committee Work Conference, Mao Zedong conveyed instructions regarding "focusing only on production, neglecting superstructure and the line, not criticizing". Consequently, the efforts led by Zhou Enlai to rectify the "left" were forced to be interrupted.
In 1975, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, comprehensive rectification took place. 
The prolonged and repeated "Cultural Revolution" had intensified people's weariness, leading to increasing doubts about the theory and essence of the "Cultural Revolution". People generally hoped for economic development, social stability, and improved living conditions. Against this backdrop, Deng Xiaoping, who was entrusted with the task in a time of crisis, carried out drastic reforms in various aspects, attempting to reverse the erroneous direction of the sinicization of Marxism and restore the true face of Marxism.
In January 1975, the Fourth National People's Congress reaffirmed the grand goals of the Four Modernizations, hoping to redirect the attention of the national people to the development of the economy and the revitalization of the country. The leadership of the State Council, with Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping at its core, was established to lay the organizational and ideological foundation for comprehensive rectification. Subsequently, Deng Xiaoping presided over the daily work of the State Council and the Party Central Committee, and began a thorough rectification. During the comprehensive rectification, Deng Xiaoping led the drafting of documents such as "Several Issues on Accelerating Industrial Development," "Outline of Work Report of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," and "General Outline on Party and National Work" (draft), and convened a series of professional conferences, putting forward a series of ideas with far-reaching guiding significance. He emphasized repeatedly that the Four Modernizations are the overall situation; a strong leadership team must be established, factional struggle must be resolutely fought, and necessary rules and regulations must be established; stability and unity must be achieved, and socialist economic development must be promoted; the core of the rectification is the rectification of the Party, with a focus on rectifying leadership teams at all levels and implementing cadre policies; among the Four Modernizations, agricultural modernization requires more effort; science and technology are also productive forces, and scientific and technological personnel are laborers; research must lead development and promote production... In this rectification, Deng Xiaoping also specifically raised the issue of "how to propagate Mao Zedong Thought" and mentioned the lessons of Lin Biao's separation from Mao Zedong Thought, which was clearly aimed at the "Gang of Four". Deng Xiaoping's overall rectification, his ideological views, inherited and developed important ideas of Zhou Enlai's readjustment in 1972, and constituted another major struggle between the Party's correct leadership and ultraleftist trends during the "Cultural Revolution". The comprehensive rectification aimed to clarify the ideological theories and policies that were reversed during the "Cultural Revolution" on some important issues, and thus began a limited rectification. The results of the comprehensive rectification once again proved the correctness of adhering to the path of Marxism with Chinese characteristics. However, the thoroughness of the rectification would inevitably develop into a relatively systematic correction of the "Cultural Revolution". It was met with the frenzied opposition of the "Gang of Four" and was also intolerable to Mao Zedong. Therefore, just like the criticism of the ultraleftist trends led by Zhou Enlai, the comprehensive rectification had to be interrupted under pressure. This reflects, from one side, the difficulties of adhering to the path of Marxism with Chinese characteristics under the guidance of "Left" leaning thoughts. However, the comprehensive rectification gradually enabled the broad masses of cadres and the masses to see who was following the direction of historical development and the aspirations of the people, what the true face of Marxism is, and what the ultimate goal of socialist development is, thereby laying solid ideological and mass foundations for ending the decade-long chaos and preparing and brewing for the second historic leap of implementing the thought of reform and opening up and realizing Marxism with Chinese characteristics in the new period. Deng Xiaoping later said, "Reform was actually tested from 1974 to 1975", "At that time, reform was referred to as rectification, emphasizing the promotion of the economy, and first and foremost, the restoration of production order."
4. A new judgment on the international situation and opening up new diplomatic opportunities
In the 1970s, the international situation underwent tremendous changes. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai accurately assessed the situation and made major decisions for foreign affairs with foresight and courage, improving China's external environment and creating favorable conditions for China's external affairs. Among them, a key aspect was the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and the easing of Chinese-US relations.
As China's international standing improved, with joint efforts from many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, on October 25, 1971, the 26th UN General Assembly passed a resolution to restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. Subsequently, in February 1972, US President Richard Nixon visited China, and after talks, the "Sino-US Joint Communiqué" was signed on February 28, marking the beginning of the normalization process of China-US relations. The easing of Sino-US relations directly promoted the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and the climax of establishing diplomatic relations with many Western European countries.
In the strategic context of opening up a new era in diplomacy, China has also developed new economic relations with foreign countries. Zhou Enlai and others, under the pressure of the Jiang Qing Group's so-called "pro-foreignism", made efforts to carry out foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges. They imported a batch of technologically advanced complete sets of equipment and individual machines from abroad. Chen Yun, who assisted Zhou Enlai in foreign trade work, proposed bold research and utilization of capitalism, emphasizing that "dealing with capitalism is an established trend" and "if we do not study capitalism, we will suffer losses". He guided the use of funds, technology, and equipment from capitalist countries, as well as the management methods of commodity exchanges and futures markets, which played a significant role in the recovery of economic construction and deepened the Party's understanding of capitalism and its relationship with socialism, as well as the development characteristics and trends of the contemporary world.
In the 1970s, China further developed friendly cooperative relations with third world countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In this process, Mao Zedong gradually formed his thinking on the division of the "Three Worlds". This is a strategic part of his thinking in his later years. This division highlighted the contradiction between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, which were implementing hegemonism, and the anti-hegemonic forces of the world, emphasizing the important role of third world countries. It also emphasized the importance of uniting second world countries and utilizing the contradictions between the two superpowers. It emphasized that China belongs to the third world and should unite all forces that can be united to form the broadest international anti-hegemonic united front and fight for world peace. Although these analyses also had aspects that were not in line with reality in theory, they played a positive role in guiding China's foreign work at the time, persisting in opposing the hegemonism and war threat of the superpowers, and making efforts to establish and develop friendly cooperative relations with third world countries and other types of countries, including normalizing relations between China and the United States.
In the fifth part, the vast majority of party members, cadres, and masses resist and struggle against various forms of the Cultural Revolution.
During the Cultural Revolution, in response to the difficult efforts of leaders such as Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping at the top level, many veteran party members, ordinary party members, as well as intellectuals and workers and peasants, also deeply reflected on everything that happened during the Cultural Revolution. They resisted the ultra-leftism of the Cultural Revolution in various forms, persisted in the efforts to localize Marxism, and accumulated the wisdom and strength for the further leap of localizing Marxism in China. Some of them criticized the ultra-leftist errors straightforwardly, some calmly pondered and wrote theoretical articles summarizing the party's historical experience, some proposed suggestions and opinions to the party on important issues in practical work, and some earnestly preached the party's fine traditions to the masses they could reach. These activities were actually a resistance and struggle against the behaviors that damaged the localization of Marxism in the Cultural Revolution in different ways. For example, after the "September 13th" incident, Zhang Wentian wrote a large number of articles, systematically discussing issues such as the nature, stage, tasks of socialism and the basic laws of building socialism in China, emphasizing that "ultimately, all work in socialist society is aimed at significantly improving productivity and developing socialist economy". He sharply criticized the "leftist" views of "those who talk about politics but are afraid to talk about the economy or material interests", pointing out: "In short, not all politics can 'take the lead', only politics that is the 'concentration of the economy', that truly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the people, can mobilize hundreds of millions of people to take action. This once again shows how wrong it is to oppose politics to the economy, or to make politics surpass the economy or even detach from the economy. Those 'politicians' who talk about politics but are afraid to talk about the economy, please carefully study what really constitutes the content of the Marxist truth that 'politics is the concentration of the economy'!"
"Of course, socialist revolution and the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship are very important. But may I ask, what is the purpose of socialist revolution, and what is the purpose of consolidating proletarian dictatorship? Is it to revolutionize for the sake of revolution, to dictate for the sake of dictatorship? Absolutely not." "If we don't strive to improve socialist productive forces and the lives of the people, and merely indulge in the lofty rhetoric of 'communism,' then communism can only be degraded into a magic trick to fill empty stomachs. This is undoubtedly a great insult to the noble cause of communism!"
"Under the proletarian dictatorship, in the absence of war, the correctness of the Party's political line and its degree of correctness, as well as the consolidation of proletarian power and its degree of consolidation, must ultimately be measured by the achievements and magnitude of socialist economic construction. Politics that do not mobilize the enthusiasm of the people and do not promote and drive economic development, no matter how visually appealing or pleasing to the ear, are ultimately hollow and can even bring disasters to the people and the nation's construction undertakings. Correct political leadership and the achievements of economic construction must have a proportional relationship."
Regarding the struggle against internal trends within the Party, Zhang Wentian pointed out in the article "The Correct Conduct of Internal Struggles within the Party": "The contradictions within the Party are not only contradictions among the people, but also contradictions among revolutionary comrades who struggle for the cause of communism." "Can we simply label comrades with erroneous tendencies towards opportunism within the Party as 'agents of the bourgeoisie'? Although this tendency is beneficial to the bourgeoisie and harmful to the proletariat, it cannot be said that comrades with such tendencies are 'agents of the bourgeoisie.'"
"Regarding the dangers of rightist tendencies and the necessity of combating them, now everyone understands quite clearly. However, it seems that there are still many people who do not fully grasp the dangers of 'leftist' tendencies and the necessity of combating them. Some comrades even believe that 'leftist' tendencies are better than rightist tendencies," "they even go so far as to advocate 'left' without right." "If, disregarding changes in social conditions, we reduce the struggle between the two lines within the Party to a struggle against rightism, only opposing the right without opposing the 'left,' 'left' tendencies are bound to be encouraged and develop, and under certain conditions, they may even become the main danger. After 'left' tendencies become the main danger, it is necessary to continue to concentrate our efforts to oppose rightist tendencies, which may lead us to mistake correct principles as rightist tendencies, greatly harming comrades and causing serious consequences for the Party's cause."
He also proposed, "Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are rigorous, complete, and scientific systems of theories and thoughts. They require comprehensive research, oppose any one-sided understanding, cherry-picking, or selective interpretations." This is consistent with Deng Xiaoping's critique of the "Two Whatevers" discourse.
Some theoretical and intellectual experts of the party are also contemplating the future development issues of China. Renowned economist, Sun Yefang, was imprisoned in Qincheng Prison in April 1968 due to his advocacy for viewpoints on commodity circulation and the law of value. He continued to study economics while in prison and took the opportunity to write over 30,000 words of an outline on socialist economics.
Gu Zhun, the foremost proponent of market economy theory under the conditions of socialism and former researcher at the Economic Research Institute of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, suffered brutal persecution during the "Cultural Revolution". During that period, he deeply contemplated a series of socialist theories.
Regarding the Soviet model, he said, "Their economy did exhibit development, but it was still a development under a wartime economic system. Moreover, it was an extremely clumsy and stagnant development, solely aimed at military preparedness. In other words, the economic system of (Stalinism), which has weighed heavily on them, has become an incurable disease." "Because of this, their economic system is essentially a wasteful and suffocating system. The proportion of the additional income derived from economic development used for military expenditure and the expansion of basic industries is significant, and the amount allocated to increasing the consumption fund can never keep up with wage increases." He further pointed out, "I believe that in the visible future, this seemingly suffocating system will still continue to move forward in a crooked manner," but there will be a force "to overthrow this suffocating system." Twenty years later, the events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union confirmed Gu Zhun's predictions during the decade of turmoil.
Gu Zhun reflected on the revolutionary and construction experiences as well as the "Cultural Revolution" in socialist China after the establishment of the New China, and raised a fundamental question: the question of "what happens after Nora leaves." This question is about how to build socialism after the success of the socialist revolution, or how to achieve the ideal goals after the revolution's victory, which is what we later call the question of "what is socialism and how to build socialism." In fact, this question was not only the issue that Mao Zedong had been desperately searching for after the establishment of New China, but also the life-and-death question faced by socialist countries at that time. What distinguishes Gu Zhun's inquiry is that he not only sharply raises the question, but also provides new approaches to analyze and solve this problem within a broad intellectual historical context.
As Gu Zhun put it, everyone who lived in the same era as him went through "the wars and revolutions of the 1930s and 1940s, a grand ideal beyond the resistance against Japan, and the fanaticism caused by this ideal, a religious fanaticism," and they also experienced the revolutionary romanticism of the 1950s, where "one day is equal to twenty years, and poetry is written everywhere," as well as the decade of catastrophe known as the "Great Revolution." This experience led him to ask: "We have found the way to achieve revolution's victory, but what happens after Nora leaves?" "I praise the revolutionary storm. The question is, 'what happens after Nora leaves?'" How to proceed on the path of socialist construction? This question can only be solved "empirically." He reminds people: "Do not think that all our problems have been solved. We must soberly see where the problems lie, know what we have already solved, what remains unsolved, what has gone too far, seek truth from facts instead of treating objective reality dogmatically, and our country will soon soar economically in the world."
Based on a deep observation of the "Cultural Revolution," Gu Zhun said: "I have mixed and contradictory feelings towards the Spartan system. Egalitarianism, the spirit of struggle, and democratic collectivism – I have personally experienced this kind of life, and deeply understand that it is indispensable for revolutionary movements to overthrow oppressors under difficult circumstances. However, the history of Sparta itself shows that this egalitarianism, martial spirit, and collectivism, long maintained by an oligarchic system and harsh discipline, inevitably result in formalism and hypocrisy, with noble appearance and corrupt content, like being splendid on the outside but tattered inside." The questions raised by Gu Zhun were the problems commonly faced by socialist countries at that time, and his analysis of the problems and some conclusions he drew, like Zhang Wentian, Sun Yefang, etc., all radiate the brilliance of the Sinicization of Marxism. During the ten years of turmoil, it was the arduous pursuit of these intellectual pioneers, the fearless pursuit of these usurpers, that left a vivid mark on the history of the development of Marxist Sinicization in contemporary China, driving the process of Sinicization.
In the ten years of turmoil, the vast majority of young people, students, intellectuals, and workers and peasants also went through a process of transition from fanaticism, blind conformity, confusion to awakening. This awakening eventually led to the mass protest movement that erupted in April 1976, represented by the "Tiananmen Incident." This protest was triggered by the suppression of the mourning activities for Zhou Enlai by the "Gang of Four." The "Gang of Four" attempted to overthrow the older generation of revolutionaries, represented by Deng Xiaoping, who firmly advocated the realization of the "Four Modernizations," through the so-called "criticizing Deng and striking back against the rightist reversal of verdicts" movement. However, the broad masses and cadres, who had been educated by the Party for a long time, had already discerned right from wrong through practical struggles. During the protest movement, people voiced the call to "send those castrated scholars who distort Marxism-Leninism to hell." This protest movement, with the background of mourning Zhou Enlai and the breakthrough of opposing the "Gang of Four's" retrogressive actions, was actually a support for the correct leadership of the Party represented by Deng Xiaoping and the socialist development direction mainly focused on comprehensive rectification. However, the protest was suppressed, but no matter what, this nationwide mass movement laid a solid mass foundation for later smashing the Jiang Qing group and pushing forward the sinification of Marxism.
A large number of veteran party members within the Party, represented by Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, became the guardians and seekers of Marxist truth, and the pioneers of socialist reform and opening up, through various forms of resistance and struggle against the errors of the "Cultural Revolution." At that time, these people were regarded as "heretics" and "exceptions," their thoughts were seen as "revisionism," but precisely in them lay the true essence of Marxism. The vast masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, held their positions, strived hard, and fought against the actions incited by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" to "stop production and stir up revolution." Undoubtedly, all of this prepared and accumulated strength in order to smash the "Gang of Four," end the internal strife caused by the "Cultural Revolution," and break through the confusion of the sinification of Marxism, and guide the ideological line of the Party back onto the correct path of sinification of Marxism.
The "Cultural Revolution" was an extreme left deviation and a serious mistake in the process of sinification of Marxism in China. It, from the negative side, prepared the conditions for breaking free from the bondage of dogmatism and the infatuation with empiricism, thus laying the ideological foundation and ample motivation for the second leap of sinification of Marxism. The ten years of practice of the "Cultural Revolution" proved that the theory of "continuing the revolution" and the path it guided were not feasible. The sinification of Marxism must correct its direction and explore a new path. The "Cultural Revolution" dealt a severe blow to the errors of the "left" and the ultra-left trend, and thus became the cradle for nurturing new thought and opening up new paths.

Chapter 10 The Great Ideological Liberation Movement and the Start of the "Second Leap"
The "Cultural Revolution" was carried out in the name of adhering to and developing Marxism, consolidating the socialist system, but it exposed the shortcomings of the party and the state's political life in the most extreme way, damaged the reputation of Marxism, and deviated from the correct direction of Marxism's localization in China. The end of the "Cultural Revolution" prompted people to deeply reflect on some basic issues regarding the development of Chinese socialism: what is socialism exactly? How do we build socialism? What is Marxism? How do we adhere to and develop Marxism? How should China develop? Where should it go? The majority of cadres and masses were in a state of hesitation and confusion.
At the end of the "Cultural Revolution," there were several paths facing the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. One path was to continue affirming the "Cultural Revolution" or the previous "left" mistakes, with the correction of the "three-part mistakes" as defined by Mao Zedong. At that time, most people mentally rejected this path. Another path was to negate the "Cultural Revolution" and then develop it further by negating Mao Zedong, negating the entire history of the Communist Party of China, opposing the socialist path, and advocating for the capitalist path. The Chinese people neither allowed nor could go down this path. The third path was to deeply summarize the lessons of the "Cultural Revolution" and, on the premise of adhering to the socialist direction, open up a new path for the development of socialism in China.
The serious lessons of the "Cultural Revolution" and the rectification of the chaos caused by it urgently needed theoretical answers and clarifications. Along with the development path and prospects of China, Marxist localization also faced new situations and tasks. On one hand, the end of the "Cultural Revolution" provided an opportunity to achieve a huge historical transformation, making it possible to break free from the ideological imprisonment of dogmatism and return to the correct path of Marxism localization. On the other hand, the transformation in the field of ideology is not a one-time event, especially with the long-term influence of "leftist" thinking and dogmatism within the party, which has formed deeply ingrained habits of thinking such as "the more 'left,' the more revolutionary" and "'left' is a matter of methodology, right is a matter of stance," which cannot be completely reversed in a short period of time. At that time, the majority of cadres and masses strongly demanded the correction of the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution," the thorough reversal of the serious situation caused by the ten years of chaos, and the revitalization of China from the danger and difficulty it faced. However, due to the limitations of the era, this urgent demand and desire encountered serious obstacles, and the work of the Party and the state faced a state of hesitation. At that time, the policy of "Two Whatevers" was proposed, which continued the mistakes of the "leftist" path and prevented the immediate adoption of the correct path of Marxism localization after the end of the "Cultural Revolution."
As mentioned before, the development and innovation of Marxism, as well as the realization of the "second leap" of Marxism's sinification in China, can only be meaningful under a system that allows free discussion and fully promotes socialist democracy. From the establishment of New China to 1978, the inability to achieve this development and leap was not due to a lack of talent or the ability to think theoretically, but rather due to the lack of democracy caused by the accumulation of practice (lessons from both positive and negative experiences), especially the loss of democracy caused by the expansion of class struggle errors after 1957. To correct the direction of Marxism, it is necessary to have a democratic atmosphere within the party and the freedom to discuss issues. Through the launch of a movement for ideological liberation, the deep-rooted dogmatism and rigid thinking can be broken, and ideological liberation and democratic discussions can proceed in the right direction. Party veteran comrades represented by Deng Xiaoping fought resolutely against erroneous thoughts represented by the "two whatevers," triggering a grand movement of ideological liberation primarily focusing on the discussion of standards of truth. This created the most fundamental conditions for correcting the direction of sinification of Marxism and preparing for a new historical turning point and a new leap in Marxism's sinification. This movement of ideological liberation and the rectification of the ideological field were mainly achieved through the following steps: first, exposing and criticizing the "Gang of Four" and their erroneous theories, revealing their true nature of distorting Marxism and imposing ideological confinement, and exposing the various manifestations and harms caused by the ultra-left line; second, opposing the erroneous thoughts of the "two whatevers," criticizing their dogmatic attitude towards Marxism and the harm it caused, and proposing a scientific attitude and requirements for a complete and accurate understanding of Mao Zedong Thought; third, initiating a major discussion on the standards of truth, promoting a movement of ideological liberation throughout the party and the people, restoring the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, and shifting the sinification of Marxism from being doctrine-oriented to practice-oriented; fourth, studying new situations, solving new problems, fermenting the policy of reform and opening up, and shifting the focus of work. The sinification of Marxism in China began to make new progress in the correct direction, achieving new achievements and a good start to the second leap.
After repeated struggles explained above, the sinification of Marxism based on practice finally became an irresistible trend of the times, and a great historical turning point was finally achieved.
I. Advancing in hesitation
1. The continuation of the "two whatevers" - The continuation of the dogmatism of the "Cultural Revolution"
After the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Party Central Committee systematically disclosed the evidence of the crimes committed by the counter-revolutionary group led by Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan, and launched a struggle to expose and criticize the Gang of Four. However, due to the inability to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the influence of "left" errors in guiding ideology, there were limitations in the actual work on this struggle. The purge of the ultra-left ideology and its theoretical system of the Gang of Four had certain limitations. Nevertheless, under the guidance of older generations of revolutionary veterans within the party, the vast majority of cadres and masses still combined the exposure and criticism of the Gang of Four with the rectification of ideological and theoretical principles. They criticized the fallacies of the Gang of Four's fabrication and distortion of Marxism, preliminarily clarified some theoretical and policy issues, improved their ability to analyze major problems using basic Marxist viewpoints, and began to restore the true face of Marxism on some significant issues.
The most urgent problem to be solved in the exposure and criticism of the Gang of Four was to quickly eliminate the serious consequences brought about by the decade-long turmoil, to rapidly restore the national economy on the verge of collapse, and to rectify the many unjust, false, and wrong cases caused by the Cultural Revolution. However, due to limitations in understanding, for a period of time, the fundamental issues of the "Cultural Revolution" were not thoroughly recognized, especially the relationship between the "Cultural Revolution" and Mao Zedong's errors in his later years. In this overall context, although the 11th National Congress of the Party declared that the "Cultural Revolution" had ended and reaffirmed the fundamental task of building our country into a socialist modernized powerful nation within the 20th century, the revised Party Constitution still contained "left" mistakes. The process of rehabilitating the work of older cadres and rectifying historical injustices started, but with slow progress and stumbling steps. Although the national economy began to escape chaos, a new round of impetuous errors occurred, proposing unrealistic high targets and slogans that were fundamentally unattainable. In July 1977, a report from the State Council stated that "a new leap forward situation of the national economy is beginning."
The main reason for this situation was the limitations imposed by the historical conditions at that time. On February 7, 1977, the People's Daily, Hongqi Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily published an editorial titled "Grasp the Key Points by Learning the Documents." This editorial emphasized the need to "govern the country according to key principles" and put forward the policy of "Two Whatevers," namely, "We resolutely uphold everything Chairman Mao made decisions about, and we unwaveringly follow Chairman Mao's instructions." The editorial elevated the "Two Whatevers" to the level of guiding the work of the whole party and the entire nation.
On the surface, the "Two Whatevers" seemed to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought, but in fact, it still maintained the errors of Mao Zedong in his later years and stubbornly clung to dogmatism that had brought serious disasters to the Chinese people. It fundamentally violated the basic principles of Marxist sinicization, such as the necessity of combining theory with practice, developing theory with the development of practice, and subjecting theory to practical testing. For example, as the exposure and criticism of the Gang of Four gradually unfolded and further revelations of the harm caused by the Cultural Revolution emerged, the task of fundamentally purging the ultra-left ideology of the Cultural Revolution quickly emerged. In January 1977, the theoretical field proposed a specific critique of Zhang Chunqiao's "On the Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie" and Yao Wenyuan's "On the Social Basis of the Lin Biao Anti-Party Clique." These two articles were representative works of the ultra-left theory in the later stage of the Cultural Revolution and focused on the basic theories of the Cultural Revolution. The initial cleansing of these two articles touched upon fundamental issues of the ultra-left theory after the founding of the People's Republic of China. However, at that time, the leaders responsible for propaganda work believed that "these two articles were reviewed by the Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, so they cannot be specifically criticized."
For example, the wrong theories that initiated and guided the "Cultural Revolution" were taken as the key content to study and promote Volume 5 of Mao Zedong's Selected Works. On April 15, 1977, Volume 5 of Mao Zedong's Selected Works was published and distributed. The decision issued by the central authorities regarding the study of Volume 5 of Mao Zedong's Selected Works highlighted the establishment of the theory of "continuing the revolution" as Mao Zedong's "greatest contribution to Marxism" during the socialist revolution and construction period. At that time, the leaders of the central authorities published an article titled "Carrying the Continued Revolution under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat to the End," elevating the theory of "continuing the revolution" to the fundamental ideology throughout Volume 5 of Mao Zedong's Selected Works and regarding the overthrow of the "Gang of Four" as "another great victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution."
Another example is the work conference held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March 1977. On one hand, it emphasized that "criticizing Deng and counterattacking the trend of reversing the verdicts on rightist cases were decisions made by the great leader Chairman Mao, and criticizing was necessary." At the same time, it proposed that Deng Xiaoping should be allowed to resume work at an appropriate time. Regarding the Tiananmen Incident, on one hand, it was described as a counterrevolutionary event, but it was also stated that it was understandable for the masses to go to Tiananmen Square during the Qingming Festival to express their mourning for Premier Zhou. These various contradictory views not only reflected the initial unfolding of monumental historical changes but also represented the difficulties of transformation.
The "Two Whatevers," purportedly named "upholding Mao Zedong Thought," actually undermine and sever Mao Zedong Thought, violating the basic requirement of Marxism to constantly develop and advance Marxism's localization and contemporization in China. Even Mao Zedong himself did not regard his ideological viewpoints as unalterable "bibles." In the 1930s, when dogmatism prevailed and the entire Party suffered greatly from it, he clearly put forward the famous dictums of "oppose dogmatism" and "without investigation, one has no right to speak," making great contributions to establishing the line of seeking truth from facts.
Therefore, there is no essential difference between the "Two Whatevers" and Lin Biao's implementation of "every statement is the truth, one statement surpasses ten thousand statements," or the "Gang of Four's" fabrication of "always act according to Chairman Mao's established policies." When history called for a major transformation, many people's hands and feet were still tightly bound by invisible shackles. If we were to adhere to the "Two Whatevers," senior comrades like Deng Xiaoping would not be able to return to work, a large number of wrongful cases would not be rectified, class struggle would continue to be the "guiding principle," the whole country would remain in a stagnant and stagnant situation, and it would be difficult for the Party and the country to break free from the disaster of the "Cultural Revolution." Theoretically speaking, according to the "Two Whatevers," Marxism cannot innovate, Mao Zedong Thought cannot develop, and the modernization of Marxism cannot be achieved.
The proposal and implementation of the "two whatevers" had both subjective and objective reasons at the time. Firstly, it was a highly sensitive political issue that required addressing the errors of the Cultural Revolution while also upholding Mao Zedong's historical status and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party. Resolving these issues required accumulating practical experience over time and necessitated great political wisdom. It was necessary to make cadres and the masses understand that only by truthfully pointing out the mistakes of Mao Zedong's late-stage initiation of the Cultural Revolution and correcting them could we truly inherit the excellent traditions of the Chinese Communist Party with Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, which would take some time. Secondly, the influence of "left" deviationism was deeply rooted, and our party was harmed by it for as long as twenty years, with some of its remnants becoming stubborn habits. It was impossible to demand an immediate transformation. In fact, the dogmatic thinking reflected in the "two whatevers" was a chronic problem that existed widely in the international communist movement after World War II. Dogmatism towards Marxist classic authors, dogmatism towards the Stalinist model, and later dogmatism towards our own national leaders persisted and often took the dominant position despite numerous shocks. This is a very complex issue with ideological reasons as well as deeper roots related to the system and cultural traditions.
2. The proposal of accurately and comprehensively understanding Mao Zedong Thought as a scientific proposition
The proposal of the "two whatevers" and the continuation of the "left" policy in different fields and to different extents sparked discussions both within and outside the party. Many comrades expressed their disagreement with using the attitude of the "two whatevers" towards Mao Zedong Thought and gradually started pondering the question: what kind of attitude should be taken towards Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's instructions? After the publication of the editorial "Study Well and Grasp the Main Points" ("学好文件抓住纲"), Geng Tai, the person in charge of the Central Propaganda Department, pointed out, "By publishing this article, it is equivalent to not having completely discredited the Gang of Four. If we follow the attitude of the 'two whatevers' in handling things, nothing can be accomplished." On April 10th, 1977, Deng Xiaoping wrote to Hua Guofeng and Ye Jianying and forwarded it to the Party Central Committee, proposing, "We must use accurate and complete Mao Zedong Thought to guide our entire party, army, and the people of the whole country for generation after generation." The target of his criticism was the rigid attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought reflected in the "two whatevers". On May 24th, Deng Xiaoping once again criticized the "two whatevers." He pointed out, "According to the 'two whatevers', it doesn't make sense to talk about my rehabilitation, nor does it make sense to affirm the activities of the masses in Tiananmen Square in 1976 as 'reasonable'. 'Comrade Mao Zedong said he himself made mistakes. Every sentence one says is correct, every word is correct, that's not possible." "Mao Zedong Thought is a ideological system", "We must hold high the banner, which means we must learn and apply this ideological system."
To truly and comprehensively understand Mao Zedong Thought means using specific, historical, and interconnected perspectives to understand every principle of Mao Zedong Thought, to understand it from the perspective of its entire system and not to separate or dissect Mao Zedong Thought and only understand it from individual phrases or sentences. To accurately understand means to distinguish between basic principles and specific conclusions, to distinguish correct ideas from certain mistakes. In other words, it means distinguishing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology from Mao Zedong's late-stage errors, not denying the scientific system and guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought because of his late-stage errors and not avoiding or disregarding the errors and their impact because we need to uphold Mao Zedong Thought. The proposal of "accurate and complete Mao Zedong Thought" reflects Deng Xiaoping's political courage, political wisdom, and theoretical courage, as well as the urgent requirement of the times, encouraging many cadres and theoretical workers to begin more direct and in-depth criticism of certain important "left" views. The "two whatevers" became increasingly difficult to sustain.
In July 1977, the Third Plenum of the Tenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. This meeting did not mention the "two whatevers" anymore, but it still adhered to the theory of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat". This meeting restored Deng Xiaoping's leadership positions in the party, government, and military that were revoked before. In his speeches after returning to power, Deng Xiaoping emphasized the issue of how to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought. He once again emphasized the need to have a complete and accurate understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, to be good at learning, mastering, and applying the ideological system of Mao Zedong Thought to guide various work, and pointed out that "only in this way can we avoid the separation and distortion of Mao Zedong Thought and the damage to Mao Zedong Thought". He further pointed out that the style advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the mass line, and seeking truth from facts are the most fundamental things, "for our party's current situation, I personally think that the mass line and seeking truth from facts are particularly important". Seeking truth from facts is our party's fine tradition and style, and it is the basic principle of the sinicization of Marxism. However, during the "Cultural Revolution", it was unprecedentedly distorted and weakened, resulting in extreme proliferation of "falsity, exaggeration, and empty talk" and dogmatism throughout the country. Deng Xiaoping's advocacy of seeking truth from facts directly points to the "two whatevers", and has strong pertinence. It further reveals the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, resists and weakens the influence of the "two whatevers", and creates favorable conditions for the proposal of practical criteria and the return of sinicized Marxism to a practical basis.
The 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing in August 1977. The congress proposed that the fundamental task of the party in the new period is to strive to build our country into a great socialist modernized country in the 20th century with the overthrow of the "Gang of Four" as a symbol, and the "Cultural Revolution" was declared over. However, the congress still fully affirmed the "Cultural Revolution" and believed that "this kind of politically-oriented revolution will still occur many times in the future." It also regarded "taking class struggle as the key link" and the theory of "continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" as the most important achievements of contemporary Marxism. The 11th Congress failed to undertake the historical task of correcting the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution" and formulating correct guidelines and policies to achieve historical turning points. This once again indicates that it is a very arduous historical task to completely free ourselves from traditional concepts and dogmatism, correct deep-rooted "left" errors, and set the correct course for sinicized Marxism. The 11th Congress has both progress and stagnation, reflecting a general law in historical development: on the one hand, the tide of history is irresistible, on the other hand, historical progress is not always smooth sailing.
Before and after the convening of the 11th Congress, the First Session of the Fifth National People's Congress was held, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce also gradually resumed their activities. This is of great significance for improving socialist democracy and the legal system, strengthening the cooperation between the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties, and strengthening the united front of the people's democracy, and it has prepared a large number of cadres and resources for ideological liberation and righting the wrongs. These measures themselves have clearly and unequivocally told people that the "Cultural Revolution" must be negated.
Meanwhile, the field of culture and education, which was heavily affected by the "Cultural Revolution", took the lead in rectifying the chaos. After Deng Xiaoping came back to work, he proactively focused on science and technology education. He overturned the imposed "Black Line Dictatorship in Literature and Art" and "Black Line Dictatorship in Education" theories by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and others. He emphasized that in the seventeen years after the founding of New China, the dominant aspect of the science and education front was the "red line", and the majority of intellectuals in our country consciously and willingly served socialism. He called for "respecting intellectual labor and talent", and put forward scientific theories such as "science and technology are productive forces" and "intellectual laborers who serve socialism are part of the working people". He continued the correct propositions of the Party in 1956 and 1962 regarding intellectuals, reversing the long-standing "leftist" policies and ideas towards intellectuals. The majority of intellectuals were greatly encouraged, and various scientific research and academic activities, as well as literary and artistic creations, gradually became active. The examination system in schools, which was abolished during the "Cultural Revolution", was restored, and national higher education institutions resumed enrolling new students through unified examinations. The field of culture and education welcomed the early spring atmosphere, becoming one of the earlier areas to rectify and achieve results. These significant measures gradually undermined the impact of traditional concepts and strongly promoted the pace of ideological liberation.
In conclusion, after the end of the "Cultural Revolution", significant achievements were made in exposing and criticizing the crimes of the counter-revolutionary group led by Jiang Qing. Rectification efforts started at various levels of the Party and state organizations, and some unjust cases were reviewed and redressed. Industrial and agricultural production recovered relatively quickly. Education, science, and cultural work also began to normalize. However, it is not easy to eliminate the political and ideological chaos caused by the ten years of the "Cultural Revolution" in the short term. More importantly, the rectification of the mistakes on the "left" cannot simply focus on the rectification of the "Cultural Revolution". A profound and extensive rectification in the ideological domain is imperative.
Secondly, the widespread discussion on the standard of truth and the basic establishment of the Marxist ideological line
An accurate understanding of the general principles of Marxism and the fundamental significance of practice to the development of Marxism (or the "primacy of practice") are the two basic conditions that must be possessed in order to sinicize Marxism. If the term "complete and accurate Mao Zedong Thought" mainly refers to the understanding of the theory itself, then the proposal of the standard of truth goes a step further, raising the criteria for judging the correctness of theories, gradually delving into the realm of practice. By restoring the authority of practice, the foundation of dogmatism is shaken.
As various work gradually unfolded, people increasingly realized that in order to thoroughly clarify the ideological confusion caused by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" and correct the errors of the "Cultural Revolution", it is first necessary to solve the fundamental problem of how to correctly handle Mao Zedong's instructions and decisions. What is the standard for determining historical right and wrong? This raises the fundamental question of the standard of truth. Deng Xiaoping and other veteran revolutionaries repeatedly stressed the need to accurately and fully understand Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing that seeking truth from facts is the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. In fact, this further opened the door to liberation of thought after the overthrow of the "Gang of Four", activated the democratic atmosphere within and outside the Party, and provided a foundation for seeking truth from facts. Cadres and theoretical workers who sought to break free from the shackles of the "Two Whatevers" were greatly inspired and encouraged, thus triggering a debate on whether to adhere to seeking truth from facts or adhere to the "Two Whatevers" ideological line. Some cadres and theoretical workers who were at the forefront of the struggle against chaos and rectification roughly simultaneously raised this question and prepared and wrote articles to discuss this issue. Because they represented the correct direction of Marxist development, they received support from some senior Party cadres. With the support and promotion of the older generation of revolutionaries, the major discussion on the standard of truth broke through numerous obstacles and started vigorously nationwide.
1. "Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth" is a Marxist concept. 
In August 1977, under the organization and guidance of Hu Yaobang, the Central Party School established an internal publication called "Theoretical Trends," which was provided for the reference of provincial, military-level, and above leadership cadres and theoretical work departments. The publication organized articles on important frontiers of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to clarify the theoretical confusion that had existed for many years and to open up an active field. 
At the end of 1977, based on Hu Yaobang's opinions, the Central Party School clearly defined two guiding principles for studying the Party's history: first, it should comprehensively and accurately apply the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; second, it should use practice as the criterion for testing truth and distinguishing right from wrong in guiding principles. Inspired by these two principles, some students began to question certain major events in the "Cultural Revolution" and the theory of "continuing revolution." Some theoretical workers were brewing articles on the standard for testing truth, seeking to clarify the vague understanding on this issue. As the situation developed, the question gradually arose of what should be the criterion for judging right and wrong in guiding principles and ideological theories. 
On March 26, 1978, the People's Daily published a thought commentary entitled "There is only one criterion," explicitly stating: "There is only one criterion for truth, and that is social practice." After the article was published, more than twenty letters were received, with the majority expressing dissenting views on the article's standpoint, believing that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought were the criteria for testing truth. In response, the editorial department of the newspaper decided to continue organizing articles to further clarify this issue. 
On May 11, 1978, the front page of Guangming Daily published, under the name of "Specially Appointed Commentator of This Newspaper," an article titled "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth," which was reviewed and finalized by Hu Yaobang. This article emphasized that practice is not only the criterion for testing truth but also the only criterion. There is only one criterion for testing truth, which is the social practice of millions of people. The reason why Marxism is called the truth is precisely because it has been proven by the long-term practice of millions of people. The article pointed out that the unity of theory and practice is a fundamental principle of Marxism. The theoretical treasury of Marxism is not a pile of dead and unchanging dogmas; it must continuously add new viewpoints and conclusions in practice, and discard individual old viewpoints and conclusions that are no longer suitable for new circumstances. To adhere to practice as the sole criterion for testing truth is to adhere to Marxism. The article sharply pointed out that now, whether in theory or practical work, many "No-Go Zones" set up by the "Gang of Four" to restrict people's thinking have not been completely broken through. Wherever there are areas that transcend practice and hold themselves as absolute forbidden zones, there is no science, there is no genuine Marxism-Leninism or Mao Zedong Thought. Communists cannot restrict, control, or trim the infinitely rich and vivid real-life with ready-made formulas; they should be brave enough to study new problems raised in new practice. Only in this way can we have the correct attitude towards Marxism. This article took a firm stand and fundamentally denied the "Two Whatevers," and it also touched upon the problems of ideological rigidity, dogmatism, and personality cult that prevailed for many years, causing a strong response. The majority of Party members, cadres, and theoretical workers resolutely supported it, believing it was a good article that adhered to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and it raised a significant issue that would have far-reaching implications.
At this time, the central propaganda department, according to the instructions of relevant leaders, adopted a policy of "not taking a position" and "not intervening" in this discussion. The leader in charge of propaganda work also criticized this article on many occasions, saying that the article was directed at Chairman Mao's ideology, criticizing the responsible comrades of the newspaper that published this article for lacking party spirit, instructing the Red Flag magazine to be cautious in theory and to exercise control. At that time, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department also greeted the leaders in charge of propaganda in various provinces, saying that the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" could be discussed in a small circle, and different opinions could be expressed; it should not be assumed that once the People's Daily reprinted it and Xinhua News Agency published it, it became final. One should use one's nose to sniff it out and not go with the wind. In this way, a sharp debate on the principle differences that relate to the Party's ideological line was placed squarely before the entire Party. The rectification of ideological confusion on the ideological front reached a critical moment.
2. Restoring the authority of practice in the discussion on the criterion of truth
When the discussion on the criterion of truth was under great pressure, a group of veteran comrades including Deng Xiaoping, Ye Jianying, Chen Yun, and Li Xiannian expressed their support, enabling this discussion to withstand the pressure and expand from the intellectual and theoretical circles to various sectors of the Party, government, and military, becoming a mass-based discussion.
At that time, a military political work conference was held in Beijing. Some people emphasized that nothing Chairman Mao or Chairman Hua said could be changed. Deng Xiaoping paid attention to this situation as well as the differences of opinion arising from the proposal of the criterion of truth. On June 2nd, Deng Xiaoping made a speech at the conference, emphasizing the viewpoint of seeking truth from facts. He criticized some comrades for always talking about Mao Zedong Thought, but often forgetting, abandoning, or even opposing the fundamental Marxist viewpoint and method of seeking truth from facts, starting from reality, and combining theory with practice. Moreover, some people even believed that anyone who adhered to seeking truth from facts was committing a grave crime. He believed that this problem was not a minor one, but involved how to view Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If one opposes seeking truth from facts, it can no longer be said to adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, but will only lead us to idealism and metaphysics, leading to the loss of work and the failure of the revolution. He called on everyone, "We must eradicate the influence of Lin Biao and the 'Gang of Four,' rectify the confusion, break the mental shackles, and achieve great liberation of our thoughts." This speech powerfully refuted the absurd argument that upholding the standard of practice is to "cut the flag," shaking up those comrades whose thinking was still in a rigid state, and inspiring comrades who demanded the liberation of thought and the adherence to the standard of practice. The policy of seeking truth from facts, starting from reality and combining theory with practice quickly became a sharp weapon in the whole Party's emancipation of thought.
Freeing the mind and seeking truth from facts has always been an important magic weapon for our party to maintain vitality, and it is also the prerequisite for the continuous Sinicization and modernization of Marxism. Freeing the mind refers to breaking the shackles of habitual forces and subjective prejudices under the guidance of Marxism, studying new situations, and solving new problems. Freeing the mind means aligning thoughts with reality and aligning subjectivity with objectivity, which is opposing dogmatism and seeking truth from facts. Only by freeing the mind can we achieve seeking truth from facts; only by seeking truth from facts can we truly free our minds. After the founding of New China, our party has had several successful experiences in promoting socialist construction exploration through ideological liberation. Before and after the 8th National Congress of the Party, Mao Zedong proposed the policy of "learning from the Soviet Union", which laid a good foundation for independent exploration of China's own path of socialist construction and achieved positive results. During the comprehensive adjustment period in the early 1960s, Mao Zedong called on the entire party to vigorously promote investigation and research. The people throughout the country responded actively, and the work in all aspects made a breakthrough, and the correct or relatively correct development trend of socialist construction was achieved for a period of time. However, due to the influence of dogmatism, especially the lack of democracy within the party and the expansion of class struggle and other "left" mistakes, the liberation of thought either became unrealistic under the guidance of "left" thinking (such as "Great Leap Forward" and the people's commune movement), or it faced numerous difficulties and was even suffocated by new dogmatism. This may indicate that, overall, the conditions were not yet mature at that time for freeing the mind, breaking through dogmatism, and putting Marxism in China on the right track. However, after the calamity of the "Cultural Revolution" and repeated struggles between the two development trends within the party, the conditions have finally matured. Against the backdrop of gradually recovering and active democratic atmosphere inside and outside the party, the principles of freeing the mind and seeking truth from facts can finally be put into practice.
With the support of Deng Xiaoping and others, some newspapers and magazines continued to organize discussions, and some units began to prepare for symposiums on the issue of the criterion of truth. On June 24th, with the support and instructions of Luo Ruiqing, Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, an article entitled "A Fundamental Principle of Marxism" was published on the front page of the PLA Daily under the name of "specially commissioned commentator". The article systematically answered the criticisms against the principle that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth from a theoretical perspective. The article clearly pointed out that thought cannot prove itself, theory is the guide of practice, and practice is the criterion for testing truth. These are two different questions and should not be confused with each other. The idealism and metaphysics of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" were particularly prominent in their views on truth. For a long time, they regarded truth as something that is shifted by subjective thoughts of people; they took theories themselves, statements by authoritative figures, or what was written in documents as the criteria for judging truth, but ignored objective practice. The harm and the extreme wickedness of this can be felt by almost everyone. Following that, several major newspapers in the capital published and reprinted relevant articles, which powerfully promoted the discussion on the criterion of truth.
Deng Xiaoping closely monitored the development of the discussion and guided its direction with his superb political wisdom and strong measures. On July 22nd, during a conversation with Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping said, "The article 'Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth' is Marxist. It is inevitable to have debates, and the root of the problem lies in the 'two whatevers'." In September, he once again explained how to emancipate the mind and hold high the banner. He pointed out that how to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought was a big question. The "two whatevers" do not represent holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Continuing in this way would harm Mao Zedong Thought. The essence of Mao Zedong Thought is seeking truth from facts, which means combining the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. The essence of Mao Zedong Thought is precisely seeking truth from facts. Deng Xiaoping's proposal received clear support from Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, and others, which further deepened the discussion. During the discussion, everyone pointed out that this issue is not only a fundamental theoretical issue, but also an essential practical issue. The discussion of this issue is related to our ideological and political line, as well as the future of our party and country.
3. The discussion and resolution of the issue of the criterion of truth solved the problem of our party's ideological line. 
It was a great movement of ideological emancipation and also a major debate concerning the correct attitude towards Marxism. It came at a critical moment when our socialist cause was facing difficulties and wavering. It broke the spiritual shackles of the "two whatevers" and used scientific theories and irrefutable facts to prove that the "two whatevers" are not only anti-Marxism but also impractical in practice. This promoted people's restoration and respect for the authority of practice, deeply embedding the idea that "practice is the sole criterion for testing truth" in people's minds. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "The debate about the criterion of truth is indeed an issue of ideological line, a political issue, and a question concerning the future and destiny of the Party and the country." He profoundly explained the extreme importance of the ideological line, saying, "If a party, a country, or a nation is stagnant, superstitious, and holds onto dogma, it cannot move forward and its vitality will cease, leading to the demise of the party and country." "Only with ideological emancipation can we correctly uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, solve past and newly emerging problems, properly reform the production relations and superstructure that are inconsistent with the rapid development of productive forces, and based on the actual conditions of our country, determine the specific path, principles, methods, and measures to achieve the Four Modernizations."
The extensive and in-depth discussion on the criterion of truth provided a comprehensive education in dialectical and historical materialism for a wide range of cadres and masses. It forcefully promoted the ideological and theoretical thorough denouncement of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" pseudo-Marxist theories, as well as the correction of Mao Zedong's errors in his later years. It laid the foundation for a large-scale rectification of chaos, a return to the fundamentals, and the resolution of historical legacy issues. From then on, the Party gradually freed itself from the influence of the "two whatevers" and pragmatically dealt with various problems encountered in the rectification of chaos. The organizational departments vigorously rectified erroneous and false cases, stating that regardless of the circumstances or who criticized, all cases that need to be cleared will be cleared; some industrial departments resolutely implemented the principle of distribution according to work, restoring some effective practices previously criticized; in rural work, leaders in places like Anhui and Sichuan boldly adjusted rural policies based on practical conditions, gradually introducing the contracting household responsibility system and overall contracting, correcting some "leftist" practices that had been in place for many years...
The in-depth discussion on the criterion of truth has further encouraged many cadres and theorists to criticize some representative "left-wing" theoretical viewpoints. The discussion on the issue of distribution according to work in the economic theory community, which started in February 1977, has been deepening since the discussion on the criterion of truth began. This discussion focused on criticizing the fallacies such as regarding distribution according to work as the economic foundation that generates bourgeoisie rights and regarding the development of production as "the theory of productive forces". More importantly, the discussion further delved into how to embody the principle of distribution according to work in practice. On May 5, 1978, an article titled "Implementing the Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Work" was published in the People's Daily, receiving full affirmation from Deng Xiaoping and Li Xiannian. The article comprehensively demonstrated the socialist nature of distribution according to work, expounded on various forms of labor remuneration based on work, cleared up theoretical errors and confusion concerning distribution according to work, and caused a great impact in the theoretical community.
In summary, the discussion on the criterion of truth, based on the return of Marxism to a practical approach with Chinese characteristics, has sharply raised the question of attitude towards Marxism, fundamentally rectifying the direction of the Sinicization of Marxism. This is: to adhere to the emancipation of thinking, seek truth from facts, start with the reality, and combine theory with practice. Only in this way can Marxism have vitality and the great practice of socialist construction in our country have a clear direction. This discussion also vigorously promotes people to break free from the shackles of dogmatism, emancipate their thinking, boldly practice, dare to create, test and develop truth in practice, and continuously give birth to new achievements in the Sinicization of Marxism. History has shown that the transformation from the state of deviation in the Sinicization of Marxism to a new leap forward has already begun.
III. The new starting point of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the initial stage of the second historical leap in the Sinicization of Marxism
1. The liberation of thought promotes new explorations
The rectification of ideological lines is the precursor and prerequisite for all rectifications and the reform and opening up. "Only by emancipating our minds, persisting in seeking truth from facts, starting from reality, and connecting theory with practice, can we smoothly carry out our socialist modernization construction, and the theory of our Party's Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought can also develop smoothly." In this sense, the discussion on the criterion of truth is also the prerequisite for Marxism to return to the correct path and achieve the second historical leap in the Sinicization of Marxism.
The main content of the discussion against the "Two Whatevers" and the standard of truth has vigorously promoted various new explorations. These explorations not only originate from some correct practices before the "Cultural Revolution", such as the Tola experiment and the household responsibility system in agriculture, but also more from reflections after the setbacks of the "Cultural Revolution". The new explorations not only negate the "Cultural Revolution" itself, but also begin to reflect on the socialist construction model in the decade before the "Cultural Revolution". Therefore, this discussion essentially becomes a strong call for the ideological liberation movement of great transformation in the new era of socialism in China, a movement that provides spiritual motivation and thinking for the reform and development of socialism in the new era in China, and thus a movement that is related to the entire political situation. It is for these reasons that this discussion has made sufficient ideological and theoretical preparations for the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and has become a new historical starting point for the second leap of the sinicization of Marxism. The new results of exploring the development of socialism brought about by ideological liberation are multifaceted. They are manifested in the understanding of the external environment of socialist construction, the reflection on the lessons of China's socialist construction experience, the brewing of the reform and opening up policy and the shift of work priorities, and the thinking on major issues such as China's future development path...
2. Expand global exchanges and broaden global perspectives
Having a global perspective and an open awareness is an important condition for the sinicization of Marxism. From a historical perspective, the founding of the Communist Party of China was the result of the combination of the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China and the actual Chinese workers' movement, and the spread of Marxism in China itself was the result of ideological openness at that time. However, during the "Cultural Revolution", when it easily claimed to be the "center of world revolution" and the "third milestone in the development of Marxism", its understanding of the outside world was very limited. After suffering serious damage to the sinicization of Marxism due to closed and dogmatic concepts, it became an urgent task for the whole Party to achieve openness, absorb the positive results of world civilization development, draw lessons from the successful practices of other socialist countries, and thus achieve new development in the sinicization of Marxism. In the period before the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's foreign exchanges increased rapidly, which enabled the Party to have a new understanding of the modernization process of the contemporary world and a broader vision for socialist construction. In 1978, there were 20 visits by Vice Premiers and Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress, and more than 50 countries were visited, including both developing countries and developed capitalist countries. Among them, the most remarkable one was Deng Xiaoping's visit to Japan in October 1978. During the visit, Deng Xiaoping specifically gained a detailed understanding and investigation of the internationally advanced modern enterprises and high-tech facilities in Japan, expressing a strong desire to learn from the advanced experience and technology of foreign countries and accelerate the pace of China's modernization construction.
In addition to the visits by leaders of the Party Central Committee, various departments of the State Council, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions organized delegations and inspection teams in that year, focusing on the production of industry, agriculture, and economic development in developed capitalist countries. The largest and highest-level one was the visit of the Chinese government delegation led by Vice Premier Gu Mu to five Western European countries. Before their departure, Deng Xiaoping specifically talked to Gu Mu and instructed them to conduct detailed research and emphasized the need to learn from the advanced experience of capitalism. The delegation visited fifteen cities in five countries and had extensive contacts with the government leaders and people from all walks of life in these countries. Such frequent and extensive visits not only attracted the attention of the Chinese people, but also made countries around the world feel that China is moving towards the world with a new attitude!
Through gradually increasing external exchanges, the Party has gained a more direct and comprehensive understanding of the development and changes in the international situation and the trend of world economic development. Based on this, the Party Central Committee has made a series of important judgments and decisions in a timely manner.
On the one hand, it changed the perception that "world war is imminent" that was once held. In September 1977, Deng Xiaoping mentioned during a meeting with foreign guests, "The international situation has changed significantly, many old concepts and formulas no longer reflect reality, and old strategic regulations from the past are also no longer applicable." He said, "We need a peaceful environment." In December of the same year, Deng Xiaoping proposed the judgment that the outbreak of world war may be delayed during a full meeting of the Central Military Commission. This judgment gradually became the consensus of the central leadership.
On the other hand, decisions were made to seize favorable opportunities and open up to the outside world. Through various exchanges, the Party and the government gained a relatively comprehensive understanding of the development and changes in the international situation and economic trends, and timely adjustments were made to the foreign economic policy. In September 1977, Deng Xiaoping mentioned, "We should not only learn advanced science and technology, but also absorb advanced industrial management methods from the world." In March 1978, Hua Guofeng also proposed, "Introducing advanced technology and equipment is an important measure to accelerate economic development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in 1975 that this is a major policy; introducing also needs to have a long-term plan, and comprehensive considerations." On March 18, 1978, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech at the National Science Congress, "Modern science and technology are undergoing a great revolution. To improve our scientific and technological level, we must adhere to the principles of independence, self-reliance. However, any nation or country needs to learn from the strengths of other nations and countries and learn their advanced science and technology." In 1978, the central government specially established a leading group for introducing new technology, accelerating the pace of introduction.
Dogmatism and ideological rigidness are products of closed and semi-closed systems. Once normal external exchanges and a broad world vision are established, it becomes difficult to maintain them. Opening the country and expanding horizons are not only the products of ideological liberation but also provide greater impetus to ideological liberation. Breaking free from the shackles of isolation not only brings us abundant material achievements but also tremendous ideological achievements. Taking this step has provided a more solid foundation for the modernization of Marxism and the Sinicization of Marxism.
3. New understanding of socialism during the planning of reform and opening up and the shift in work priorities
After the discussion on the standard of truth opened the door to ideological liberation, the Party began to rethink how to build socialism in China. In 1978, the policy of reform and opening up was being prepared, and a shift in work priorities was also starting to be considered. Finally, around the time of the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, the door was opened for the second leap in the Sinicization of Marxism.
In response to the low level of economic management in our country at that time, the Party Central Committee put forward the proposition of reforming our country's economic management system. Deng Xiaoping explicitly stated, "After introducing advanced technology and equipment, we must manage it according to internationally advanced management methods, advanced business methods, and advanced norms, that is, manage the economy according to economic laws. In a word, we must revolutionize instead of reforming, and we must not just make minor adjustments." In June 1978, Hua Guofeng pointed out, "Many aspects of our superstructure and production relations are still imperfect, and many aspects of our political and economic systems have flaws. They are not adapted to the requirements of achieving the Four Modernizations and hinder the development of productivity. Therefore, we must have the courage to resolutely and properly reform the parts of the superstructure and production relations that are incompatible with the development of productive forces."
From July 6th to September 9th, at the brainstorming meeting convened by the State Council, more than sixty heads of relevant departments who attended the meeting, based on a careful summary of the experience and lessons since the founding of New China, put forward suggestions to reform the economic management system and actively introduce advanced technology and capital from abroad. In his concluding speech, Li Xiannian pointed out, "To achieve the Four Modernizations, it is a great revolution that fundamentally changes the backward economic and technological situation in our country. This revolution must not only greatly change the current backward productive forces, but also necessarily change production relations, the superstructure, the management methods of industrial and agricultural enterprises, and the management methods of the state towards industrial and agricultural enterprises. It must change people's ways of activity and thinking to adapt to the needs of modern large-scale economy. Therefore, in economic leadership work, we must resolutely get rid of the old framework of sticking to the administrative level and administrative methods without paying attention to economic accounting, economic effects, and economic responsibilities, break the narrow vision of small-scale production, change the management methods of handicraft-style and small-scale agriculture-style, and even feudal-style, and master the ability to lead and manage modern industrial and agricultural large-scale production. In order to carry out reform deployments according to the new requirements, the National Planning Conference held from September 24th to October 22nd proposed that three transformations must be implemented in economic work: First, shift the focus to production struggle and technological revolution; second, shift from the bureaucratic management system and management methods to the track of scientific management based on economic laws; third, shift from a closed or semi-closed state to actively introducing foreign capital and advanced technology, and boldly entering the open policy of the international market.
As the discussion on the issue of truth standards gradually deepened and the calls for reform and opening up from within and outside the party became increasingly strong, Deng Xiaoping conducted an inspection tour of the three provinces in Northeast China in September 1978, making another important ideological mobilization on liberating the mind and developing productivity through reform and opening up. In his speech, he pointed out, "The key issue in front of us now is seeking truth from facts, combining theory with practice, and starting from reality. This is a political issue, a ideological issue, and also a practical issue for us to achieve the Four Modernizations. "We now need to achieve the Four Modernizations. We have many conditions that Comrade Mao Zedong didn't have when he was alive. If the central leadership does not think about and make decisions based on the present conditions, many problems cannot be raised or solved." "The world changes every day, new things constantly emerge, and new problems constantly arise. We cannot stay locked up and cannot move forward if we don't use our brains." He emphasized, "According to Marxism, the ultimate goal is to develop productive forces. We are too poor, too backward. Frankly speaking, we owe the people an apology. We must now develop productive forces and improve people's living conditions." "Socialism needs to demonstrate its superiority. How can we continue like this? After more than 20 years, we are still so poor. What's the point of socialism?" "We should advocate and educate all cadres to think independently, and boldly reform unreasonable things." Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his inspection tour of the Northeast caused a huge response among the cadres. After a period of brewing, the policy of reform and opening up became the consensus of the majority of the party, creating conditions for opening up a new development path for China.
The deepening of the ideological liberation movement and the advancement of various work have continuously broken through the ideological inertia of "class struggle as the central task" and the restrictions of "criticizing the Gang of Four as the central task," prompting the discussion on the shift of work priorities to be put on the agenda. In March 1977, the National Planning Conference specifically emphasized the chaos in thinking created by the Gang of Four in the economic field, stating that enterprises should focus on production and all work should serve production. Subsequently, in the nationwide discussion on issues such as labor distribution conducted by the economic theory community, some comrades criticized the Gang of Four's accusation of "economic determinism" by citing relevant statements from Lenin and Mao Zedong, particularly emphasizing the extreme importance of developing productivity after the proletariat seizes power.
Shortly after Deng Xiaoping returned to work, he began to consider how to break through the "class struggle as the central task" and shift the focus of the party's work. On August 23, 1977, he pointed out at a symposium of the Military Commission, "For the current situation, the struggle to criticize and repudiate the Gang of Four is our central task, and we must carry out this struggle to the end, but there must be a time limit." As the rectification progress deepened on various fronts, the reflection on the development path of our country and the brewing of the policy of reform and opening up within the Party also indicated that economic construction was increasingly becoming the focus of the whole Party's attention. In this context, Deng Xiaoping timely raised the issue of shifting the work focus of the entire Party. In his speech during his visit to the Northeast in September 1978, Deng Xiaoping explicitly stated, "The main purpose of this movement is to improve the team and improve the working style. It can be done in half a year. The movement cannot be carried out for too long, or people will get tired." On October 11, in his speech at the 9th National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, he further stated: "The struggle to criticize and repudiate the Gang of Four has decisively won victory on a broad national scale, and we have been able to begin new tasks based on this victory," and this new task is to drastically change the current backward productivity, change the backward production relations and superstructure, and achieve the Four Modernizations.
Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned opinions quickly gained consensus among the central leadership, thereby providing more sufficient conditions for making the decision to shift the work focus of the entire Party and achieving a historical turning point for the Party and the country.
4. A New Starting Point for the Second Leap of the Sinicization of Marxism
After the end of the "Cultural Revolution," after two years of hesitation and various preparations, the conditions for the shift of the work focus of the Party and the state have basically matured. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee held at the end of 1978 completed this momentous historical turning point.
The Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee is recorded in the annals of history as a new starting point for reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction, and is also recorded in the annals of history because it rectified the direction of Marxist development. It thus became a new starting point for the development of Marxism in China, the second leap of the Sinicization of Marxism, and it was also the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism - a new starting point for the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
From November 10 to December 15, 1978, the Party Central Committee held a work conference in Beijing. On December 13, Deng Xiaoping delivered a speech entitled "Liberate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, and Unite as One to Look Forward" at the closing ceremony. He warned the entire Party, "If we do not carry out reforms, our modernization and socialist cause will be buried." With the push from the older generation of revolutionaries and the joint efforts of the majority of participants, this 36-day central work conference finally broke the shackles of the "two whatevers" policy and turned the originally planned conference to discuss economic work into a conference to prepare for a comprehensive rectification and open up new prospects. Deng Xiaoping's speech actually became the theme report of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee that was subsequently held.
After sufficient preparation by the Central Working Conference, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from December 18th to 22nd, 1978. The plenary session broke free from the long-term serious constraints of the "left" errors, criticized the wrong policies of "Two Whatevers," and clearly pointed out the necessity to comprehensively and accurately grasp the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. The plenary session highly evaluated the discussions on the issue of truth standards, reestablished the ideological, political, and organizational lines of Marxism, and made strategic decisions to shift the focus of the Party and the country's work to socialist modernization construction and implement the policy of reform and opening up. The plenary session solemnly pointed out: "The sublime task of the Party Central Committee on the theoretical front is to lead and educate the entire Party and the people of the whole country to historically and scientifically understand the great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong, accurately grasp the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought, combine the universal principles of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practices of socialist modernization construction, and develop them in new historical conditions." This is the restoration of the basic principles of Marxist sinicization and will definitely open up a new path for Marxist sinicization.
In this way, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee ended the situation where the Party had been wavering for two years after the defeat of the "Gang of Four," and ended the confusion and wavering of Marxist sinicization, achieving a great turning point in the history of the Party and the development process of Marxist sinicization since the founding of the People's Republic of China. As Deng Xiaoping said, "Our true turning point was the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee held at the end of 1978. The plenary session formulated new guidelines, policies, ideological, political, and organizational lines."
The speech by Deng Xiaoping, titled "Liberate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, Unite as One and Forge Ahead," which served as the theme report of the plenary session, became a manifesto for the critical historical moment China faced after the end of the "Cultural Revolution," breaking free from the constraints of "Two Whatevers" and opening up a new era and creating a new theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The so-called new era refers to the new starting point in history with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee as its beginning, with reform and opening up as its distinct feature, and with comprehensive socialist modernization as its central task, which is unwavering. It is also a new era that marks the second historic leap in the sinicization of Marxism.
The so-called new path is to build on the great achievements of socialist construction that have been made since the founding of the People's Republic of China, inherit all the correct and relatively correct experiences accumulated by our Party in leading socialist construction, correct the long-standing "left" errors, face new situations, solve new problems, and thus open up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is a new leap for Marxist sinicization.
The so-called new theory is to adhere to, develop, and inherit Mao Zedong Thought, correct the mistakes of Mao Zedong's later years, combine Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions and characteristics of the times, and develop as the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the Marxism of contemporary China. It is also a new achievement of the second historic leap in the sinicization of Marxism.
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Communist Party of China has adhered to the ideological line of Marxism, continuously promoted the sinicization of Marxism and modernization, and historic changes have taken place in the appearance of the Chinese people, socialist China, and the Communist Party of China. And these changes cannot be separated from the ideological emancipation movement that took place in the two years before the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, as well as the rectification and normalization of various work after the chaos of the "Cultural Revolution." These two years were a period of progress from wavering to great historical turning points, a period of direct preparation and full brewing for achieving the sinicization of Marxism, and a period when the sinicization of Marxism gradually got back on track from twists and turns. In these two years:
Through criticism and struggle against the "two whatever" principles, the scientific attitude in understanding Mao Zedong Thought was clarified, laying the ideological foundation for breaking away from dogmatism and ossification regarding Mao Zedong Thought. 
Through discussions on the criteria of truth, it was made clear that all basic theories of Marxism, including Mao Zedong Thought, need to be examined. The criterion for examination is social practice. Practice is colorful and ever-changing, and theory itself needs to constantly develop.
By reversing wrongful cases and accelerating the process of rehabilitating retired cadres, up until the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee where Deng Xiaoping de facto became the core leader of the Party, the foundations of leadership, grassroots cadres, and organizations were prepared for historical turning points. In this process, with his rich revolutionary experience and outstanding leadership abilities, Deng Xiaoping demonstrated tremendous political courage and wisdom, as well as significant theoretical courage and level of expertise. He became the founder and architect of socialist theory with Chinese characteristics, achieving a new leap in the sinicization of Marxism and tightly linking contemporary Chinese Marxism to his name.
Through heated discussions on major theoretical issues and struggles against "left" leaning thoughts in various fields, the restoration and development of democracy within the Party were promoted. During this period, the atmosphere of democracy and the freedom to discuss issues were relatively strong, differing opinions could be expressed, and diverse thoughts collided. Deng Xiaoping emphasized that "democracy is an important condition for liberating thoughts." The ideological liberation movement stirred by the issue of truth standards gradually broke the shackles of mental bondage and ideological despotism, dismantling the influence of dogmatism and personality worship. The democratic awareness of cadres and masses began to awaken, independent thinking became a trend of the times, and many issues were gradually clarified through thorough discussions, providing favorable conditions for the development and innovation of Marxism.
Through advancing corrections in all aspects and breaking through "left" leaning policies, complemented by the ideological liberation movement, an unstoppable trend was formed, accelerating the process of historical turning points and laying a broad mass foundation for the sinicization of Marxism.
By studying new situations and solving new problems, new theoretical achievements were nurtured. Deng Xiaoping once said at the 1978 National Military Political Work Conference, "If we simply copy and paste some old documents word for word, we cannot solve any problems, let alone correctly solve them." He also said, "The world is changing every day, new things constantly emerge, new problems constantly appear. We can't solve anything if we shut ourselves off and don't use our brains. We have many conditions for achieving the Four Modernizations that Mao Zedong didn't have when he was alive, but we have them now." The process of sinicization of Marxism is a continuous combination of basic principles of Marxism with the practicality and characteristics of contemporary China. Faced with the ever-changing domestic and international situation, closing one's eyes and ears is not the solution. The only correct approach is to study new situations and solve new problems. It is precisely with the keenness to discover new problems and the ability to solve them that ideological liberation becomes possible, allowing for the summarization of new experiences, the creation of new generalizations, and the constant advancement of theory, thus promoting new leaps in the sinicization of Marxism.
